1.0,Stay away from finance/costing,"Culture at the site I worked at was toxic, with no work life balance. All teams at the site were expected to work long hours and be available 24/7. I was nonchalantly asked by my manager to log on and work Saturdays and Sundays fairly often. The finance and costing team in Mesa and Austin is run extremely lean, with no backfilling of roles, no support or training from management.

The onboarding was rushed and sloppy and I was unable to receive proper user accesses to do my work for several months. Zero training or support when help was needed, it's a sink or swim environment. It really seemed like they truly did not care and no preparation was done for my role before my start date, just that they needed a warm body to fill a seat.

All in all, a really unfortunate and bad experience, and it's no surprise they are unable to keep people around and have such high turnover in finance.",,,Finance,Former Employee,United States,"February 7, 2023"

3.0,"Customer Logistics Management (CLM) - Dublin, Ireland","High staff rotation and you end up with quite a big portfolio of customers to look after. Tasks are quite repetitive and you have absolutely no influence whatsoever to solve issues - you simply depend on management to take decisions, but you are the one having to face customers and having to listen to their rants 24/7.
For the last year it has been one escalation after the other, customers complaining about delivery delays, business has grown so much that the company should employ double the amount of the staff that they have at the moment.
Benefits are OK, but there is no flexibility and you end up doing overtime pretty much every day because the demand coming from customer is just too high and it's impossible to fulfill properly.
You are supposed to be some sort of supply chain specialist, but you simply work in a glorified call center.","Travel ticket, health insurance, pension scheme, central location in Dublin city","Very stressful environment, high turnover, repetitive tasks, no career opportunities",Customer Logistics Management (CLM),Former Employee,"Dublin, County Dublin","September 29, 2021"

But all the individual players support and encourage one another for the most part, and there is a generally positive company culture.",,,Sr. Business Manager,Current Employee,California,"September 14, 2021"
4.0,"Not a bad company, it all depends on who your supervisor and line managers are.",The top management dictates a lot of things without consensus from the employees.

1.0,Bias Management,"Need to change management especially in Austin Texas, they don't care about their employees. Pay not enough. Management keeps promoting employees that are not even qualified to do their tasks. Training SUCKS!!!! Need new management in ALL department..",,,Operator,Former Employee,"Austin, TX","July 11, 2021"
3.0,"Wonderful work/life balance, terrible management.","Twelve hour shifts means lots more time off. It also means that if you’re used to a lot of physical activity, this place will make you think twice on your fourth day of work in a row. My hips won’t ever recover, I think.

Even that wasn’t a big deal. Lots of time off means I’ll gladly work through the pain to get there. No, what irks me most is the management that doesn’t seem to care about the amount of pain their employees are in and instead care about production metrics because the size of their bonuses. I was routinely complained at by my manager for sitting to rest for two minutes. Never mind the fact that my bay was in ship shape and all the tools were loaded and working fine. No, that only meant I should find something else to do after having just literally walked two miles in an hour, back and forth from the stocker to the machines in the bay.

The job is easy. The managers pushing you to do more, never mind your health, are evil. Sound like a familiar company sharing a name with a rainforest?

Insurance is fine. Pay could always be better. Cool that there’s a cafe and convenience store on site, not cool that everything is hilariously overpriced and the cafeteria is the only thing that doesn’t operate 24/7.

We were told we should care about production metrics. We were never given any incentive to do so. Raises are too infrequent and too small to be worth concerning yourself with.

People are not robots. Stop treating them like they are.",,,Wafer Fab Machine Operator,Current Employee,"Austin, TX","July 8, 2021"
2.0,Poorly Managed,Working here comes with a lot of unfulfilled promises and lack of appreciation. Compensation is poor and management does not value the effort of its employees.,,,Material Handler/Warehouse Associate,Former Employee,"Mesa, AZ","June 24, 2021"
2.0,Easy job but can be bad for your mental health.,"Very easy job once you get the hang of it and the work life balance is great but standing and working the 12 hours you’re there can feel like an eternity. No music or anything to distract you from your thoughts while you’re wearing a smok all day, it becomes mentally and physically exhausting.

So staff move on to make their fortune on ideas that Infineon knows 100% about were told about and people begged managers at Infineon to fund, but they do not.

- Management is usually very incompetent and has no interpersonal skills whatsoever. This is mostly due to the fact they are usually promoted on the basis of seniority and not merit or skill.
- Even if you go the extra mile to achieve all your targets and get involved in different projects and initiatives, don't expect your Team Leader to praise you or to give you any recognition for your efforts. The lack of encouragement and support is extremely disheartening.

5.0,good company,"The expression day job is often used for a job one works in order to make ends meet while performing low-paying (or non-paying) work in their preferred vocation. Archetypal examples of this are the woman who works as a waitress (her day job) while she tries to become an actress, and the professional athlete who works as a laborer in the off season because he is currently only able to make the roster of a semi-professional team.

While many people do hold a full-time occupation, ""day job"" specifically refers to those who hold the position solely to pay living expenses so they can pursue, through low paying entry work, the job they really want (which may also be during the day). The phrase strongly implies that the day job would be quit, if only the real vocation paid a living wage.

The phrase ""don't quit your day job"" is a humorous response to a poor or mediocre performance not up to professional caliber.

5.0,Good place to work with the right shift,"A typical day at work starts immediately as you enter the cleanroom. While there you will be working constantly as there is little to no downtime. However, there are two paid thirty minute breaks and one unpaid 45 minute lunch.

Working here has taught me great time and risk management skills as well as the ability to train others in my line of work so that they can go about their daily duties more effectively.

Management here is good when they are directly above you but there is a severe disconnect past direct reports to your immediate manager. Thankfully, you don't often have to report to those above your immediate manager.

Workplace culture is up beat and with the right shift (being 1,2,3,4) swing shifts.

The hardest part of the job is making sure you don't fall behind. This requires an individual who can keep ahead of their workflow constantly while being able to function independently. While you can rely on others from time to time to pick up slack this will eventually be viewed in a negative context.
