Bonus highly dependent on your pay, higher your pay lower bonus in terms of months. Good for retirement when pay does not really matter","1. Not recommended for junior employees as junior employees (AVP & below) need to take on additional projects to promote while senior employees (VP) need not.
2. Very low increment (2% for non promotion years when salary is 6-7k and 4-7% for promotion) due to low benchmark set for ranks but is compensated for high bonus.
3. Any cash given out or off cycle adjustments will be taken into account in next year's bonus/increment. (i.e. No increment in 2021 due to less than ideal business performance, but was subsequently given a mid year adjustment due to business recovering. Mentioned was due to no increment during bonus earlier in the year. However, in 2022 bonus and increment cycle, mentioned that mid year adjustment was given resulting in lower/no increments.
4. Part of bonus paid out in shares which will be paid on the 3rd/4th/5th year from when the shares were issued. Part of the company's tactic as career hostage as these are given out to good performers, knowing that people junior employees might leave for better increments.
5. Management seem to emphasize on employee survey but takes ages to even try to improve. Most improvements are reactive measures.

Many incompetent product owners and project managers resulted in endless and meaningless tech discussions that often go (something) like this...

Middle Management: ""Can you draw a pair of lines that are parallel to each other? Oh! By the way, make them perpendicular too!""

Developers: ""Ermmm... a pair of lines can't be parallel and perpendicular at the same time.""

Many incompetent product owners and project managers resulted in endless and meaningless tech discussions that often go (something) like this...

Middle Management: ""Can you draw a pair of lines that are parallel to each other? Oh! By the way, make them perpendicular too!""

Developers: ""Ermmm... a pair of lines can't be parallel and perpendicular at the same time.""

2. Pushing the employees to come back to office at any costs.
3. No proper Software Development life cycle. You as a developer is responsible for architecture, design, code, test and deploy. If you are hard worker, the entire work will be on you.

The manager leading the team is super lost, nickname ""lost lamb"", has no clue what is going on, often wasting everyone's time on meaningless endeavours that has no value.
KPI and numbers fall from the sky, no real justification anywhere. 
This manager is terribly unequipped to lead, miscommunication and misdirection rampant, zero to negative value addition. Don't know who assigned him as manager, the PhD like for show only, data related question also don't know. Epic and speechless...
Worst is the ethics: distorting facts, inflating results, sabotaging and scapegoating behaviour, mostly to tear others down and exalt. 
No wonder no one wants to work in banks, and not surprise that my team has 7-8 resignations in 2021 alone, ever since this manager took over in 2020. The number will most probably increase. Yet this manager claims its ""bumpy period"", so bumpy that new joiners after 1 month resign. Nobody wants to work in this team, does not resonate with DBS PRIDE values at all.

Though innovation is encouraged, very little goes into production
Compensation is definitely lesser than expected
I did not have a good relationship with my manager - this can create a lot of issues in advancing in the bank, but I guess that's true for any place.

Thin twice before you join, I would recommend to join a lesser paying job with good work life balance and where employees are not treated like slaves.

So, When should basic requirement analysis be done? After pushing developers to start Dev? Whose responsibility is this? Well in most of DBS Ibgt teams it’s developer’s responsibility to get requirements etc etc.
4. People’s career is joke to them, it goes like there is a requirement and oh here is a person who looks free just give it to him. Does it match his career goals ? Does he have knowledge on it? Does he need to learn and deliver? Nothing is thought of and deadlines are set without considering anything just a random date when user needs.. that’s it.

1338,1,"Politics, lies and ridiculous expectations","Pros

- Good Development team
- Relatively good extra benefits","1. Poor upper management planning when it comes to tech projects. Basically, whatever they want, they just open their mouth and expect you to finish it with a random deadline based on how they feel.
- They will over-commit to a deadline without listening to the development team's advice and without any consideration of the current workload and manpower available for the task.

- Goals, product features, and objectives shifts. Eg. in sprint 1, the goal was to get Model A working. But at the end of sprint 1, Management suddenly expects Model A, B, and C to work.
- Upper management expects developers to make up for their poor planning and management skills in the form of working on Sundays and Saturdays till 2 am.

Result: Engineers are overworked, underappreciated and management only provides lip service with no compensation. (And yes, we have worked Sat and Sundays for 3 weeks in a row).


2. Poor pay, Politics, and lies. Pay is not adjusted to the market rate. Despite getting external concrete offers, management lied about trying to increase the pay rate to match. Management only provides lip service without even actually speaking with HR etc. They provide excuses like not having enough budget, then immediately hire 2 -3 more junior engineers whom I have to train and are less qualified but with a better salaray?!
Upper management only rewards those who talk and demand a lot, not those who actually do the work.

Results: creates a lot of distrust between employees and management. Causes a lot of fiction and distrust between colleagues as everyone is fighting to be heard. Also encourages solo work to be done than collaborative work.

3. Upper management hires managers that are unskilled in terms of soft skills and hard skills. This causes a lot of issues between upper management, middle management, and developers.

- Middle management would present things and deadlines to upper management with no regard for developers. Everyone is just focused on what they want.",AI/ML Engineer,Current Employee,Singapore,"Mar 3, 2022"

1361,1,'Horribly' Overwork Employee,#NAME?,"1. Assign heavy workload and expect things to be delivered within a short of time. Not because you have problem with time management, it is mainly because of understaff, meeting schedule too packed, more work piling up everyday, and work delay due to data source issues.
2. Long working hour because of workload too much and need to spend extra hours to do all the unnecessary trouble shooting thanks to the poor data migration process.
3. No work life balance. Not only you, your boss and your colleagues are all insanely hardworking. It's normal to work until 3-4am during Weekday. You thought you can take a break during Weekends, Annual Leave and Sick Leave? No way! You are entitled with 24days annual leave, but believe me, you will never use it for leisure purposes.
4. Nobody will care about your mental health and physical health. All they care is 'donation' and support 'volunteering' work outside of the company. So that branding can be promoted. 
5. High expectation from management and bosses, your works will never be appreciated.
6. Employee Turn-Over Rate is increasing. More and more people are leaving the company, at least 2-3 people you know will be leaving every month.
7. Meeting cultures are bad and some meetings are useless. You will spend one whole day to attend meeting, because most of the meetings last for at least 1hour,and some meetings are only 10% relevant to you or for your update/knowledge sharing only.
8. No time to do all those free courses, no time to do team bonding, no time to do small talk with your colleagues.
9. Bad planning and a lot of old problems need to clear. Some items have been pending for years or months, but nobody do it until you take the ownership.
10. People are not very helpful because they are too busy with their own work and clearing backlog. When you need help, the only way is to ping the person multiple times or escalate through emails cc his/her boss.",Senior Business Analyst,Current Employee,Singapore,"Dec 9, 2021"

Manager and upper management supported immensely when I was going through personal issues (loss of loved ones in family).
Good WFH options during the pandemic, as I am able to do 100% of my work from home, never had to go to office since the last one year.
Excellent increment, company rewards loyal employees.
Work load mostly manageable.
Some use cases are very fun to work in analytics.
Good hackathon and data focus, and frequent contests with rewards.
Free transport and coffee if you come to office, reimbursable internet bills if you are working from home.
Good coding culture. Some colleagues are brilliant in coding, you can learn a lot from them.
Insurance policy is great, got cashless claim on a surgery and it covered everything except a few antibiotics.
Separate flexible benefits that can be used for dental, gym membership, etc. Was able to get WFH office setup via the extra amount provided for pandemic related expenditure.
CTC documents are very transparent, no misleading options to inflate CTC.
Good gifts given by the company to employees.
Good training and focus on learning and development.
Mandatory block leave for all employees, very useful to relax.","It is a bank, so there are some restrictions on the work laptop and VPN, so you don't have a lot of freedom there.

1576,1,'Horribly' Overwork Employee,#NAME?,"1. Assign heavy workload and expect things to be delivered within a short of time. Not because you have problem with time management, it is mainly because of understaff, meeting schedule too packed, more work piling up everyday, and work delay due to data source issues.
2. Long working hour because of workload too much and need to spend extra hours to do all the unnecessary trouble shooting thanks to the poor data migration process.
3. No work life balance. Not only you, your boss and your colleagues are all insanely hardworking. It's normal to work until 3-4am during Weekday. You thought you can take a break during Weekends, Annual Leave and Sick Leave? No way! You are entitled with 24days annual leave, but believe me, you will never use it for leisure purposes.
4. Nobody will care about your mental health and physical health. All they care is 'donation' and support 'volunteering' work outside of the company. So that branding can be promoted. 
5. High expectation from management and bosses, your works will never be appreciated.
6. Employee Turn-Over Rate is increasing. More and more people are leaving the company, at least 2-3 people you know will be leaving every month.
7. Meeting cultures are bad and some meetings are useless. You will spend one whole day to attend meeting, because most of the meetings last for at least 1hour,and some meetings are only 10% relevant to you or for your update/knowledge sharing only.
8. No time to do all those free courses, no time to do team bonding, no time to do small talk with your colleagues.
9. Bad planning and a lot of old problems need to clear. Some items have been pending for years or months, but nobody do it until you take the ownership.
10. People are not very helpful because they are too busy with their own work and clearing backlog. When you need help, the only way is to ping the person multiple times or escalate through emails cc his/her boss.",Senior Business Analyst,Current Employee,Singapore,"Dec 9, 2021"

Work life balance is a joke here

Not paid proportionately, freshers (not IIT / NIT / IIM grads) might earn higher than a 6 years experienced, so negotiate higher initially. Due to high basic, tax deductions are very high, thanks to our Govt. as well

Notice period and buyout option are probably the worst

'C2E' LOB is probably the worst

Good technology stack but you might get a chance to watch those from distance only and work in normal business logic development with vanilla coding

Singapore management team is not employee focused

Always tend to get a workload of 5 people get done by 2 people only, that also reduce to 1 if possible

Work from home was usually possible always but management never encouraged or allowed any, just due to covid they were forced to allow it, that too late while others already started.

If anyone provides a negative feedback, they find out who that person is and take it on themselves to ruin their careers. My manager explicitly called out my name in a meeting and openly showed my feedback to my team members.
They can narrow down such feedback by slicing and dicing etc and use it to target individuals giving poor scores.
Then they waited for the year end review process to halt my progress and gave me bad ratings, without any proper communication, reasons and threaten to put me in performance improvement when i tried to be reasonable.

Great respect for the CEO and his vision who brought DBS to be the best bank in the world.,"Depending in which organization you sit, you might encounter toxic behaviour from management. I'm specifically referring to the Digital Consumer Banking Technology, Big Data / AI group, which I'm part of.

Its leader drives the group like a dictator, often imposing questionable choices, micromanaging every piece of work and showing zero respect for people who put their time and effort in designing the best possible solutions. She will completely overturn decisions taken by her team, and when things do not go as planned (often because of decisions that she took) she will start blaming people publicly, yelling and screaming at everyone in meetings. People are so afraid of her and worried for their job that they do not have the courage to go against her anymore. This has created a toxic environment where everyone is encouraged to ""suck up"" to her and blame someone else when things do not go as planned. 

During the course of the years I have seen her hiring very strong individuals, throwing them in the ""garbage"" and forcing them to leave after few months or years just because they started disagreeing with her decisions. The unfortunate thing is that the bank keeps loosing smart people just because of her toxic behaviour and her total lack of respect for any human being.

Great respect for the CEO and his vision who brought DBS to be the best bank in the world.,"Depending in which organization you sit, you might encounter toxic behaviour from management. I'm specifically referring to the Digital Consumer Banking Technology, Big Data / AI group, which I'm part of.

Its leader drives the group like a dictator, often imposing questionable choices, micromanaging every piece of work and showing zero respect for people who put their time and effort in designing the best possible solutions. She will completely overturn decisions taken by her team, and when things do not go as planned (often because of decisions that she took) she will start blaming people publicly, yelling and screaming at everyone in meetings. People are so afraid of her and worried for their job that they do not have the courage to go against her anymore. This has created a toxic environment where everyone is encouraged to ""suck up"" to her and blame someone else when things do not go as planned. 

During the course of the years I have seen her hiring very strong individuals, throwing them in the ""garbage"" and forcing them to leave after few months or years just because they started disagreeing with her decisions. The unfortunate thing is that the bank keeps loosing smart people just because of her toxic behaviour and her total lack of respect for any human being.

Work recognition is solely at her discretion and only people who has learnt to ""suck up"" to her can progress in their career.",Anonymous Employee,Current Employee,Singapore,"Feb 16, 2021"

Multiple projects were undertaken instead of focusing on 2-3 key pillars to tackle and undertake.

DBS definitely does have some structure and processes in place being a large Corp, but has some ways to go to improve staff mindset to grow out of a domestic company culture.","Upper Management in SME segment are top down, not responsive to feedback, treats the company like an SME. A lot of things are done specifically for PR purposes, instead of long term vision of what is good for the customer and company. 

Recent years have seen multiple reorgs of the IBG34 segment. 

The working style from the top of segment is non strategic and instant gratifying. Without C suite expectation of digitalization and that being put in the score card, some things would not have happened. Multiple projects were undertaken instead of focusing on 2-3 key pillars to tackle and undertake.

HR is no use. I think HR needs to take  training first then organize training for us. They are doing only one thing - flattering the senior leader so that they can get promoted ( which hapens always) this company doesnt derseve good people.

 I will tell you about something even worse. this company tells that they have great culture but it is one of those which has failed to trust its own employees. my wife was admitted and I kept on running after  their official insurance partner to get my own money. you can imagine how miserable it is when your company doesn't event bother about your feedback. 


 HR keeps on collecting feedback but nothing changes,  niether will their insurance partners change, nor the rest - onlly their employees will leave for which they dont care. HR will keep proving that insuramce company is good.

Not asking the bank to pay everyone equally, but to at least ensure competitive pay for TOP performers. However this seems to be too much for them as they value their MAs/GEs like precious gold.

3400,1,Not as prestigious as you might think,"1) You're working in the 'world's best bank'.
2) You can call yourself a banker.
3) Staff benefits are terrific.","Wow.. Where do I start?

If you're joining as a ""Wealth Planning Manager"", and believe that you're getting a prestigious job (particularly after those IQ tests they put you through online), you're drinking the kool-aid. Anyone with half the average IQ can get in. If you're holding a good university degree, please don't waste your time and seek better professions elsewhere.
In this role, there are only two things you can do day in and day out. Cold call people, and convince them to purchase insurance products. If you're not an insurance specialist, you get the added privilege of selling housing loans and unit trusts. Don't kid yourself with the idea that you're helping people - 99% of WPMs are doing it for the commission, so do ahead and employ dirty tricks to get that money. (Don't quote me on this.)
Management is a hit or miss depending on where you are deployed to. Managers are former top sales WPMs. That's the only criteria aside from having your boss favour you. You're blessed if you have any form of capable mentorship to help you excel at your role. Expect long work hours cold-calling people. Does not stimulate me.
That said, depending on your colleagues around you, work environment is fantastic. Expect some sexism, homophobia and racial ignorance, but that's pretty typical.

Backend operations is completely incompetent. Try to get in touch with any operation support team and face a dead end. Lack of seamless communication within their own internal structure makes processes more complicated than they should be.

If you are keen on joining, think hard and long about the career path you wish to attain. Ensure that you have a transferable skillset should you opt out of banking/insurance sales, or stay on and hope you make it to management. Even after all that I have said, the possible career progression is still decent.",Wealth Planning Manager,Former Employee,,"Apr 9, 2019"

Colleagues are very nice people, they will go extra to help out.","1. Applying for leave at the call center department is very difficult and there is an unwritten rule that it is frowned upon. Managers will write people up for even taking sick leave which is unethical and ridiculous. 

2. Most team managers  only cares about meeting their own metrices, they don't care about the well being of their reports. If you are lucky you will get assigned to a good TM, otherwise your time there will be frustrating. 

3. If you do overtime it will be compensated as off in lieu. The catch is that it is so hard to get off, you might as well give them free OT. There are people trying to utilize their off in lieu for months but their requests are rejected with dumb reasons such as not able to take post shift off for pm shifts. 

4. Same problem for the rest of your leave. Birthday time off etc. since it is next to impossible to get them. 

5. Systems are unreliable and will fail at least 2 times every month but you are expected to get on without them. The back up system is useless and you cant access  the important files in the intranet you need for references. Any mistakes that you make even when systems are down is on you and will become part of your performance report.

Depending on how you deal with stress and management, the workload will drown you. Phones ring non-stop. You're going to be told off by nasty customers almost everyday. Liaising with other business units for follow up replies is tedious. KPI updated hourly so it depends on how you take it. Every second plays into your KPI - how fast you answer the call, the actual call time, after call time, personal break (only 10 mins a day) and every second/minute that exceeds your break. Very steep learning curve, especially when you're on more splits than your seniors. If you're on chat - prepare for concurrent chats. Customers be it on chat or phone - are usually there to complain or demand for something ridiculous. When cases are escalated, managers tend to give in to them which made whatever you initially told customers REDUNDANT because you could have done it yourself but no - not according to terms and conditions. As they develop apps, campaigns and platforms frequently, there are always new issues. Turnover rate is high and with good reason - understaffed, high MC rates thus more workload for everyone else.

5. Systems are unreliable and will fail at least 2 times every month but you are expected to get on without them. The back up system is useless and you cant access  the important files in the intranet you need for references.

strong top management, weak mid management and unbalance ground staff. initiatives from top management makes sense and seems genuine in creating a good workplace and dependable bank. however, mid management either lack that foresight or are too busy in proving themselves that initiatives being cascaded down with very little effort in thoughts for the people on the ground. a team setup for a certain purpose is quickly overlooked about its objectives and overloaded due to poor management and planning. 
too many grey areas, archaic processes and systems. management too concern with pushing issues away and hover along the grey areas rather than embrace changes and acknowledge that its for the greater good to see every department as 1 bank rather than separate units.
mid management are too busy with proving themselves and giving results with no concern to staff. they take everything on and just throw it downwards with no deep understanding on how they want things to work. they only want to see the end results. when feedback on said issues, they only know how to ask for numbers and stats. extremely narrow minded.
lots of trainings and lofty ideas but none ive attended shows true reflection of management understanding what the real life is on the ground. when issues are brought up during trainings, trainers shrug and say speak to your manager. when you speak to your manager, they tell you not to get them in trouble. sure, CEO had invited people to contact him directly. but how many people are willing to disregard their livelihood and perhaps managers with good working relationships and contact the CEO directly.",Senior Associate,Current Employee,Singapore,"Nov 19, 2014"
