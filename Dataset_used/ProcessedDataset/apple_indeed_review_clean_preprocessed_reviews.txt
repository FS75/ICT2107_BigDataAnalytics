apple tende ad assumere tante persone senza discriminazioni eo limiti di et tendenzialmente verso l inizio dell estate il tutto per avere persone che aiutino nelle vendite degli iphone settembre e con le vendite natalizie per questo motivo nuovi assunti tempo determinato sono soprannominati natalini apple chiara assume per tempo determinato e pochissime sono le opportunit di rimanere anzi nulle per sono assunti su un totale di l ambiente lavorativo bello e stimolante tutto luccica e si vede che la sua base proprio americana proprio per questo motivo una volta che si inizia lavorare si ha una pressione immensa sul rendimento e rating ogni impiegato apple ha un proprio punteggio un rating basato sulle vendite e recensioni degli utenti ad ogni scontrino al di sotto di stelle la recensione negativa e il lavoratore preso di mira lavorare nelle vendite stressante ed anche nell assistenza apple rigida sempre si incentiva la vendita piuttosto che riparazione sicuramente un esperienza da fare apre le porte verso altre aziende per non rimanete meglio la vostra salute mentale

ho lavorato come specialist part time ore ad apple firenze ed stata un esperienza che mi ha cambiato la vita sono uno studente universitario e ho sempre pensato che la mia carriera fosse gi scritta interno del mio percorso di studi lavorando apple ho ripensato tutto l attenzione per il dipendente per il cliente il lavoro di squadra il team che si crea interno dell ambiente di lavoro unico e stimolante con un ottima retribuzione e agevolazioni per dipendenti e non solo turni mai troppo lunghi con orari sempre rispettati ed extra festivit e domeniche maggiorate non stato facile inizio entrare nell ottica di apple e fidarsi di un ambiente che durante la formazione ti prometteva tanto arrivati alle vendite e affiancati dai colleghi pi esperti si subito vista la stoffa dell azienda numero uno al mondo consiglio chiunque di provare candidarsi perch un esperienza unica sotto tutti punti di vista
azienda che si presenta da sola senza dubbio il posto migliore per cui abbia mai lavorato stipendi pi alti della media la collaborazione la chiave della loro filosofia chiedono tanto danno altrettanto

ho lavorato per apple retail italia per circa tre mesi nella posizione di technical specialist il ritmo di lavoro era frenetico soprattuto se lavori al genius bar hai pochissime pause e devi sempre mostrare il sorriso anche se sei una giornata spesso ti trovavi dover inventarti delle bugie ai clienti per il quale il loro dispositivo non funzionava ed manager ti pressavano tantissimo per offrire vari servizi apple ai clienti il lavoro presenteva varie problematiche di livello tecnico e molte di esse non erano neanche state approfondite durante il training che si tratta principalmente di test fatti online per cui spesso ti ritrovi con lacqua alla gola senza un vero e proprio supporto ho fatto tanti lavori nella mia vita unesperienza terribile come questa non lho mai avuta vivevo nellansia perenne e con una mania di perfezionismo che trapelava da ogni muro e soprattutto attenzione quello che dici perch il nonnismo ad altissimi livelli sono stato cliente apple per diversi anni non mi sarei mai immaginato cosa si celasse dietro alle quinte prima era unazienda al quale interessava veramente il cliente adesso sono una grossa macchina per fare soldi e faranno di tutto per ottenersi ogni singolo centesimo alla fine della giornata io sono estremamente contento di non essere entrato tempo pieno nellazienda non si allineava con miei valori ed era una grossa facciata un posto di lavoro dovrebbe far brillare le tue qualit e metterti proprio agio e non sentirti troppo sotto pressione limpegno sempre e comunque
