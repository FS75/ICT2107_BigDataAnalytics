het een super leuk jong en dynamisch bedrijf gezellige sfeer met door groei mogelijkheden een dag bij netflix hard werken maar ook veel plezier maken met elkaar toen ik hier kwam werken ik geen ervaring de call center wel heb ik jaar de horeca gewerkt en heb ik verschillende productieadministratieve stages gehad ik heb geleerd hoe ik klanten een fijn gevoel aan de telefoon kan geven en een gesprek gaande te houden de mensen die hier werken zijn het algemeen jong leergierig en gezellig de een wilt door groeien naar teamleader en een ander vind het prima om call agent te blijven maar iedereen kan het met elkaar vinden en niemand geeft een ander het gevoel dat hijzij minder waardig het moeilijkste om mensen soms een nee te moeten verkopen de zin van het bij ons momenteel niet mogelijk om verder nog iets voor u te doen tijdelijk er een storing waar niets aan gedaan kan worden en natuurlijk hoop je dat de klanten daar begrip voor hebben maar dat niet altijd het geval het leukste dat je veel kunt lachen en genieten met collegas en dat er toch nog een onderscheid tussen wie manager teamleader agent
boa empresa para trabalhar e crescer pessoalmente exige bom atendimento mas devido ao grande fluxo de atendimento n estava sendo possivel momento
