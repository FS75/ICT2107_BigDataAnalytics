2,Great IT Opps for people based in their Central Munich Office,nan,Their IT roadmap and solutions are amazing Really good in house systems eagerness to embrace new tech and some very bright people,If you dont speak German then you are left out of meetings where you are not the lead or directly required to action an item English is meant to be the corporate language but this doesn’t appear to be the case for IT as they freely talk German in meetings and on calls and only occasionally translate the odd subject when they think you will need to work on it Your opportunities for progression are nonexistent if not based in Munich or Villach and the relocation package offered is nowhere near enough if you have small children in education If you dont fall into the above cats then i would guess this could be a really good company to work for,Anonymous Employee,Former Employee,nan,20/01/2017

5,The best place I have worked,nan,Infineon has talented people with down to earth attitudes Everyone in the company is approachable especially senior management The company has a strong team ethic devoted to high quality and innovation It is surprising how supportive and respectful they are Their style is partnering not parenting The company is financially secure and virtually debt free Their salary structure appears to be competitive The best perk is the paid bonus incentive plan which is based on company performance It has been paid out at over 100 for the last 10 years This is unusal They work at attracting and fostering talent Employees stay a long time Many employees are in the 10 15 year range,More access to training from mid management and below,nan,Current Employee,nan,04/02/2012
4,Very satisfied happy to work in this company,nan,Friendly environment good share and gain of knowledge respect and support from all the levels of the hierarchy fair potential for personal growth The company is literally at the edge of the technology and gives you a lot of opportunities to learn and become successful in the fields you want A continuously growing company continuously changing based on the flow,Lack of motivation if you are not self motivated then nobody will push you to the correct direction for your personal growth You have to do it by yourself The fact that the company is in a leading position of the technology sometimes leads to a stressful environment Not all colleagues are qualified to work that fast or under stress or willing to work a bit harder,Verification Engineer,Current Employee,Linz,28/02/2018
2,Troubled HR department makes for poor work atmosphere,nan,The best parts about working at infineon are probably the amount of time off emplyees get However this applies to a lot of companies in germany and austria as well Tons of paid vacation and a pretty flexible schedule allow for a lot of personal freedoms other companies may not offer,Poor managment too many managers too few options for career opportunities poor grading system by HR HR is probably my biggest complaint since they seem to do so little for their employees Even if its not the case they are not making it look any different This leads to a lot of unhappy employees,IT Specialist,Current Employee,Klagenfurt am Wörthersee,01/09/2008
3,A fairly structured work environment,nan,A processoriented work environment has its pros in aspects of effectiveness doing the right things traceability and perhaps quality The company has good learning development program for its employees but it also depends on the managers decision to approve hisher employees course applications,On the contrary overly processdriven may stifle efficiency doing things in the best possible manner with the least waste of time and effort curiosity and creativity The work environment does not distinctly prevail an open and transparent culture,Anonymous Employee,Former Employee,Singapore,02/06/2017
1,Working here is like navigating a maze,nan,Quite a lot of competitors so technology and products move fast giving people great learning and collaboration opportunities Steep learning curve allows brilliant people to really shine Plenty of crosssite learning communities that allow you to really build your skills Freshers have a great opportunity to gain tremendous knowledge in the first few years of working,Your daily routine consists of coming up with ways with blame someone for every small delay rather than give you time to focus on work The blaming culture is a bit too extreme to the point that it can get sickening Managers will jump 10 feet in the air if there is an email asking why there is a delay Enough to give everyone hypertension Very poor work life balance you are informally expected to work round the clock including answering emails on the weekends Not a healthy sign when communication on email is replaced by whatsapp messages especially when youre on the way to work in the morning,Engineer,Current Employee,Singapore,29/04/2020
3,Work for 10 years in IFMY,nan,Benefits so far so good people are good as long as you never poked their back or go against their will career advancement are consider ok,politics here and there till the management also play the same game Bias on the vendors selection not healthy for the overall organizations the HR hiring policies never side the internal people for internal transfer they always think the outsider are better and hired with better package reorganization is normal here almost every 2 years big and 12 year small but it always disappoint the people as the organization changed never really focus on the problem just for the sake of change only,Staff Engineer,Current Employee,Melaka,22/02/2016
5,good place to work for work life balance,nan,good respect towards employees Willing to send engineers for overseas exposure no micro management if at kallang sector the work enivronment is good above average benefit relax atmosphere in germany benefits and management even better,still very german centric knowledgeknowhow still concentrate in germany management in germany still trust german engineers than singapore hence difficult to gain visibility many engineering methodologies used are not well known industrially hence knowhow learnt may not be transferable if u leave infineon if in singapore semiconductor equipment for FA limited it is more of a design centre good ic design and test engineers productFA engineering not so much scope product engineers seemed isolated from fab processes which should not be the case,Senior Product Engineer,Former Employee,Singapore,10/07/2010
4,Great and underestimated german hightech company,nan,Infineon former Siemens Semiconductors is one of the few genuine german hightech enterprises It offers jobs for highly motivated engineers in a very modern environment and is represented in may countries around the globe which offers great opportunities for intercultural collaboration Automotive and chipcard business units are doing quite well being market leaders in various segments,After separation of Qimonda the memory business which went bankrupt and Lantiq wireline communications and the transfer of the wireless business to Intel there is only little left from a formerly big enterprise which is kind of sad In some getting less areas there are remainders of typical german we never done it that way aka not invented here syndrom killing innovation ideas rather brutally,Principal Engineer,Former Employee,Neubiberg,10/09/2012
2,Great Environment Wonderful Colleagues and Terrible ManagersTeam Leaders,nan,Good benefits depending on your location and type of contract Healthy and positive work environment Great team spirit Excellent WorkLife Balance,Management is usually very incompetent and has no interpersonal skills whatsoever This is mostly due to the fact they are usually promoted on the basis of seniority and not merit or skill Even if you go the extra mile to achieve all your targets,Anonymous Employee,Current Employee,Porto Oporto,24/07/2019
4,Good company bad managers,nan,Good benefits as working from home in certain circumstances Good for working students as they provide leaves to perform exams and it doesnt have influence on your salary except for meal allowance of course Great office space with relaxing and play areas Started to get too crowded for lunch,Poor management style Lack of decisions making Everything was theoretical and in practice the management errors are never assumed and all the blame is always on the employees of lower level Some managers showed to much respect towards certain employees,Supplier Master Data Trainee,Former Employee,Porto Oporto,24/05/2019
3,Insider Observations on Infineon global and Infineon Singapore,nan,Singapore Initially I have the strong impression of joining one of the leading German engineering company with solid engineering process knowhow structure etc Being a German company unless the company is facing a crisis they try to keep people employed and avoid even pay cuts,Singapore Being as a offshore site it faces quite similar challenges with other MNC companies not being the HQ Although Singapore is the APAC HQ there is very little benefit in my mind Unless you have fluent German somehow there is still the language barrier Culturally this companys traits are no trust in what you do until you have proven yourself in the what and how So be prepared to start off establishing these for some years In terms of benefits it is quite poor No profit sharing No stock option or RSU very basic health insurance for only the employee family you have to pay 1k plus every year extra Work wise to be brutally honest because of the strong workers union in Germany a lot of the workload is thrown over to offshore sites If you compare the workload of a similar job role my experience is doing 2x the load and 12 the pay In short offshore sites get squeezed Another downside of the culture here is that majority of employees at least 80 do not have sense of ownership of what they do and no sense of urgency They need to have many project managers to push them and a lot of these poor project managers have to fight with other project managers for resource of up to 01 man months The rootcause of this is the appraisal system the rating here is A exceed to D do not meet both A and D are EXTREMELY hard to achieve So why will employees want to put in the extra And the poor project managers are squeezed by management for not delivering while they do not have the empowerment to set appraisals for these people Line managers on the other hand get away by pushing responsibilities to the project manager being the nice managers to the team and pushing the bad guy role to the project manager Oh by the way promotions are seriously RELATIONSHIP first and then others like skillset experience and competence So long as you are NOT a German forget about holding senior positions or high responsibilities I saw a case where a new hire with master degree with couple of years of experience is put as a project manager who is a German Instead of giving this other other more experienced project managers in the offshore And as expected this project manager who has no technical handson skills is calling the shots on microcontrollers that are going into your BMWs Audis Mercedes etc even the basic companies have a pantry with drinks and biscuits Here you have to pay using vending machines And biscuits come one in 2 weeks and if you dont take it its gone,Engineer,Current Employee,Singapore,07/05/2020
2,Watchout compensation should not be the only criterion for a good work place,nan,Infineon has a very good compensation package There is some flexibility about your working hours Because of its location ITPL it takes time to reach here but the shuttle service is very good and comfortable ITPL also has lot of banks and billpay facilities So it is hasslefree to get anything done,PLease be informend that I am commenting only about Bangalore office and more so my particular group Bangalore office is very dependent on the HQ for direction In addition If you were planning to do some creative work you can forget about it Quality of the employees is not very high either,Senior Software Engineer,Current Employee,Bangalore,01/10/2008
2,Engineer,nan,Descent salary Free Non veg lunch,Every exit door within the building has swipe out access Even to go to reception area we need to swipe out even though its official duty and this time is minused from 9 hrs thats mandatory to stay in office Feels like we are locked in a 10storied building Swipe out even to breathe fresh air outside for two minutes No breakfast Even if you want to pay and buy no stalls available Only a small kiosk that sells maggi,Anonymous Employee,Current Employee,nan,29/10/2017
