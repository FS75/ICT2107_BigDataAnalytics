5,Love working at Meta,I’ve been at Meta previously Facebook for a few years overall love it My team is very close supportive I’ve been able to learn a ton and really grow into the role Meta is a high performance culture so I constantly feel pushed to be better which has been good for my growth but it can lead to some long weeks mentally tiring The compensation is very generous compared to my previous role outside of tech The only con is that the org can be very political as is true for most big companies which leads to frustration as we’ve grown benefits have started to shift Overall though the company puts a lot of investment in helping its employees feel fulfilled in their role if you focus on impact your work will be rewarded,nan,nan,Manager,Current Employee,Austin TX,7/4/2022
3,Innovative company but suffers from some chaos,I am in a nontech role at Meta It is exciting to be at the forefront of some exciting new innovations in the tech space but the companys structure or lack thereof leads to a bit of frustrating chaos that could benefit from a leader early on rather than the bottomup development thats common now Otherwise the people are great and the amenities and benefits are hard to beat I pay very little for health care and can have all three meals for free if I am in the office The atmosphere is also flexible with coming in versus working at home though this may be teamdependent The performance review system leaves a lot to be desired there is a lot of pressure to make measurable impact and some roles just dont function that way and are more reactive,Free meals flexibility,A lot of fire drills in nontech roles,Policy Manager,Current Employee,United States,2/4/2022

4,Lasseizfaire position wonderful community competitive team environment,I have really taken a liking to this position after having worked as a Brand Influencer for 4 months My efforts do not go unnoticed during our frequent team meetings and although infrequent there are incentives that spice things up for us sales reps paired with an energetic and attentive manager there is a strong drive for many of us to be the absolute best and it shows in how fast product comes and goes at locations with vs without BIs Your participation at your location is on you to be accountable for so planning your day and meeting personal goals is my best way of keeping myself on track Also to note that there are extensive trainings required and optional for all employees to perform this job correctly and effectively Overall Ive found this to be the most rewarding position Ive ever worked and Id highly suggest it to anyone interested in media and marketing,nan,nan,Brand Representative,Current Employee,Albany NY,27/02/2022

1,Malevolent Smoke and Mirrors,My FB org hired extremely overqualified employees to create a neverending dog and pony show I cannot stress this enough the work itself was almost entirely meaningless and they knew it The emphasis was on projecting the illusion to higher leadership that the org was useful and worthy of additional resources Information provided during the hiring process including job responsibilities and potential transfer advancement and location options proved to be untrue Management had no shame when it came to establishing unrealistic expectations and could quickly devolve into pettiness if called out for it Honest feedback was never welcomed only compliance We were expected to smile and be pleasant at all times regardless of how much unimpactful work was heaped upon us and often demanded urgently I was told at one point this is tech where everyone fakes it until they make it which I found disgusting and untrue Tech did not get to where it is today by only pretending to offer value The horrible performance review process required employees and managers to rate one another not anonymously and a certain number of workers were required to fail regardless of performance The managers would formally gather to argue over which employees could meet expectations which equated to rewarding employees with a reputation for being smiley and compliant Mentioning or trying to fix problems aka innovating painted a target on workers backs The amount of bureaucracy inflexibility inefficiency and substandard software was shocking for a tech company The mixed messaging,nan,nan,Analyst Programmer,Former Employee,Menlo Park CA,22/07/2020
3,Elitist Culture,This is a data driven culture that doesnt understand that data can be bent or skewed to drive a specific initiative Its a good place to work but you definitely need to have eyes in the back of your head because people at this company will take advantage of kind people for their own benefit Speaking loud interrupting others and showing aggression is often rewarded at this company,nan,nan,Manager,Former Employee,Menlo Park CA,10/7/2020

2,Great pay but at a huge mental cost,Wonderful pay and perks Some pretty cool projects and smart people but your mileage will vary depending on which team youre on Some teams are great others not so great Lots of ego and toxic bully behavior triggered by their stack ranking performance evaluations so everyone is competing against peers They literally encourage people to talk behind peoples backs its called providing peer feedback Sometimes it goes out of hand because management sucks on average They promote people with zero people skills zero problem solving skills zero team building skills and empathy to managers Really it takes more than taking your team out for lunch once in a while to call yourself a manager Diversity is a PR stunt only they hire you for the stats they boast about their diversity programs all while dont care about retention rates they keep those secret They really are a whiteboysunder25 club I heard reports of people doing drugs to outperform peers and win the rat race towards a raise One of my peers used to send pull requests at 2 am on a regular basis All in all a great company but each team has its own little microculture that may be toxic and you may be stuck I joined for the company left because of a manager,nan,nan,Software Developer,Former Employee,Seattle WA,13/04/2020
