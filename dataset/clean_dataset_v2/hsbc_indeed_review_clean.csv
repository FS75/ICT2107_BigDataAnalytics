1,No one steering the ship,promotion nonexistence in the US performance not aligned with pay focus too much on what direction instead of how to get there Methodology of ways of working clashes with old ways of thinking muddling in a quagmire of too many processes to effectively accomplish anything efficiently Pay and compensation do not align with ones skills proficiency or acuity for what they were hired for Promotion of illqualified persons Constant reorganization leading disorganization Leadership listens but does not hear Pros Plenty of soft skill and technical training options Culturally diverse,nan,nan,Virtualization Engineer,Former Employee,Buffalo NY,30/03/2022

1,Good Benefits Terrible Management Work Life Balance,Review is based on HBMY Contact Centre Like the subject Good benefits in terms of Insurance Under AIA 30 Annual Leave Aside from these two points nothing good I could think off 1 Management will I emphasized again WILL work you like a horse 2 If you are an Active COVID person you will not WILL NOT be getting an off day They WILL force you to work They asked their employee to get MC even though it is physically impossible to get one if you are infected with COVID 3 They have this strategy to get rid of underperforming employee which due to accumulated stress from how harsh they treat you by putting you under performance review pressuring you and eventually coerce you to resign ive seen this happen to a lot of Department Managers and Assistant Managers who couldnt support this type of management quitting 4 You are just a number to HSBC HBMY People seniors who have serve this company for 1020 years quitting due to how the current management is treating them Do not make the mistake of applying to HSBC HBMY,nan,nan,Global Banking Executive,Current Employee,Sepang,21/03/2022

2,Not a stable work environment Frequent Reorgs I find they struggle with their identity and who their customer focus should be,Poor management Promoted people with no experience in the area which I worked Some managers were not afraid to make it known they did not like you even though your performance was above average Was place into a hostile work environment and HR did nothing even when they heard how the manager spoke to employees Would really encourage that the interviewee ask questions on the work environment Also reorgs every 2 3 years with massive layoffs of 30k worldwide,nan,nan,VP Sr Manager Relationship Management,Former Employee,Buffalo NY,11/03/2022

4,Experience very much depends on business area,Had I wrote this review on the back of my experience working in HSBC branches it would have reflected significantly more negatively However what I will say is working in the HSBC contact centre is a much more positive experience with plenty of opportunities to grow and learn and an advocacy for a healthy work life balance in a flexible approach The managers in HSBC contact centre are much more approachable and professional than those that are in branch so if you are looking for a role in HSBC my advice would be to avoid branch based roles and look for something more remote such as contact centre or head office,nan,nan,Team Manager,Current Employee,Remote,09/03/2022
5,Best place to work,Very good company to work with They emphasize on work life balance The company takes care of the wellfare of the employee Honesty is the number 1 policy of the company,nan,nan,Customer Service Representative,Current Employee,Alabang,09/03/2022

2,Good experience for graduates,Cons Understaffed undertrained outdated laggy legacy system poor management rude entitled customers unrealistic “targets” positive customer survey Pros holidaysick pay bonuses at discretion of managers Good experience for recent graduates My advice would be to do a qualification eg DipFS CeMap CII IMC etc sidebyside Because opportunities to move up in HSBC are scarce especially in the retail part of the business I Plan to stay in my position as a UB no more than eighteen months,nan,nan,Universal Banker,Current Employee,London,07/03/2022
3,Hard to accomplish anything,Your experience will depend on where are you in the bank its so huge If youre lucky youll be able to learn a lot but you can also end up learning little if you arent in the right place Politics rules meritocracy hardly existent Its rather difficult to deliver anything as the organisation tends to run in circles or follow a step forward with 2 steps backwards,nan,nan,nan,Current Employee,London UK,06/03/2022

2,Internal recruitment process,I am writing this as an employee who is being made redundant at HSBC I would like to start by saying that although the compensation is quite a bit below the market average the benefits offered are very good especially the pension The culture in HSBC is spot on and the company are very focussed on staff wellbeing with management very supportive However if you’re trying to apply for a job internally this is where the company seems to treat people extremely badly Prior to being placed at risk of redundancy I applied for and was successful for an internal position I was interviewed and got told that I had been successful Four months later I was made aware of my start date after months and months of constantly chasing the recruitment team In my period of notice of redundancy I applied for a role internally and it took them two months after repeatedly chasing them for an answer to tell me I was unsuccessful I’m now a few weeks away from redundancy and I’m still waiting to hear if I am successful for another position I had a second interview for a time ago I don’t know why it takes so long to tell someone if they are successful for a job they applied for but it seems to be a policy as a number of others have stated they have had the same experience The interviewers both knew I was being made redundant yet the company seems to think this is an ok way to treat staff who are in this position It’s absolutely shameful and actually very nasty,nan,nan,Anonymous,Former Employee,United Kingdom,03/03/2022
5,Productive diverse and fun workplace,Ive worked in a fastpaced environment whit a big team around 200 people I had the opportunity to learn a lot in these years at HSBC the company helped me to grow and I worked hard to give back all the investment and trust placed in my work I was lucky to have great mentors and I tried to learn the best of them With an important focus on cultural diversity HSBC has always been at the forefront of creating multicultural and sustainable workplace environments,nan,nan,Operations Coordinator,Former Employee,São Paulo Brazil,02/03/2022

3,Depends which areadepartment you work in,Worked in an office firstly with no contact with customers only with branch staff solicitors Was enjoyable job bit repetitive but good team spirit Pay was very low for duties performed so transferred to branch network in order to work nearer home cut commuting costs Big mistake Branch atmosphere very different not very friendly at times Tremendous pressure to sell products to customers who just wanted to pay money into their accounts or discuss money troubles,nan,nan,Securities Clerk Customer Service Representative,Former Employee,Cardiff City Centre Cardiff Cowbridge,28/02/2022
3,People are great and historically a great culture,Severe lack of management lack of investment in staff iro automation skills development Management are blinded by cost cutting above all else to the detriment of retention of key experienced staff knowledge wishing the organisation All junior roles are already or are being offshored so no new talent coming through the junior ranks other than by hiring in people at AD level and above from other banks Problem being the best staff don’t join as comp doesn’t come close to matching Tier1 salaries so invariably 2nd tier staff are brought in…,nan,nan,Regulatory Reporting Accountant UK Operational Accounting Contract,Former Employee,8CS,27/02/2022

5,Lots of opportunities to advance if you apply yourself,I retired from HSBC after 35 years and worked in various branch positions and eventually managed several teams in AML Compliance Advancement and day to day success depends A lot on your manager So you need to be flexible in the way u do things and adjust to changes Overall a very good place to work,nan,nan,Vice President AML Compliance officer,Former Employee,New York NY,22/02/2022

1,Wouldn’t recommend,It was great when I foraged joined as it was a great opportunity once I completed university It helped with learning about my role and how I could use that knowledge elsewhere I wouldn’t recommend for the simple fact that you need to know someone to know someone that can help you get ahead on the company if they don’t like you or care for you it’s a wrap and you’ll be miserable They don’t care how they treat staff and the bank itself is a hole,nan,nan,Universal Banker Role,Current Employee,London Greater London,15/02/2022

1,Avoid branch level at all costs,HSBC has been consolidating and eliminating retail banking branch services for the past few years Now a branch is only staffed by 2 tellers at all times and its both stressful for the teller and the customers Micromanaging and bureaucracy is rampant amongst branch staff You will feel like youre a high school student getting chewed out by the higher ups everyday,nan,nan,Personal Banker,Former Employee,Vancouver BC,03/02/2022

1,Used to be great but now its awful,I worked for HSBC for nearly 8 years and saw it really go down hill in the last 2 Theyre so focused on improving their score CMA score and getting everyone to do things digitally that theyve closed nearly every counter service in every branch Also the process to setupreset digital banking is so long and complex most people head into the branches for that reason At least half the managers in the UK branches were made redundant at the start of 2021 with loads of branch staff soon leaving as there was not enough staff to fill vacancies and the work just piled up Booking holidays is frustrating as you need to book them in September for the following year Last I heard from my old branch was that 15 people had left including myself between Jan 2020 and Jan 2022 with only 3 being hired to replace them,nan,nan,Back Office Support,Former Employee,Nottingham,02/02/2022

3,Customer service rep role,Felt like a robot taking one call after the next and call stats are heavily monitored What I hated was the fact that it was hard to take ownership of calls because the role involves following flow charts during the calls For example if the enquiry was about a lost card you couldnt just ask if the card has been stolen and say you will deactivate the card and send out a new one You would have to look at the script on the screen and ask a question depending on their response you would click on the appropriate answer shown on the screen which takes you to the next promptquestion and then continue until you get to the end of the flow chart You would fail calls if you did not ask the questions in the right order and click on the correct answer to take you to the next step customers would get really annoyed as even if a questionanswer was really obvious from what the customer has said to you you still have to follow the process of clicking on the right part of the screen As a result the customers felt quite belittled So really you dont learn anything about banking because you are just reading from a screen Certain phrases had to be read out every single time and you could not bypass this otherwise its a regulatory failure Customers werent impressed at being read out the same phrases again and againyes they had to listen to these disclosures every single time they did something as simple as makinf a transfer Its monotonous and hard to motivate yourself when you cant free style the call and be yourself,nan,nan,Commercial banking customer associate,Former Employee,Leicester,06/10/2021
