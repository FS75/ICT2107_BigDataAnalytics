50,The best place I have worked,,Infineon has talented people with down to earth attitudes Everyone in the company is approachable especially senior management The company has a strong team ethic devoted to high quality and innovation It is surprising how supportive and respectful they are Their style is partnering not parenting The company is financially secure and virtually debt free Their salary structure appears to be competitive The best perk is the paid bonus incentive plan which is based on company performance It has been paid out at over 100 for the last 10 years This is unusal They work at attracting and fostering talent Employees stay a long time Many employees are in the 10 15 year range,More access to training from mid management and below,nan,Current Employee,nan,Feb 4 2012

20,Troubled HR department makes for poor work atmosphere,,The best parts about working at infineon are probably the amount of time off emplyees get However this applies to a lot of companies in germany and austria as well Tons of paid vacation and a pretty flexible schedule allow for a lot of personal freedoms other companies may not offer,Poor managment too many managers too few options for career opportunities poor grading system by HR HR is probably my biggest complaint since they seem to do so little for their employees Even if its not the case they are not making it look any different This leads to a lot of unhappy employees,IT Specialist,Current Employee,Klagenfurt am Wörthersee,Sep 1 2008
30,A fairly structured work environment,,A processoriented work environment has its pros in aspects of effectiveness doing the right things traceability and perhaps quality The company has good learning development program for its employees but it also depends on the managers decision to approve hisher employees course applications,On the contrary overly processdriven may stifle efficiency doing things in the best possible manner with the least waste of time and effort curiosity and creativity The work environment does not distinctly prevail an open and transparent culture,Anonymous Employee,Former Employee,Singapore,Jun 2 2017
10,Working here is like navigating a maze,,Quite a lot of competitors so technology and products move fast giving people great learning and collaboration opportunities Steep learning curve allows brilliant people to really shine Plenty of crosssite learning communities that allow you to really build your skills Freshers have a great opportunity to gain tremendous knowledge in the first few years of working,Your daily routine consists of coming up with ways with blame someone for every small delay rather than give you time to focus on work The blaming culture is a bit too extreme to the point that it can get sickening Managers will jump 10 feet in the air if there is an email asking why there is a delay Enough to give everyone hypertension Very poor work life balance you are informally expected to work round the clock including answering emails on the weekends Not a healthy sign when communication on email is replaced by whatsapp messages especially when youre on the way to work in the morning,Engineer,Current Employee,Singapore,Apr 29 2020

20,Great Environment Wonderful Colleagues and Terrible ManagersTeam Leaders,,Good benefits depending on your location and type of contract Healthy and positive work environment Great team spirit Excellent WorkLife Balance,Management is usually very incompetent and has no interpersonal skills whatsoever This is mostly due to the fact they are usually promoted on the basis of seniority and not merit or skill Even if you go the extra mile to achieve all your targets,Anonymous Employee,Current Employee,Porto Oporto,Jul 24 2019

30,Insider Observations on Infineon global and Infineon Singapore,,Singapore Initially I have the strong impression of joining one of the leading German engineering company with solid engineering process knowhow structure etc Being a German company unless the company is facing a crisis they try to keep people employed and avoid even pay cuts,Singapore Being as a offshore site it faces quite similar challenges with other MNC companies not being the HQ Although Singapore is the APAC HQ there is very little benefit in my mind Unless you have fluent German somehow there is still the language barrier Culturally this companys traits are no trust in what you do until you have proven yourself in the what and how So be prepared to start off establishing these for some years In terms of benefits it is quite poor No profit sharing No stock option or RSU very basic health insurance for only the employee family you have to pay 1k plus every year extra Work wise to be brutally honest because of the strong workers union in Germany a lot of the workload is thrown over to offshore sites If you compare the workload of a similar job role my experience is doing 2x the load and 12 the pay In short offshore sites get squeezed Another downside of the culture here is that majority of employees at least 80 do not have sense of ownership of what they do and no sense of urgency They need to have many project managers to push them and a lot of these poor project managers have to fight with other project managers for resource of up to 01 man months The rootcause of this is the appraisal system the rating here is A exceed to D do not meet both A and D are EXTREMELY hard to achieve So why will employees want to put in the extra And the poor project managers are squeezed by management for not delivering while they do not have the empowerment to set appraisals for these people Line managers on the other hand get away by pushing responsibilities to the project manager being the nice managers to the team and pushing the bad guy role to the project manager Oh by the way promotions are seriously RELATIONSHIP first and then others like skillset experience and competence So long as you are NOT a German forget about holding senior positions or high responsibilities I saw a case where a new hire with master degree with couple of years of experience is put as a project manager who is a German Instead of giving this other other more experienced project managers in the offshore And as expected this project manager who has no technical handson skills is calling the shots on microcontrollers that are going into your BMWs Audis Mercedes etc even the basic companies have a pantry with drinks and biscuits Here you have to pay using vending machines And biscuits come one in 2 weeks and if you dont take it its gone,Engineer,Current Employee,Singapore,May 7 2020
20,Watchout compensation should not be the only criterion for a good work place,,Infineon has a very good compensation package There is some flexibility about your working hours Because of its location ITPL it takes time to reach here but the shuttle service is very good and comfortable ITPL also has lot of banks and billpay facilities So it is hasslefree to get anything done,PLease be informend that I am commenting only about Bangalore office and more so my particular group Bangalore office is very dependent on the HQ for direction In addition If you were planning to do some creative work you can forget about it Quality of the employees is not very high either,Senior Software Engineer,Current Employee,Bangalore,Oct 1 2008
