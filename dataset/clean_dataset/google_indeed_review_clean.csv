50,Overall great company smart people and great benefits,WFH at the moment with the option to go into the office Good amount of time with clients but way too many internal meetings Self promotion and side projects are keys to success not necessarily your day to day tasks Many opportunities to learn and network and you can fill that in with other trainings on diversity and personal growth Culture varies by team but for the most part everyone is friendly and willing to help Total opposite of cutthroat However that also breeds some complacency Hardest part of the job sometimes is staying motivated because theres little incentive to keep pushing at times Loads of filler meetings where nothing gets accomplished Best part is worklife balance benefits and team culture Worst part is upleveling your position in the company management track is nonexistent the promotion process only getting harder and longer for long time Googlers and the inability to obtain more money no room to ask for a raise as its all done algorithmically and even in sales its fairly difficult to blow your quota out of the water albeit you will usually hit your goals or come close,nan,nan,Account Executive,Current Employee,New York NY,October 19 2021

40,Great experience even as a contractor,I love working at Google If you get a chance to work here definitely do it Whether you come in as a contractor or a permanent employee you definitely will get the experience of a lifetime With that being said I do feel like contractors known as TVCs are treated differently I still think there is an overall great culture but I wish they gave TVCs some of the resources they give permanent employees Part of the reason Im open to other opportunities is that there really isnt a clear path to conversion the line is pretty blurred Not to mention you have to reinterview for it Google loves people that thrive in ambiguity but as a TVC its a little concerning when you dont have much guidance on how to push for conversion You are essentially doing the exact same job as permanent employees but apart from good numbers they want to see other intangibles to really have a strong case for conversion Some of the top performers on my team were TVCs but unfortunately are not at Google anymore because they didnt make it through the conversion process Would I take this job as a TVC again Probably I admire this company and love how much you grow as a professional I am definitely still gonna give the conversion process a shot but Im also realistic and know I need to be keeping my options open,nan,nan,Sourcing Recruiter,Current Employee,Austin TX,February 11 2019
