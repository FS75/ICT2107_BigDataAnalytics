20,average experience with shady staff members,,location it was close to home,shift timing it was based on an 8hour work shift so morning 8am4pm afternoon 12pm8pm and evening 3pm11pm Plus we only had one day off per week which was insane for a parttime job and the contract was three months long but many left the job after a week Racial discrimination on the first day I met my colleagues who were Malay Our supervisor was a Chinese middleaged woman and she assigned them to the temperature screening station which was literally our job scope and separated me from the rest She spoke to me in mandarin and asked me if I was Chinese Im Indonesian Chinese and then said that I should do work that can benefit me and gain some skills along the way implying that the temp screening job was for nobrainers My new job was at the selfcheckout counter where she ensured me that I could work my way up to cashiering but it was not what I wanted Plus when they took me off of that station because I was underage and couldnt sell people alcohol cigs etc inconvenient the Chinese ladies at that station were denigrating me and mocked my situation Really fun working environment Anyways I hated that job and the environment Left after a month because I needed cash,Part Time Temperature Screener,Former Employee,Choa Chu Kang New Town,Feb 19 2023

10,Horrible Treatment,,I really wish I can have something to say about this,Too many I am being very serious about this matter I would like to share my parttime experience at Fairprice Ang Mo Kio Branch This is actually to elaborate on the mistreatment of part time staff behind closed doors So I actually was hired through a recruitment agency online The advertisement for the part time job states the timing to be 7am to 3pm 3pm to 10pm The job description was “Event Roadshow Helper” Prior to accepting the job I called up the agent to understand more I specifically mentioned that I will not want a cashiering job because I am not experienced and that I do not wish to make compensation for any cashiering mistakes The agent told me that the event helper will probably have some light cashiering on the roadshow area orand some stockup items on rack at the roadshow area With that I accepted the offer On the first day of work I was assigned to a fullon cashiering job at the main counter not that of the roadshow area The part timers were told that we are supposed to come at least 15 minutes earlier to count our float money and get briefing which will not be payable The shift starts from 9am to 5pm not as per the advertiment post with a break time of 45 minutes starting at 3pm We are all blamed rudely for not preparing our own pen for work despite there was no prior instruction I believe that if the stationery is needed for work it should be provided by the company I was assigned under a senior cashier We both went to one main counter and the queue never stopped None of us part timers were given any prior cashiering training So we are tagged to a senior cashier for the first day to learn as we work There are actually many promotional items that needed to be memorised and it is not automated inside the scanning system or printed in hardcopies for cashier to remember So any mistake made or shortage of cash beyond 5 will be payable by the cashier During my lunch break I was instructed to go into the office with the cashbox after logging off I was told to count my money and make necessary calculations to prepare for the float amount for tomorrow The float amount should total up to 600 but it has to consist very specifically how many numbers of 10 notes 5 notes 2 notes and so on coins included So it took around 10 minutes to count and we have to do it because 3pm is one of the timeslot to make exchanges with the chief cashiers We also have to queue up at the chief cashier counter to exchange our money at 3pm So if you can imagined every cashier who have a lunch break at 3pm will be waiting in queue to make necessary exchanges This will take up around 5 minutes We are told to be back 10 minutes earlier for our break Hence the real break time is around 20 minutes That is not quite sufficient to buy a proper meal and consume We are also instructed by the chief cashiers to not pack any food into the office There is no selfinitiative on my end that I can make this break time situation better The chief cashiers are extremely rude to parttimers and also the senior staff as well They are bullies They exercise their ranks to intimate those who report to them and they never teach us anything They held the seniors responsible for all the parttimers despite it is their manpower management issue to begin with The senior I was assigned to is a responsible hardworking staff who worked for many years But it is unreasonable to expect her to coach me efficiently if the queue is never stopping And I was only “coach” for one day and I was on my own the second day Every morning the chief cashiers will brief the cashiers in a rush They will show many promotional items over a small computer screen They will not be printing any hardcopies of these items for the cashiers They will warn every cashier that it is our responsibilities to memorise these items Specifically one chief cashier warned us not to ring the bell to ask her for help despite this is part of her job to assist the cashiers at the counter should it be necessary She warned us that we have to bear the consequences of any mistakes for these promotional items It is nearing Hari Raya and the items are easily more than 4050 products on different sales packages discounts promotional cards date duration of items There is no way a person can remember all these details in a short briefing of less than 5minutes The chief cashier also shouts rudely many times at parttimers and fulltimers exercising a bullying culture across the whole department For example on one cashier briefing the chief cashier asked if any cashier was not on duty yesterday and my senior was signalling to me that I need to tell her I was not on duty yesterday and the chief cashier shouted at my senior who is a good and responsible staff and has worked for over 7 years “KEEP QUIET” This is unacceptable and no human being should be treated in this manner Even if a person makes a mistake this is still not how a managing personnel should be dealing with it The chief cashiers are extremely rude to the staff They will shout and scold us for every little mistake or if they simply feel so For example I was serving a customer at the counter and when there is a specific music that plays at over the speaker at fixed timings it is actually a signal for counter cashiers to wipe the counter tops So the chief cashier was waiting impatiently for me to make that cleaning so she can snap a photo My senior whispered to me to clean the counter so I took the cloth and wipe for the chief casher to snap the photo The chief cashier immediately walked over and scolded me in front of the customer saying that I should serve him first I am very confused why I was scolded I simply followed the instructions Then right after I took the cloth and wipe but I need to know if she has snapped the photo So I looked up and she shouted again “WIPE Do not look up at me” On the second day I was on my own at a cashier counter I was barely trained The queue never stopped My agent told me I cannot get my salary if I did not serve my notice but I have still decided to go because there is a very high chance I would make a mistake with all the promotional items which will be bearable by my own pocket Despite voicing out to the manager that I wanted to change to a jobscope the request was rejected at the reason that NTUC can assign their parttimers however they deem fit although this is not inside the contract I signed This is absolutely unfair to me because this was not told by my recruitment agency I did explain the miscommunication but it is not accepted or discussed by the NTUC manager at all,Cashier,Former Employee,nan,Jul 7 2022
