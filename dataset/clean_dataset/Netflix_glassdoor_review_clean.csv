50,Freedom and Responsibility,,Diversity Inclusion Representation Flow Good,Sometimes you get to hung up on one thing,SWE Intern,Current Employee,Los Angeles CA,Mar 27 2023
30,How much does a functioning human cost,,Paycheck So many good people Such a great service Hope,I have been working for a year at Netflix Ive seen what was supposed to be very mature people sharing absolutely almost no contact that anyone would qualify as human Sure that sounds hyperbolic let me develop and maybe cherrypick a little Have you heard about our culture The one about giving candid feedback I have seen people complaining of behavior they literally demonstrated themselves in the following days But I have also seen these feedbacks resulting in tears both in the eyes of HR persons or fellow engineers How human does that sound Have you heard about our culture The one about not tolerating brilliant jerks I have nonetheless seen angriness and frustration expressed in private public and meeting People rejecting new ideas by default like any ideas they wouldnt have worked themselves on for days wouldnt count Even if those ideas are from the best examples in the industry or academics How many publicationscontributions have you seen from Netflix to computer science in general How does it compare against any other company of that size in the Bay Area Can you imagine either the real insecurity xor the lack of innovation that could lead to this situation Except for a few managers directors or VPs feeling free enough to behave at work in the same way than how they live almost every engineer I have been interacting with have shared as little as possible about their private life The rare exceptions of interpersonal exchange ends up around some sort of competitive behavior Who is the most geeky sportive owns the fastest carbiggest housevisited the strangest place Ive heard workaholic people complaining about ambitious peers who were overmanaging overworking to get even more work to do after I feel like were past workaholism at this point Maybe there are a lot of shy people Maybe there is a culture of fear not only of being fired but also a fear of interacting with people going to be fired Maybe its all in my head maybe people giving 5 stars to their experience here dont care the human aspect of a company And maybe theyre right What about your crush your fears your desires for the future your appetite for life Ive been blessed to work in enough large companies to know that the behavior that Im seeing in Netflix is not a healthy one Ive also been lucky enough to work in other industries more socializing than tech and I can tell that Netflix has a lot to do on that side and offsites or team meeting wont solve that problem I am afraid about the tragic but inevitable consequences of the ways people operate in this company I guess that the day the worst will happen it will be addressed in an impersonal memo by Reed followedup by 1 or 2 reminders during offsites Possibly commented by HR in a QA document And move on This company seems as reactive in its management of people as it is proactive in its business operations I still work at Netflix though not only for the paycheck but because I hope I hope it will change The needed change cant happen from a candid feedback a QA or only from inside Change has to come from everyone including people who take time to read comments like this one Netflix has so many good people and offers such a great service As a curious Netflix employee reading this review think about your past isnt there a big human thing that you would love to feel again in your current company that youve felt in the past As a candidate think about what would be a good question to ask to that HR partner once your package is almost here to be offered to you think about that comment you make at the end of an interview when youre being asked by an engineer Do you have any question for me What Netflix needs is an inception something that anyone and everyone would think about after leaving the call or the room they were sharing with you Ask yourself and then the others the question you should ask if you think you want to spend a good amount of your life and energy in the place youre applying for Will I learn and contribute to the knowledge of others Even outside the company Will I see emotional responses from my peers Will that be for other reasons than being fired or bluntly criticized Will I find a friendly environment that will nurture my appetite for life What is the amount of emotional interaction celebrating sharing playing to expect from a company whose service is the best to entertain Do androids dream of electric sheep,Anonymous Employee,Current Employee,nan,Sep 20 2018
50,high performing environment fantastic benefits trust and results earn a lot of freedom,,great benefits best salary around beautiful offices and you will work amongst some of the smartest folks you have ever met plus you are talking about tv and movies all day its a FUN job,the company has grown rapidly over the last few years and during covid the previous way of onboarding and building trust was much harder to achieve I was at Netflix new many growth phases and this one is definitely the hardest there are a ton of talent people in the marketing department that have been there a long time eg more than 4 years but not a lot of upward mobility so it feels like folks are getting restless It has also become a much more political environment where it feels like leadership is most focused on decision making based on perception vs what is best for the work and the teams If you are a used to a political environment this may not bother you,Marketing Director,Former Employee,Los Angeles CA,Jan 30 2023
30,Netflix is not for everybody,,The best part about Netflix is that they try to pay 20 more than everybody else so the compensation is good They are not shy about spending money so travel is business class youll get a new MacBook Pro every year etc The people there tend to be very nice the catered lunch is delicious and so forth While there is still a lot of action in Los Gatos building the technology although arguably it is becoming mature as streaming is a commodity the real drama is in Los Angeles relating to content,Netflix has very strange politics because peoples jobs are at the whim of their manager In other words if a manager decides that a particular report is no longer a star he or she will get a package So given that employees are not stupid there is a lot of kissing up resulting in a lot of comedy Netflix believes in 360 feedback but everybody I know only does that to their peers and they become very political with their management chain,Senior Software Engineer,Current Employee,Los Gatos CA,May 22 2019
40,Still a great company but losing its magic,,Netflix is unlike any other company Ive worked at Theres a level of trust that you dont see at other companies and the people you work with all tend to be seniorlevel and very capable Because of that there hasnt been a hierarchy among ICs everyone leads projects and functions as a trusting peer with everyone else Its also always been a pretty lean company with process where its needed but not the influence of politics and bureaucracy But both of those are slowly changing and I fear it will soon become like every other tech company Another pro is that the compensation is 100 salary no bonuses or forced RSUs and thankfully thats not changing,Inconsistency in management across the company the addition of levels among ICs could hinder collaboration as not everyone will be equals and a hierarchy will be created the possible introduction of a locationbased salary adjustment is unjustified output stays the same the company saves money with so many working remotely Internal communication has been horrible lately which is sad and frustrating for a company that prides itself on being open and transparent,Product Designer,Current Employee,nan,Nov 20 2022

20,Highly Political Company with Mediocre MiddleManagement,,The pay when all engineers were senior engineers was higher than most other companies Most coworkers in the earlier Cloud days were great engineers and extremely helpful,There is a great deal of politics between Engineering orgs and even within engineering teams Even with obviously outstanding performance failing to play politics well will leave you unrewarded while others with more political savvy will be rewarded for no work at all Ultimately the manager is free to be biased foragainst employees for any reason at all Engineering managers in some orgs tend to be nontechnicalonly doing project management Although some nontechnical managers might still be good managers there are some that are horrible with poor project management skills and that dont even know what is happening in their own team Those managers tend to be employed at Netflix for many years There is no career development support here Its unlikely that the current management will do any more as new lower engineering levels are added As for the 360 review its best to avoid giving significant negative feedback as it makes coworkers defensive Everyone is afraid of anything negative that can lead to them being fired HR and management advice on 360 reviews is unrealistic and selfserving It only helps management since some managers dont know whats happening on their own teams Ultimately Netflix is a large company where experiences will differ depending on which team and organization you work in If you change teams or managers a few times though youll encounter highly toxic situations For new midlevel prospective employees avoid Netflix since the lower pay is likely not worth the extreme politics and toxicity,Senior Software Engineer,Former Employee,nan,Jun 30 2022

50,Best company culture Ive experienced,,The company culture was extremely empowering as an employee I really felt like I was listened to and had the freedom to do what I felt was best for the business Knowing that management wanted employees at every level to understand the long and short term business strategies so that they could themselves make the best decisions for the business was extremely empowering this kind of transparency is rare in companies Coworkers were really smart and passionate about what they did Management was self reflective and introspective The company was constantly innovating and looking for ways to improve so you never felt like you were sitting still Perks and compensation were also the best Ive experienced in my career,Due to rapid growth over the 4 years I was there perhaps a little bit of the culture was lost or watered down mostly in terms of feeling like you perhaps knew fewer people as the company grew No opportunities to work remote when I moved out of state I would have loved to have continued to work for Netflix at the same time I understand why they dont want remote employees,Senior Software Engineer,Former Employee,Los Gatos CA,Apr 2 2017

50,I work for a company that changed the way Americans rent movies,,Netflix is populated by really smart people working on hard problems The company is on innovation time all the time Its a very open culture with no questions asked if you work from home or take days off People love Netflix and that makes it cool to work here The company is adding subscribers and growing financially which you gotta love in this economy Employees get a free eightout plan and get 1000 towards travel expenses to the Sundance or LA Film Festival You structure your salary as you want dedicating a percentage or none at all to stock options You get all your salary up front so theres no bonuses or incentive payments during the year,You dont get a lot of compliments on a job well done because everyone is supposed to work at A level The salary review is not tied to the performance review Performance review allows anyone in the company to evaluate anyone and many people do it anonymously which can be vindictive The stock rises and falls like a yoyo Everyone is supposed to work in cubes but some people have had offices built for themselves or taken over a conference room for an office There is two distinctive cultures at Netflix Ones in Los Gatos and the others in LA The only time people come together is at quarterly directors meetings,Vice President,Current Employee,Los Gatos CA,Jan 1 2009

20,Frenzied environment that feels like a cult,,Great pay cool office great perks Everything you want is already in the building Many smart people come through the org but many don’t last long because of the culture,As a team leader you are immediately tasked with acclimating quickly to a vary “culty” type culture You need to use the proper vernacular and Netflix language making sure to give and take hard feedback and that is the currency internally You will immediately be pressured to apply the “Keeper Test” to evaluate your team and if you don’t let someone go quickly Like within weeks you’re likely to be perceived as weak The workload is frenzied There are so many titles launching that there is very little time to be truly strategic on the approach unless you’re working on one of the big blockbuster titles,Anonymous Employee,Former Employee,Los Angeles CA,Mar 28 2019
40,Netflix hires the best and brightest but realize that you are hired for one job and vertical movement is unlikely,,They hire great hardworking people and the management is relentless and single focused in enforcing their mission statement and driving success in DVD rental by mail and online Everyone who works there is of above average intelligence and ability and the jobs can be rewarding and demanding They really do hire people who are autonomous and can own a process and you can rely on those around you to provide the support you need,They do not focus on career development and would prefer to hire someone from the outside to be your boss or replace you rather than groom you to grow into a more senior position There are a couple of core values that they preach but do not really follow through on There is a very different culture between the LA office and the HQ which feels inconsistent with their value system,Manager,Current Employee,Beverly Hills CA,May 13 2009
10,Fearbased culture,,Higher than market salary Free lunches Unlimited PTO,Fearbased highly competitive culture driven by upper management Midmanagement is forced to follow the suit otherwise it will be their job on the line Everyone is under pressure to deliver but nobody provides guidance as to what is expected If youre a superstar youre supposed to figure it out on your own Zero tolerance to even small mistakes youre expected to work as a perfect robot If you made a mistake youre out immediately no chance for correction Zero communications about your performance it is all up to management to decide how youre doing So you dont know whether you made or making mistakes Project management does not exist hence no planning is happening just loose email exchanges You dont feel as part of the team there are virtually no teams just people trying to prove something and keep their jobs As a result many decisions are shortsited since they provide immediate credit longterm decisions are usually on backburner until all of a sudden they become critical and then it is all hands on deck Youre expected to work long hours and weekends on regular basis Basically if you accepted an offer youre owned by Netflix Documentation is nonexistent people are secretive about knowledge transfer All in all Netflixs motto Freedom comes with Responsibility turns into the situation when company has freedom to do whatever it wants and employees have all responsibilities,Senior Software Engineer,Former Employee,Los Gatos CA,Jul 5 2010
10,Salary 15 above market Duration of employment 90 below market Worst culture to work in,,You get paid 15 above market rate I was making 165k in my last company 150k base 1520 bonus in a stress free environment and then one fine day i found an opening at netflix which suited my profile applied gave the interview and they offered my 180k total like a fool i jumped onboard lost my job after 9 months and now back in the market and yes those 9 months were no less than delivering a baby,just after joining i realized that the guy sitting right next to me was fired few weeks ago as i spent more time i realized most of the people around me were no more than an yr old the work was too much but i thought they are paying me more so i worked hard at it turns out i had 2 slight disagreements with a member in another team and bammm i was gone the company has a very simple philosophyif things are not 100 perfect fire and hire rinse and repeat dont make the mistake i madedont leave your stress free environment for 1015k etc because you going to end up being fired the moment your performance falls below 100,Senior Software Engineer,Former Employee,Los Gatos CA,May 8 2012

10,Churn and burn,,Some great people there fellow employees,Every call you get can result in a survey with either a yes or no if they were satisfied with Netflix You can get anywhere from 40 to 120 calls a day and the survey feedback was instant meaning as soon as the caller input their survey you were notified 2 Nos could wipe out a whole day of Yess and a lot these callers were incredibly unstable Anything from people not remembering their password to the website to death threats You had just 4 minutes to try to make them happy somehow and get them off the line before you got an instant message asking what the problem was If you had to many Nos you get fired on the spot Call time too long Fired People came and went so much I didnt want to get to know them well because I knew theyd be out the door shortly I had an incredible team coach that had a lot of faith in me which allowed me to persist in this enviorment When the whole separate dvd shipping and online streaming failed they fired him and many many others I hung around for 9 months before I quit the pressure to make metrics was savage and it was estimated that only 5 of the employees would make it to a full year I could go on with situations where the customer was extremely abusive said no to the survey and went way way over the 4 minutes I was allowed only to have my job threatened for not meeting metrics but hopefully you get the idea,Call Center Support Staff,Former Employee,Portland OR,Oct 31 2013
50,Best company culture Ive experienced,,The company culture was extremely empowering as an employee I really felt like I was listened to and had the freedom to do what I felt was best for the business Knowing that management wanted employees at every level to understand the long and short term business strategies so that they could themselves make the best decisions for the business was extremely empowering this kind of transparency is rare in companies Coworkers were really smart and passionate about what they did Management was self reflective and introspective The company was constantly innovating and looking for ways to improve so you never felt like you were sitting still Perks and compensation were also the best Ive experienced in my career,Due to rapid growth over the 4 years I was there perhaps a little bit of the culture was lost or watered down mostly in terms of feeling like you perhaps knew fewer people as the company grew No opportunities to work remote when I moved out of state I would have loved to have continued to work for Netflix at the same time I understand why they dont want remote employees,Senior Software Engineer,Former Employee,Los Gatos CA,Apr 2 2017

50,Honestly couldnt imagine working somewhere else,,Extremely competent colleagues Fastpaced Incredibly transparent The culture is amazing Benefits are amazing Everyone here wants to do a good job Management is being serious about diversity and it shows in their hiring Were given incredibly autonomy to execute how we see best Ive never even heard of a company that gives individual contributors such autonomy I bet if we decided to build a spacecraft we could pivot and have an MVP in orbit by the end of 2017 Its also pretty neat to work for a movie studio basically Certainly much different than most companies in the Valley,Its a little far down in the South Bay Los Gatos but theres a shuttle from SF Deadlines can be intense and you really have to be an advocate for your time If youre not an assertive person or cant learn to be then you will probably be overworked here,Senior Software Engineer,Current Employee,Los Gatos CA,Sep 24 2016

10,Culture of fearand possibly loathing,,Relative to some Bay Area companies Netflix pays about 10 to 20 better Meaning if youre unqualified youll get better pay than someone who is more qualified doing the same job in another Bay Area company Altho I hear this is changing and Netflix will only give you a raise if you can find someone in the Bay Area with the exact title and responsibilities who make more Contrary to the buzz about Netflix being a tech innovator its become a Hollywood company What drives Netflix is the Netflix produced shows not the innovative streaming technology Hollywood runs Netflix not Los Gatos,Since many people are only at Netflix for the higher than average salary there is a culture of fear whereby people are constantly worried about their employment status in the company and will unfortunately submit to their baser instincts to do whatever it takes to keep their job As for a highperforming culture I guess its relative but Ive worked with much much more talented people elsewhere Netflix is a great place if you are average and are able to keep upper management for figuring out that you are just average and are willing to do whatever it takes to keep up that facade Its a less than ideal place if you are truly innovative and want to do amazing new things Again the new thing at Netflix is producing new shows not technology,nan,Current Employee,nan,Feb 19 2014

10,Bait and switch,,I wasnt looking to change jobs Netflix found me and offered me a very generous salary and relocation to leave my employer I loved my job but it only lasted 4 months after they hired someone from another big company and he wanted to bring in his own team I was still in corporate housing when they let me go They said the new manager didnt have chemistry with me but I had only met with him twice and he had only been working there for two weeks before he decided to let me go over said chemistry The new guy was very unprofessional and treated me in ways that do not align with the Netflix culture I talked to the VP that hired me and he said he was very sorry and that I had done nothing wrong and didnt need to change a thing but that he had to support this other guy in his decision I wish things wouldve worked out different but I did enjoyed my time while there,You can be let go without warning based on very little substance to support it They have many reasons they can let you go but they never talk about the unjustified reasons Think twice about relocating for them,Anonymous Employee,Former Employee,nan,Jan 5 2016
20,Get in get experience get out,,You get to work on cool products and your salary is relatively high for your job title Also most people that you work with are relatively competent and smart,No growth potential they dont have a track and they dont put resources into grooming their employees Get the experience you need for a few years and move on to grow your career Also the culture of the Beverly Hills office is different than in Los Gatos This is largely due to management and the fact that the prevailing hiring and HR philosophies are not executed quite as they should be Although management is generally on the mark in letting people go there have been a few notable decisions that have not quite made sense The review process leaves much to be desired as it still does not accomplish the desired goal of identifying the rock stars and separating them from the lessproductive Also it is very common for employees to be expected to carry the workload of several people and action is usually only taken when something big ends up falling through the cracks,Manager,Former Employee,Beverly Hills CA,Jan 6 2009
50,The most rewarding environment,,Incredibly talented smart driven coworkers across every function of the organization Unusually organized and efficiently run Feel lucky if you get the opportunity to be part of such an amazing place and such an incredible time It is rare,New head of Talent is not the right person to be leading and shaping the culture of Netflix There are many concerns echoed about her throughout the company and worries that with her at the helm the sacred secret sauce will start to spoil,Director,Current Employee,Los Gatos CA,Jul 17 2013
30,Customer Service Is Not For Me,,Good pay benefits and relaxed atmosphere,Customer service in general For some reason going into this I did not think it would be a typical customer service experience based on my own satisfaction with Netflix for the past 3 years Its pretty easy work but so many people who called were lazy andor arrogant jerks Some of them made me feel like I was an inch tall It was emotionally draining especially for someone as sensitive as I am The pressure to meet the 0 DSAT also didnt help The survey asks about the company but its answer is a reflection of the customer service and high DSATs effect job performance Were expected to convey a relaxed friendly attitude and build a personal rapport with the customer but with pressure of the DSAT its hard not to make everything sound forced and phony because you want to really turn it on to try get a yes out of the person Im an introvert so faking conversations and trying to think of chitchat was hard for me Do not take this job if youre sensitive and dont have strong conversational skills You must get to know the person It is required I also wanted to add that the schedules and team leaders are constantly changing Its extremely frustrating,Customer Service Representative,Former Employee,Frisco TX,Apr 7 2013
50,Best place to work for great engineers,,Its like working for a very well funded startup If youre good this company will boost your career lightyears ahead Compensation and perks are just right No lavish lunches just good organic food to keep you focused on business No laundry service Its not taking over your life Very fast growing company Lots of room to grow and lots of opportunity if you look Visibility top down you see everything There are no secrets in this company Very helpful if you know how to use this to your advantage,If youre not good you wont survive here If you have issues with your people skills you wont survive here If you need handholding someone to constantly point you in the right direction youll be directed to the door while holding your hand Youll have to manage your worklife balance Some people just dont know what unlimited vacation means,Senior Software Engineer,Current Employee,Los Gatos CA,Oct 29 2013
40,Great product great company great culture with a few kinks,,Total freedom to do outstanding work if you are up to the task Great coworkers and colloberative environment to supply the best entertainment possible anywhere any time all over the world,Having that freedom to excel comes the same freedom for everybody else including your boss If they just dont like you they have the freedom to fire you without any buy in from anybody else They have complete freedom to do so without any solid justification no matter how good everybody else thinks you are Hence frequent shock when people hear so and so got fired when everybody that worked with them thought they were a rock star This is setting the seed for large scale office politics,Director,Former Employee,Los Gatos CA,May 31 2017
40,Great place if you are a great employee,,Netflix is such an amazing company with clear goals and values Everything is upfront from day one I can understand many of the negative reviews and that is becasue it is not for everyone Netflix is staffed with great people and those that are not so great get terminated Since they hire the best and pay well they are paying you to be the best The entire company is very open with communication and treats you like the responsible adult you should be You will know where you stand at all times and what you need to work on Freedom and responsibility is self governing there is no one looking over your shoulder making sure you are doing your job or tracking how many days off you take If you get the job done and do it well you are fine and dont need to worry,There is a lot of pressure to always be at peak performance If you think youre great and you strive to be the best in everything you do I would highly recommend working here because you have the opportunity to have a huge impact on the business If you are just looking for a job that you can secure and coast this is not the place,nan,Current Employee,Los Gatos CA,Aug 25 2009
40,Amazing culture clear and transparent strategy and an amazing staff,,The company has amazing work culture They encourage personal responsibility so youre allowed to work the way you like to work as long as work is getting done All teams appear to be very clear and transparent with regards to strategy I knew exa,Lack of new employee onboarding for your particular role When youre new everyone is really busy so there is rarely time for you to sit down with someone and learn the processes for your role that are specific to Netflix A lot of it is learning on the,Anonymous Employee,Current Employee,Beverly Hills CA,Dec 10 2014
50,A culture of high performance can be daunting for some but worth it,,High performance environment youre given a huge amount of responsibility and ownership to drive your work Youre able to see the direct impact youre making to the company as a result The company is incredibly transparent everyone in the company no matter the level could tell you our business direction Stunning colleagues High bar for hiring so youre working amongst smart driven and passionate folks,Highperformance environment expectations are high and you run fullspeed most of the time Not the right kind of environment for everyone,Anonymous Employee,Current Employee,Los Gatos CA,Jul 26 2016
50,Talent,,The interview process at Netflix was extremely enjoyable I felt respected inspired and appreciated by all of the interviewers I spoke with The process took 3 weeks in total and they were extremely accommodating when I shared that I had other offers I was considering within a deadline I decided Netflix was the company I wanted to work for because of that great candidate experience during the interview process highly intelligent people I interacted with along the way unique and inspiring culture perspective and opportunity for my career The culture at Netflix is like no other it is a supportive environment where the best people can really grow challenge one another and bring new ideas to fruition I am encouraged to share my experiences opinions feedback whenever possible and as a result you feel extremely valued as an employee I look forward to coming in to work everyday and being surrounded by stunning colleagues,I really dont have any cons,Anonymous Employee,Current Employee,nan,Nov 7 2017
50,Best place Ive ever worked,,Freedom and Responsibility rings mostly true although youd have to be stupid to not realize it isnt 100 true always and in everything Simple indisputable example you cant decide how much you make yourself Thats an obvious statement yet it proves there definitely are nogoes and as such gray areas In practice it hasnt been an issue for mejust clarifying You want X number of monitors Y superamazingcomputer come in at 11am leave at 4pm take numerous vacations ask and receive a real answer dang near anything about what moviesshows theyre secretly bidding on in Hollywood etc etc Not only things a reasonable person would want to dohave more like a well spoiled person This all assumes you are communicating this with your team and performing well above averageNetflix does not knowingly hire junior midlevel or wannabesenior engineers I havent personally seen a bunch of people get fired but of the one or two Ive seen it was not surprising I have noticed some teams are more critical of performance than others Like any company of a decent size not every team has exactly the same culture Mine was absolutely wonderful daytoday My managers help you and coordinate more than manage me which is huge just by itself To this point most engineering managers I know of arent really programmers which I think is a huge bonus because there is far less risk of them wanting to micromanage projects and implementation details That said they are ALL very very technical and can fairly trivially smell BS Salary youll be more than happy as far as Ive heard from coworkers For me they made it impossible for me to ever even consider leaving because of salary Almost every place Ive worked prior I had at some point felt underpaid Not here I felt very much appreciated and paid as such Summary YMMV like in every big company but seriously thats super important to understand but my experience was amazing and by far the best place Ive ever worked all things considered I left for personal reasons that arent related to Netflixwifefamily stuff,If youre not a high performer but you manage to sneak in the fear of being canned could certainly be real since YOU WILL inevitably be discovered But dont second guess yourself It should be obvious whether or not you are a high performer Sometimes discussions on the Freedom and Responsibility culture turns sort of cultlike With a select number of people questioning its realworld implications has been met with very clear disgust almost denial Very rare though For me was trivial to brush off,Anonymous Employee,Former Employee,nan,Aug 17 2015
50,My 2 Years at Netflix,,I just hit my 2 year mark at Netflix and it has been great thus far It has been quite the whirlwind and learning experience and I continue to be challenged every day The partnerships I have formed are immeasurable and to be involved with a company changing the way entertainment content is consumed is pretty exciting Biggest pro in my eyes to working here has been the people My colleagues truly are stunning as the culture deck highlights Really some of the best in the business and everyone I collaborate with has a clear passion and drive for their work Although we move at lightning speed it pushes me to excel and not simply coast through the day to day grind,Sometimes we forget to celebraterecognize our major accomplishments because we are always moving towards the next best thing,nan,Current Employee,Los Gatos CA,Oct 15 2015
10,It’s about fear and not about culture,,Salary higher than the rest of the industry,Culture of fear Indoctrination into a culture that is focused on intimidation and unattainable aspirations The company grew so quickly that rightfit managers for a startup are now managing large numbers of people and they are incompetent Due to this incompetence the culture has become cutthroat where many people have been rapidly fired without justification Often it’s political because their management fears the person being fired would replace them Management is dishonest about the “transparency” of salaries and raises where favorites are rewarded rather than those who actually perform The higher people are in levels of management the greater the pressure to give up all personal life including family and children Successful executives are dysfunctional with no personal lives The culture memo or “deck” is a deceitful document now It’s become weaponized and is used to humiliate people and fire them There is no warning before being fired It’s a surprise process where people are often told they are no longer employed and told to leave the building immediately Management then communicates a fabricated version widespread to many employees by email or meetings often stating that there were repeated coaching and warnings There is none,Manager,Former Employee,Hollywood CA,May 22 2020
20,Needs a lot of improvement,,Great benefits great dental awesome Co workers and theyve put a good bit of money on making the cafeteria and building nice,Well where to start Management all have different expectatiins and different styles You can be the star of one team switch teams and be given warnings No one Is in the same page Their attendance policy is not followed well by management Or Hr I was told I could take a day off by Hr after a certain date with no issue So a few days after the date I was given I took the day off that I desperately needed and was fired next day No prior warnings or attendance issues Hr gave me the OK and then are the ones that fired me I think that days a lot about how well this place rubs,nan,Former Employee,nan,Sep 13 2016
40,Best people around,,Working at Netflix feels a little like working at a startup You are given a lot of freedom depending on where you work to improve things as you see them There is a free snack bar and fridges full of drinks on all floors and buildings if thats important to you Very laid back on what time you come and go as long as it doesnt impact your results and they will not tolerate brilliant people around if they are jerks also Socially you will make a lot of new friends and dont be surprised if they ask you to join outside of work for weekend BBQs etc,Being results and data driven sometimes causes higherups to try different strategies and they will often change their minds and direction This leads to inefficiencies and frustrations While they officially have a take as long vacation as you like policy some people were let go a few weeks after coming back from taking their first vacation in years,nan,Former Employee,Los Gatos CA,Sep 22 2015
10,Intense,,Perks salary and benefits Did I say salary,Endless meetings and intense feeling of constant termination,Manager,Former Employee,Los Angeles CA,Sep 24 2020
40,Growth and evolution,,Company moves fast and you can be very productive Minimal bureaucracy Generally good at attempting to disseminate vision from topdown Strong technical contributors and great peers Most policies and practices are employeefriendly in that theres little impediments to getting stuff done Company does get rid of lowperformers regularly,As with many rapidly growing organizations theres some chaos and politicallybiased positioning during the changes Some managers are focused too tactically on product today not strengthening the team and products for future If you need to work at a place where things dont change much or where you can know youll be employed for yearsthis is not the place for you Work load can be heavy at times but the work itself is interesting and fun,Anonymous Employee,Current Employee,Los Gatos CA,Mar 6 2015
20,Most of the negative reviews on this site are accurate,,Better than average pay Unlimited vacation Free lunch and snacks,No upward mobility Frequent restructuring Cliquishness Netflix makes no secret about its high performance culture which results in a very high turnover Average life expectancy in this office is about 2 years which means very often the main knowledge base of a department exists when an employee is terminated not always for fair reasons or chooses to leave since there is no room to grow There are conflicting values and many managers dont practice what Netflix preaches If you associate with the right people this can help your career but it is disappointing that office politics factors so heavily into a company that preaches how different they are from other corporate cultures Yes its great we all get Blackberries or iPhones and are reachable 247 and have a liberal vacation policy but the aura of paranoia that invades the office due to the frequent restructurings is not conducive to successful business practices,nan,Current Employee,Beverly Hills CA,Feb 1 2010
20,Was once a Superstar now very much adrift,,Fairly New Technology Smart Talent Free food and iphones This place will certainly wow you in technology and some of the best talent Good compensation,lousy vacation policyget real no vacation policy no vacation very stressful work environment little to no career opportunities if you are hired as an engineer Chaos everywhere High Turnover always affects your work one way or the other,Senior Software Engineer,Current Employee,Los Gatos CA,Aug 8 2013
30,Changing Values,,Fellow customer service employeesmanagement are great great pay and KILLER benefits Cafe is subsidized which makes fresh healthy food very cheap,When the center first opened there was a very employeefocused vibe and it created a comfortable positive space while we still did our jobs While the center is still miles better than your average call center theres been a big shift to being numbers and metric focused something we were promised from day 1 of the center opening would not happen often at the expense of employees and floor support Theres a major disconnect between HRWFM and what actually happens on the floor and often we are given no context as to why decisions negatively impacting us are made The center here in SLC has also stopped promoting people internally a majority if not all of the supervisors in the last several months were hired externally This is another example of changing values at Netflix rather than giving current well qualified employees opportunity for growth they hire people unfamiliar with the process and product which further impacts the floor negatively,Customer Service Representative II,Current Employee,Salt Lake City UT,Mar 30 2016
40,Work there at your own risk for a short period,,Pay perks and Great resume buffer as well,Terrifying with anxiety 247 While working at Netflix it feels like you’re trying to survive rather than thrive Your job is always on the line you can be let go at any point and people work in fear to the point that they expect to be let go,Executive Assistant,Former Employee,Los Angeles CA,Apr 1 2020
20,Quit before youre fired,,Netflix does have some great benefits They offer hourly employees a good starting wage the break room is stocked with snacks and employees receive a free Netflix plan As an exempt employee the wages are great much better than other companies The freedom to take time off as youd like is great its unlimited for exempt employees,If you accept a job at Netflix youll probably be pretty happy at first Youll feel liberated by how much freedom and responsibility youre given Youll be allowed to complete things without much as far as guidelines and youll be allowed to work from home if youd like However as soon as you complete something that someone doesnt like youll feel differently Your first mistake could easily be your last There arent second chances and no one is safe from being let go My advice to prospective Netflix employees have a savings and jump ship as soon as you can Its only a matter of time before youre asked to go to a conference room and find yourself starring at a red Netflix packet,nan,Former Employee,Hillsboro OR,Sep 1 2011
10,Senior software engineer,,Perks like free food unlimited vacations though a double edged sword really swag sometimes exciting projects and some good coworkers,Too much of hiring and firing As a result everyone is looking out only for their roles and jobs A lot of political crap Esp not good for single income families or H1B visa holders Ive had people cry when they are let go because they dont have any other options Take the good salary with the risk it gives You will be let go its just a matter of when Growth opportunities are nonexistent and your salary bumps are very subjective Work life balance is a joke at times but it depends on team and manager You cant have great work life balance for long since either your manager will be let go or you will be let go for not working harder Unlimited vacations are good in a good team but if your manager is a micromanager forget about it It then becomes worse than limited vacations,Senior Software Engineer,Current Employee,San Francisco CA,Jan 13 2019
40,Great company Super high performers and smart people,,Pay is great You work with highly motivated driven people that are all trying to be their best In my experience all peers are very willing to share best practices and help you be better as well Benefits are great and work life balance is a real thing Positivity is part of the culture which is infections If youve ever worked for a company where you see a peer not doing much and not being held accountable for driving success those type of people will not make it which in my book is great Accountability happens here Freedom to be you and manage with your own sense of style as long as you are managing within their values,Periodically you come across super competitive peers that may be stand offish for fear of sharing or getting to close to you because they want a position that you want That competition is fierce when applying for new roles but it doesnt describe the majority of the workforce Due to constantly challenging yourself and expectations to continue to be high performers you can leave mentally exhausted on a daily basis,Customer Service Supervisor,Current Employee,Salt Lake City UT,Aug 27 2016
40,Fast paced high performing high turnover engineeringfirst,,I really enjoyed my time at Netflix its a bold company to work for and you are surrounded by people who are passionate about what they do I always say the health of the company starts at the top and Reed Hastings is someone I highly respect as he can see through peoples BS and keeps those around him honest Hes the kind of person that will give you personal and professional advice even at an all hands with hundreds of people in attendance The work will feel like youre being thrown to the fire due to the culture of high performance and no subscribed process but if you know what youre doing and stay dedicated to your teams goals in a productive manner you should be fine,While there are incredibly bright and talented designers at Netflix I learned through my time there that this company was an engineeringfirst company I mean look at how long it took them to change the logo and get some design standards going Design often times felt like a luxury than a necessity and there was a bit too much dependency on AB testing to make decisions I swear I heard have we AB tested this yet in my dreams A few times I would point out that the results of the AB test resulted in bad design solutions It just seemed like upper management didnt understand design As long as people are watching content and streaming patterns are on the up then dont rock the boat Also watch out for those who play politics sometimes the drama that plays out on projects or team dynamics is just unreal and some people just want to be the hero and get Reed Hastings blessing Unfortunately there are some brilliant jerks in the company learn to work around them and get stuff done right Lastly if you want a more lifework balance this is probably not the place for you I had some coworkers who didnt see their kids for days,Senior User Experience Designer,Former Employee,Los Gatos CA,Mar 1 2017
50,Easily the best company to work for,,Managers tell you what needs to be done and why giving you the freedom to decide how to achieve the goals Deadlines are reasonable and rarely require late nights or weekends Very little process getting in the way of coding No junior enginee,It lacks some of the fun corporate secrets that Apple Google have The only thing that will grow is your salary No real opportunity for a biggerbetter title,Senior Software Engineer,Former Employee,Los Gatos CA,Sep 19 2019
50,The most satisfying place to be a rockstar contributor in Silicon Valley Not a place for anyone else,,Every role at the company is a chance to directly effect the success of the business The sense of ownership is big the challenges are big and the work is very engaging In my experience Netflix has an outstanding team of rockstars a very motivating group to get to be a part of and work with The culture puts high demands on everyone and imparts great freedom and ownership in return Very data driven customer focused innovation oriented,The company is very focused and so brand new areas and opportunities come rarely There are not a lot of arms and legs positions so most roles have both a handson and a strategic component to the work I wouldnt agree with a review that says long hours are expected but I do think amazing productivity and results are expected I view this as more good than bad but it can feel tough to measure up at times Promotion opportunities are rare but they do happen Most growth at the company comes as growth in ownership rather than in title,Vice President,Current Employee,Los Gatos CA,Apr 2 2009
20,Marketing,,They hire smart people The CEO is really wonderful Hes smart inspiring has a clear vision for the company and is transparent with the teams Looks great on your resume Great product with big ambitions Lunch is brought in everyday,The culture that they sell you in the interview process does not exist within the marketing department I do think it is strong within other teams in the organization particularly in engineering In marketing decisions come from the top down without clear context on goals why decisions are madeand why certain things are deemed successful while others are not Half of your job is socialization and seeking approvals with very little empowerment to drive things forward Lots of bureaucracy and politics and different perspectives are not valued,Senior Marketing Manager,Current Employee,Beverly Hills CA,Jun 4 2016
50,Really great place to work if its a culture fit,,My favorite thing about Netflix is being surrounded by a ridiculously talented group of people who are also fun to work with Management provides a clear compass about the priorities of the company and that makes it easy for teams to prioritize their projects appropriately The next few years are going to be really interesting with the company making the transition from a really good DVD by mail service to a great way to get movies by mail or over the internet,Netflix has a very strong defined culture and if you fit that culture its a fabulous place to work If the underlying philosophies dont mesh well with how you see the world it can be a painful place to work If youre thinking about taking a job at Netflix take time to investigate the culture fit I havent seen anyone be successful here if the culture fit is off,nan,Current Employee,Los Gatos CA,Nov 17 2008
50,A straighforward company who knows who they are and are not,,We are committed professionals who are passionate about creating a business that changes the entertainment landscape Employees make a difference results matter The business model is relatively simple but execution is very complex There are interesting problems to solve for everyone We arent afraid to try something new or to stop doing something that doesnt work,Management isnt sensitive The team noy family metaphore is true Perks are minimal but salaries are good Career pathing is owned by employees not management Its an opt in company and not for everyone If you are more comfortable with structure or guidance this might not be your kind of place,Chief Talent Officer,Current Employee,Los Gatos CA,Sep 3 2008
20,Inspiring company but culture is changing,,Pay is great and the company leadership are inspiring Youll likely have fun every single day From HR to finance to marketing everyone is on top of their game at a way Ive never seen in other companies,While the Silicon Valley culture seems true to form the Los Angeles office culture is falling apart and while everyone is whispering about it no one is surfacing the problem Its becoming a traditional Hollywood institution quickly and I found it extremely disappointing Heres a few issues that seem to be common 1 Little room for employees to grow beyond their current roles and swimlanes 2 The power distance between junior and senior employees in Hollywood functions has rapidly grown 3 Content teams are constantly at war with themselves and other functions 4 Title deflation is real,Anonymous Employee,Former Employee,Los Angeles CA,Sep 18 2017
20,Its like I go to prison 8 hours a day,,Health benefits are amazing the ability to customize your schedule works for me the pay is good for work performed free Netflix is a plus and the meals are cheap,There are a lot of perks working for NetflixCS but in my opinion its the worst job Ive ever had The calls are non stop and repetitive During training you are led to believe that numbers arent important but that isnt the reality Lower level management is very inconsistent Upper management Ive never experienced a problem with I have noticed that politics play a huge role in your success with this company Ive seen deserving people passed up on promotions The turnaround rate is obscene,Customer Service Representative,Current Employee,nan,Dec 19 2017
50,An incredible environment that will definitely make you grow as a professional,,I have worked for Netflix for 3 years As most of reviews say it is incredible to see how open and honest the culture is The company is still pretty flat for its size and you can feel your impact on initiatives you work on Development moves very fast and our cycles are short and iterative Multiple 6month long projects in other companies get out the door in a matter of a few weeks I definitely feel like reviews on Glassdoor do not make justice to the Netflix environment Yes there is a lot of work but I do not feel people get let go all the time or that anyone would feel scared of being fired without reason People do not get let go without fair warning Everyone I know that has been let go so far saw it coming and recognizes it is the best for both them and the company I find it hard to believe sometimes we have to overcome peoples fears in that aspect And newcomers realize very fast there is a myth and feel great to have joined In short it is a remarkable fair and candid company and I am thrilled to have joined and I plan to go nowhere in the next 5 years,I agree there is no career plan or defined development but then again this translates into a lot of freedom to forge your own path Plus people who are hired are usually senior so I feel there is less of a need for a strict career plan When you work at Netflix you are exposed to so much that it is easy to explain why you grow so much in a short period of time,Senior Program Manager,Current Employee,Los Gatos CA,Nov 18 2014
40,Customer Service Agent,,Great benefits and pay Wonderful people to work with Onsite cafe Flexible scheduling,No formalized QA process What one supervisor loves and recommends you do will get you fired with the next supervisor Its totally subjective and you never see any documentation of how you are being graded Currently the only 2 stats are average handle time and return contact rate You can be exceeding expectations on both and still be fired for not providing an amazing customer experience which could be as simple as your supervisor doesnt think your tone of voice is positive enough Your supervisor can and will sometimes listen to every call you took in a day to find something you did wrong to fire you over You will never see anything in writing on any monitor including the one that gets you fired,Anonymous Employee,Former Employee,Salt Lake City UT,Oct 22 2018
10,Excessive Turnover Work Mobbing Culture of Fear Corporate BS at its FINEST,,pay thats it but it will feel like dirty money after youve been here long enough although evident to me right after I started you will wish you never started here because it will suck away your life and soul the money wont matter Oh this was Pros crap,everything insecure people arrogance letting go of people completely arbitrarily using the annual 360 reviews as a harmless way for peer reviews then using those peer reviews as evidence just as an FYI when you get a team of overpaid untalented bored people writing peer reviews its an incubator for workplace mobbing look it up which happens ALL the time Every week there are at least 1 if not 2 or 3 emails that go around about a team reorganization because someone was let go When those people are your close colleagues youve successfully worked with its completely gross to have to accept their departure while you hang on It wears on your soul and before you know it you HOPE you are let go,Anonymous Employee,Current Employee,nan,Sep 22 2014

20,Terrible They bring you on as a temp and withhold health benefits for up to a year,,Free account Streaming and eight DVDs at a time,They hired on hundreds as temps and told all of us we would be converted and receiving health benefits within three months or be fired for poor performance Well that never happened We were all strung along some of us were fired but by the time six months came along only 30 of the remaining 250 temp employees were given health insurance they kept telling us maybe next month When I finally quit and told them why I was told that they were using benefits as a performance motivator and they extended the conversion time frame to a year I told them that health insurance is something that GOOD employers give their employers not a performance motivator and that they needed to find a better way to motivate their employees Disgusting,Customer Service Representative,Former Employee,Hillsboro OR,Apr 1 2012
50,One of the best But can it sustain,,They treat you like adults There is very less politics If you have the stuff you will really excel They pay you well They have a Steve Jobsclass CEO They have a fantastic vision thanks to Reed Hastings You are bound to have world class colleagues,The most touted culture is changing as the company grows,nan,Former Employee,nan,May 26 2014
20,Good for the short run high turnover long hours dont get too comfortable,,Health insurance from day 1 is always nice,Hostile work environment They are constantly hiring and firing If you dont meet the metrics be prepared to walk Management fires people and says nothing to their teammates You can take a reduction in pay to get vacation time which I found completely ridiculous I did not ever feel like they appreciated the hard work that I did I exceeded all metrics trained new hires and monitored the team chat for assisting on calls People who have worked there for 2 years have never gotten a raise In addition to the above I found the people there to be extremely unhealthy Netflix offers food in the break room but all of it is cheap with high sodium levels and MSG simply add water heat and serve Ill pass The customers can also be downright abusive at times Why on earth do you feel the need to cuss someone out when your movie didnt arrive Calm down folks,Customer Service Representative,Current Employee,Hillsboro OR,May 15 2010

10,For Engineers this place is a joke,,Youre given independence and the ability to do your job how you see fit some of the time Most of the time management runs around like a chicken with their collective head cut off and priorities constantly change,The salaries are competitive but not particularly high despite what their so called slide deck proclaims Keep in mind that your stock purchase and bonus is included so 160k at Google is the same as 210k at Netflix Constant threats of firi,Senior Software Engineer,Former Employee,Los Gatos CA,Dec 12 2012

10,Customer service representative,,The culture is wonderful the management make it hard to be there There is free s snacks and plenty of training but there is zero follow through on the floor,The customer DOES NOT come first “ say what you have to get them off the phone” we literally were told to lie on a daily basis All “soups” and their management are uneducated therefore all laws set into place to protect employees are completely ignored If something is said then there will be retaliation is a huge part of the “I” which is wrong Example no restroom break you ask you get told no You go anyway so you don’t get yourself “dirty” you get pulled in a conference room and talked too breastfeeding is a no no too there’s no place to go and it needs to be done in a certain amount of time and at a certain time There are things you can’t rush you don’t get paid for coming in You only get paid when you’ve gone through 4 screens to open that special window to beck It’s always slow and they get angry that we’ve clocked in late There’s 2 choice pay the extra 3 minutes or don’t complain that were not logged in on time young and cute you can do whatever you want mature people that have amazing statistics and quality ratings aren’t recognized,nan,Former Employee,nan,Feb 22 2019

40,High performance company that does what it says it does,,Quality and engagement of coworkers at all levels no dead wieght Transparency and consistency of communication Compensation and benefits,Turnover lack of job security limited opportunity for advancement Netflix hires very specifically for each position They dont want folks to move around within the company trying out different departments theyd rather hire experts in each area If the business changes and your role is no longer necessary youll leave they wont try to slot you into something else where youre not the perfect fit even if youve been there forever and everyone thinks youre great They dont want to hire an Analyst and see if they can grow into a Manager role if the role calls for a Manager theyll hire one in the first place This is different and a little more stressful than other nontech companies Ive worked for But the company is completely upfront about these policies to begin with there are no surprises Work hard and enjoy your perfectly qualified and committed coworkers but keep your resume up to date,Manager,Current Employee,Los Gatos CA,Aug 28 2009
10,Stay Away,,Good brand for your resume I guess Outsiders will be impressed if only because the PR machine has been in overdrive convincing people that this is still an innovative company But a stock price bubble does not equal innovation,Most of the honest reviews on here meaning those not written by HR have already covered it but its a terrible place to work a pressurecooker environment full of overpaid but insecure bosses who manage through fear and intimidation Crazy high turnover in every group lots of good people getting pushed out all the time by their managers Then those people are blamed and insulted once theyre gone and unable to defend themselves The company also stopped innovating long ago The salary though substantial is not worth it especially when you see the Clevel insiders routinely cashing out millions in shares like thieves in the night Hmmm what do they know that everyone else doesnt Look elsewhere there are many other more humane ethical and socially rewarding places to get paid welllike Wall Street,Anonymous Employee,Former Employee,Los Gatos CA,Oct 3 2014
20,Highly political culture dysfunctional,,Pay and the Netflix name helps on your resume since most people outside do not know how bad it is inside,Mind numbing Stress Constantly watching your back There are people who have very high title Directors Managers even VPs who got it because theyve managed to stay there the longest Not because they are qualified for the job The long timeroldtimers survived by CYA each others Those who they think are dangerous to their job will get the knife in the back Its not how good you are Its how well you play the game and fit in with the political culture They value safe decisions that do not rock the boat At least in the IT Ops dept that I worked in,Senior Systems Administrator,Former Employee,Los Gatos CA,Dec 26 2013

20,Inspiring company but culture is changing,,Pay is great and the company leadership are inspiring Youll likely have fun every single day From HR to finance to marketing everyone is on top of their game at a way Ive never seen in other companies,While the Silicon Valley culture seems true to form the Los Angeles office culture is falling apart and while everyone is whispering about it no one is surfacing the problem Its becoming a traditional Hollywood institution quickly and I found it extremely disappointing Heres a few issues that seem to be common 1 Little room for employees to grow beyond their current roles and swimlanes 2 The power distance between junior and senior employees in Hollywood functions has rapidly grown 3 Content teams are constantly at war with themselves and other functions 4 Title deflation is real,Anonymous Employee,Former Employee,Los Angeles CA,Sep 18 2017
20,Its like I go to prison 8 hours a day,,Health benefits are amazing the ability to customize your schedule works for me the pay is good for work performed free Netflix is a plus and the meals are cheap,There are a lot of perks working for NetflixCS but in my opinion its the worst job Ive ever had The calls are non stop and repetitive During training you are led to believe that numbers arent important but that isnt the reality Lower level management is very inconsistent Upper management Ive never experienced a problem with I have noticed that politics play a huge role in your success with this company Ive seen deserving people passed up on promotions The turnaround rate is obscene,Customer Service Representative,Current Employee,nan,Dec 19 2017
50,Netflix is a great place for star performers to shine,,Netflix is a great place for highly talented people to work Time and time again I am impressed by the capability of my colleagues and our ability to work together as a team The company also has a very clear strategy and is very focused on executing that strategy which is great because we dont have a lot of ancillary distractions,If you are not a high performer you will not last long at Netflix The company is not afraid to fire people and it happens on a routine basis,Director,Current Employee,Los Gatos CA,Nov 16 2008
50,Netflix is true to their advertised culture of freedom responsibility,,Lack of politics hard problems to tackle extremely bright colleagues lack of bureaucracy context not control style of management no tracking of hours or time off flexible work options Netflix is extremely successful as a company and its a fun business to be in and win at,Always way more to do than people to do the work but Ive never had a job where this wasnt the case Also sometimes hard to find the boundaries between family and work life because there is no tracking of work hours Many of the folks in my area are highly selfmotivated which fosters a selfimposed culture of working nights and weekends,Senior Software Engineer,Current Employee,Los Gatos CA,Mar 22 2009
40,Was sad to see the company change so much in one year,,Lots of room to make your own decisions and think on your feet,When the price change occurred it was a cluster bomb that went off Then it was announced the company was splitting to two one DVD and one Streaming and then it was announced none of that was happening All the while customers were up in arms over this and we in management were always finding things out at the same time customers were so we had no time to prep our staff Some very hard months for moral with our staff Lost a lot of trust with our employee base in terms of management to subordinate relations,Customer Service Supervisor,Former Employee,Hillsboro OR,Oct 27 2012
20,Have a backup plan,,Many of the people who work here are top performers Many companies say they only hire the best yet it feels more consistent here High bar to get in Free snacks and flexible time,Management can and will fire you for any reason they want Dont make the mistake thinking it can only be performance related There are no guidelines to how long it takes to terminate you Before you know a pink slip may be handed to you I saw people get fired without anyone understanding why Corporate culture wants people who strive to make the company better Most are simply yesmen to keep their high salary job Not very diverse Walk around campus for 5 minutes and its clear the demographic they target,Anonymous Employee,Former Employee,Los Gatos CA,Feb 10 2016
10,The Culture Deck is a lie,,Being a part of the fastest and largest Growing streaming companies in the world Inside view on how decision in TV are made Pay is the top of the industry,The culture deck that they push so heavily only applies to those who aren’t of color If you’re a person of color you’ll feel like a complete fish out of water and as if you were there to just meet a quota Your ideas and concerns will never be heard or taken seriously High school clique feel Very sucky energy and stares,Manager,Current Employee,Los Angeles CA,Dec 25 2018
30,Who really is watching,,Great benefits Competitive pay Flexible schedule for the most part Tons of Netflix swag Free Netflix membership Game room Food at a very affordable price,1 They either like you or they don’t You HAVE to play work politics and meet as many upper level managers as possible Your numbers your adaption to their “culture” and your prior work experience DO NOT matter when it comes to growth within the company 2 You can’t get up and use the bathroom Your breaks and lunches can be moved around if approved by WFM so they tell you to move your break up so you can get up and use the bathroom You literally have to fill out HR accommodation forms to have certain privileges such as bathroom use 3 You had an emergency If you have the emergency hours to cover it GREAT But if you don’t expect to be put on probation or fired the next time you walk in They expect you to PTO 24 hours before and it’s like they wanted you to anticipate the emergency 24 hours before 4 Coaching is a joke Literally the sups ask us what WE want to work on What we thought of our own performance and place those ideas into our action plan My question is aren’t the sups suppose to know the problems Aren’t they suppose to be the ones prepared for the meeting and have a course of action It feels like I’m doing their job and they just say “great idea let me write this down and submit it” They will ALWAYS tell you what you are doing wrong but unless upper management makes a comment about moral being down they will never compliment you 5 Utah is a right to work state In plain English it means the company doesn’t need to have a reason to fire you hence why a lot of other big companies place their call centers here This law allows some employers to abuse the stability of employees and base their decisions on emotions instead performance,Customer Service Representative,Current Employee,Salt Lake City UT,Feb 27 2018
20,Tier 3 TRA,,They pay above market averages and provide great benefits,While they really sell their company culture and constantly discuss using good judgement they really want you to do things the way they think it should be done Your good judgement is only good if you follow their opinion of good judgement Even if you have a good reason to do something differently its not okay Their policy of fail well means you can make a mistake once not twice Terminations are frequent and abrupt In the last 68 months they have termed 3 supervisors and about 1518 people There is a higher than average rate of churn here While they pay high wages and provide low cost benefits this is done as a way to make everyone replaceable It makes it easy to attract new employees Earlier this year they also announced plans to change tier 12 support from internal netflix employees to contracted employees with a call center provider,Tier IIITechnical Research Analyst,Former Employee,Salt Lake City UT,Nov 20 2018
40,Great place to work could use some more diversity,,Great people who are smart and capable I appreciate that they hire people who are experienced and proven unlike other places I have worked that hire right out of college and you get a mixed bag that way Love the free healthy food Flexible vacation works well in my org and I was happy not to have to scale down my vacation time after having built up a lot at my last job Just make sure you have your work covered and check in periodically for emergencies other than that no one gives you a hard time Not every team is as flexible with this as mine is from what I gather from talking to other people in other orgs I havent seen a lot of turnover on my team so far but it is still somewhat early days,Not a very diverse environment which is not a surprise if you read their demographic data In particular there are very few women in technical leadership roles Yes this is a problem in this industry in general but I have worked for companies that do a much better job,nan,Current Employee,nan,Apr 5 2016
30,Uncomfortable environment with lackluster management,,No vacation policy and flexbility High pay which is meant to replace some of the perks that other companies offer Interesting and fun industry Employees are smart and work as a team for the greater good,The freedom and responsiblity culture works for some as long as you do not disagree with management There is very high turnover When people are let go they are surprised People are afraid to make mistakes which makes for a stressful enviroment I have never felt comfortable working there Management is out of touch with its customers and makes hasty decisions that contradict common sense Employees suffer because of this Why would the former CFO leave when the stock on its way to its peak,nan,Former Employee,Los Gatos CA,Oct 13 2011

50,Netflix is the place to be,,A great culture that focuses on freedom responsibility and tries to avoid the pitfalls of typical Hollywood You work among the best and brightest Youre treated like an adult in terms of how when to do your work as long as it gets done and is done well Plus I mean who can resist free food,The culture isnt for everyone If youre not performing at your best you could be let go Not a place for people who try to skate by,Anonymous Employee,Current Employee,nan,Sep 29 2018
50,Netflix deserves its status as a top tier company,,Professionally rewarding positively competitive fairly flat management hierarchy great benefits intellectually stimulating clearly stated goals and procedures Taking part in a world class trendsetting company with extremely high customer satisfaction and industrypeer respect All employees are treated as adults with the attendant expectations and responsibilities,Conflict is somewhat encouraged sometimes to the detriment of internal morale Learning curve is steep and you must constantly perform at full steam Your first 6 months will be sink or swim Commuting from outside south bay is hectic and uncompensated Team shuffling can be a bit spastic A bit of internal politicking does occur,Senior Visual Designer,Former Employee,Los Gatos CA,Jun 11 2008
20,Dont think your going to be taking some long vacations and slacking off friends,,They pay about 20 above market The options and ESPP benefits are better than any other company I have worked for The management is smart as hell If you wonder where people from Harvard MIT Stanford and Yale workits at Netflix There is unlimited time offIll explain that one in a minute Every employee there is a top achiever no dead weight no people you dread because they dont get their work done,People get fired right and left They churn the bottom 25 of the workforce constantly I emailed someone for a month without realizing they had been fired People never take vacation even though they have the unlimited rule You are expected to achieve at a level that will burn you out if your not careful If you slack off prepare to get the boot I did not get fired I left on my own will but I found the environment very stressful,nan,Current Employee,Los Gatos CA,May 19 2009

10,Freedom and,,Organic juices and couple of nonGmo Snacks But all the rest is GMO,Contractors are used abused kicked to the curb and finally fired The company takes no responsibility whats so ever for all the people who are inevitably loosing or will loose their job in a matter of very few months or in the worst case scenario right before health insurance is about to kick in There is no such thing as high performance The company just uses and abuses hire and fire really talented people found by a random staffing agency that will promise you 6 months Netflix prefers to hire full time likable people only not skilled people Upper management simply micro manages every little baby step you are allowed to take yet full time peers will bash you and take you down until you are fired The company will not fire people that have been working there for a while even though they cannot keep up with the company growth Full time peers with less skills less education and less valuable experience will clearly tell you to back off and will stab you in the back until you are gone since you represent a threat to them,Anonymous Employee,Former Employee,nan,Aug 31 2015
30,Getting worse as Netflix grows,,Salary Perks transportation lunch swag celebrations Business is great customers are happy Internal tools are generally quite good,Too much coordination required to get anything accomplished too much coupling between systems in contrast to stated culture Poor engineering practices on most teams and very difficult to get teams to move to newer technology As company has grown managers have taken a more active role to the detriment of the code and architecture No leadershipseniority path for engineers which also implies all engineers believe that they are special snowflakes This makes it hard to push for big changes Engineering talent is decreasing over time,Senior Software Engineer,Former Employee,Los Gatos CA,Sep 19 2017

40,Fast pace and fair,,There are a lot of rumors about how Netflix treats its employees The culture deck you see on the job site is real The management team expects you to be a stellar performer but you CAN make mistakes in the name of learning However if you dont learn quickly from the mistake you made you are in trouble You have a lot of freedom and responsibilities to help company move forward Things also change so quickly that what you think is true last quarter may not be a month from now Stay ahead of the curve and be prepared to defend your opinion with data and facts,There are some politics in the marketing department The CMO comes from a big movie studio so he believes in flashy commercials and campaigns There is a constant need to prove your teams worthiness which can be mind numbing,Anonymous Employee,Former Employee,Los Gatos CA,May 10 2016
50,I wish I wouldve joined years ago,,Think of the people youve worked with in your career Now imagine the 5 best of those on one team Thats what working on a team at Netflix is like Frankly there are no stupid people here None Everyone Ive met is damn sharp very sharing of their knowledge and time and enjoys what they do You are treated like an adult You are not told what to do Netflix is laissez faire not command and control With that comes responsibility and the potential for failure If you fail often enough you will not survive If you dont expose yourself to this risk enough you wont survive Some people might consider this a downside you wont like it at Netflix if you do The Netflix time offvacation policy is that there is no policy They dont track how many hours you take You take time off when you want to you dont have to ask for permission or approval This nonpolicy is one example of many of how thoroughly Netflix expects you to behave like an adult Ive spent many years at big name valley companies Without exception everyone of them claims that they treat employees like adults All of them pale in comparison to Netflix in this regard,Im a developer and the code base at Netflix has warts that demonstrate its laissez faire culture There is no architecture group with veto power so the code evolves organically I personally think this is great but it can be frustrating Luckily it never stays ugly for long but it frequently feels like a ball of mud There seems to be quite a bit of turnover The first month I worked here I counted at least 5 good bye emails At least 4 of them were not voluntary This can be disconcerting But this is also not a company like Cisco with regular annual headcount reduction quotas,Senior Software Engineer,Current Employee,Los Gatos CA,Jul 13 2008

40,Strong company for self starters Call Center needs work,,Focused on individuals who can self manage and get their work done Netflix has nice in house perks the movies etc and pretty good benefits vacation Fast paced change,Not clear goal setting or expectations from senior directors or management and when something does come down the pipe then it tends to be a bit frantic and get it done now instead of always doing comprehensive future planning Call center managers all have very different management personalities and dont seem to be as calibrated on aspects which then reflects out the the floor and floor then tends to think that the managers who are more hard line and terminate more are the favorites of upper management Change that happens has positive end results but transitions communication to the call center floor are not done as well or as immediate as they could be,Manager,Current Employee,Hillsboro OR,Mar 5 2009
50,Senior Data Scientist,,Excellent culture freedom to learn and to work on exciting projects Great compensation package The company treats their employees well and shows their appreciation for the hard work that makes Netflix great,Culture is not for everyone so if you realize that the culture doesnt fit with you or your values it is best for everyone if you determine that early on,Senior Data Scientist,Current Employee,Los Gatos CA,Sep 27 2017

50,Overall it was a great experience I loved working for Netflix,,The pay was great they offer competitive wages for hourly supervisors and salary for the managers within the hub operations You can advance quickly within the hub They have wonderful tech support They promote great culture and great values within the hub Most hubs have really great solid group of hourly employees and management can have vacation pretty much whenever Company poured gifts on the management at the annual meetings to show their appreciation They have a really great HR team,It was really tough to manage work life and home life due to the crazy hours You are there until the job is done for the day so you never have an out time Upper management beyond the hubs gets a little dicey Upper management is full of people who only got hired because they knew the right people not because of their talent or embodiment of the company values and because of that really poor decisions are made when it comes to hiring managers to run the hub operations and when to fire hub managers as well but HR is there to keep most things in check The annual management meetings are a giant frat party with an excess of drinking and the only way to get in with the upper management is to rub shoulders with them and drink alongside of them It also was hard to respect your regionals in the morning after talking with them as they slur their words into a puddle of drool and cant even stand up by 930pm Only other downside was they did pry into your personal life far too often They wanna tell you who you can hang out with and dont want you fraternizing with anyone outside of work,Assistant Manager,Former Employee,Lansing MI,Jul 10 2013

50,Netflix builds careers and character,,Netflix is a household name and is loved by its customers From a professional standpoint it is a company that encourages high performance autonomy and effectiveness Every employee at Netflix puts the company before himselfherself and is encouraged to voice his or her opinion Our CEO Reed Hastings happens to be one of the most brilliant and innovative leaders of the industry and he always has an open door policy to his employees,It is extremely focused on the culture of its people This is not exactly a downside but to certain individuals who are used to a structured corporate environment this may not be the right place for them,nan,Current Employee,Beverly Hills CA,Nov 17 2008
20,Be prepared to sell your soul,,Free unlimited movie rentals Good Pay for the area Unlimited vacation there is a caveat to this You can say you worked in the movie industry,Never being treated as a human being was my main complaint The turnover was and still is ridiculously high The no rules culture sounds good on paper but in practice is awful because there is never any true direction Employees are held to a certain expectation but are never told what that expectation is The unlimited vacation also sounds good on paper but it is almost impossible to take time off They deliberately keep the employees in the dark and then chastise and even terminate their employment doing something wrong It felt like upper management just did things to cover their backside and let everyone else take the fall when things werent going as planned There was no development of people whatsoever,Manager,Former Employee,Hillsboro OR,Jul 22 2009

50,ILoveMyJob,,Freedom and Responsibility is the fabric of the culture The mentality to be able to make changes and shift gears quickly allows us to execute in a manner that I have never experienced before in my previous companies The inherit trust allows me to grow and the feedback and candor allows teams to refine great ideas to execution We are treated like adults here and you are your own police,I dont have any major qualms other then a smaller detail that their isnt a gym on campus There is a discount for the gym across the street or access to another close to campus,Manager,Current Employee,Los Gatos CA,Oct 20 2015
40,Netflix Marketing,,The freedom responsibility culture is real It is nice to go to battle alongside fullyformed adults who are the best at what they do The product is amazing and incredibly fun to market Reed is an incredible leader…focused and effective,While one of the plus sides of the debate culture is gathering multiple perspectives on your work the downside is that you can get slowed down by the need to accommodate a myriad of stakeholders Marketing leadership also hasnt quite found the right balance of art and science While Netflix has become an entertainment brand it should be careful to not set up an organization that actslooksfeels exactly like a Hollywood company If you are not in LA andor working on creative it has become increasingly difficult to feel like you are truly part of the Netflix marketing organization,Anonymous Employee,Current Employee,nan,Feb 20 2016
10,DO NOT WORK AT THIS COMPANY,,Given a very high salary with extensive benefits such as unlimited PTO and food,HORRIBLE management managers dont want to teach they just expect you to be great without any coaching or they will find someone else who will It is a complete lie when their culture memo preaches that they give employees feedback with time to work on their managers unreasonably high expectations they do not give you any idea that you are not meeting expectations just let you go without warning If you want to ruin your self esteem confidence worklife balance for a high salary this is the place for you,Recruiter,Current Employee,Los Gatos CA,Jun 9 2020

10,DO NOT WORK FOR NETFLIX,,If you want a free subscription then go for it,If there were 25 hours in a day Netflix would expect you to work all 25 They could care less about you as a person and they DO NOT hold to their core values of honesty and integrity People are promoted based on political connection rather than real ability There are no congratulations for a job well done but plenty of abuse when things arent done to perfection There are no SOPs for processes and procedures but Regional Managers and Regional Directors will criticize for not doing it right It was my worst experience of my professional career,Operations Manager,Former Employee,Saint Louis MO,Apr 3 2009
20,Training is fun but then the real nightmare starts,,Free food handed out a lot casual dress code lots of people in their 20s that you can relate to,Very confusing attendance policy If youre not a permanent employee yet basically you miss a day or two theyll fire you Very little support from upper management when dealing with customers Impossible sometimes to get assistance with problems though they advise that you get their help when needed I was so stressed from continuously being threatened by my supervisor that I might lose my job I couldnt stand it If you want to have any sort of healthy work environment dont work here,Netflix Customer Service Representative,Former Employee,Hillsboro OR,Jul 31 2012

20,False Advertising,,Free coffee and snacks Benefits High percentage of PTO accrual which is being cut in half soon One flexible day off that is impossible to take if you have the beginning of the week off,Is definitely numbers driven even though they tell you it isnt Manipulative management Will use your peers against you Told to ask questions if you dont understand something but dont answer your questions and rarely give good context Coachings that are supposed to happen every week get pushed off for a few weeks to a month No one is on the same page Your job is on the line after the one day you are sick There is definitely an attendance policy regardless of what you hear,CSR1,Current Employee,Salt Lake City UT,Dec 6 2016

40,Great company with some growing pains,,When they say that Netflix chooses stunning colleagues they are not kidding I am constantly impressed with the smart thoughtful people I work with on a daily basis I love the companys focus on Inclusion Diversity and I honestly notice it often by looking around the room and seeing faces like mine in every meeting and I am continually impressed at how the company adheres to these principles The transparency is usually great and its fun to be a part of an exciting growing company The salary is exceptional and the benefits are also excellent note hourly employees get slightly less in terms of benefits but its still great Theres a lot of freedom here to set your schedule and work around personal commitments if you need to eg my kid has a doctors appointment I will be WFH etc as well as to make decisions that benefit the company your team etc The culture deck is intimidating when you first read it but I have found that its pretty right on there are some things that I think are not adhered to quite as often as it says but overall its on point,Work life balance is a thing but I do think a lot of it is how well you defend your boundaries I work a couple of hours of OT a week and I am generally on call in the sense that I will check my email after hours but I am not expected to work at off hours in fact my manager specifically tells me to wait until I am back at work to complete things I do think upper management works very long hours and that can lead to burnout The flip side of this is that there is a lot of flexibility to take vacationpersonal time and people trust you if you need to take some time for doctors appointments stuff for your kids WFH etc The firing culture doesnt seem to touch ICs as much as it does management It is scary sometimes to see those messages come through but the leaders do try to set context and make themselves available for comments questions concerns etc I do think the whole concept of good ideas coming from anywhere is true to some extent but it definitely depends on the team and the leader to whom you are pitching things You have to be smart about choosing the right timepeople The onboardingtraining needs a lot of work Not having a solid training for new hires was stressful and alienating I spent the first few months wondering if I had made the right choice by coming here but I am a year in and feeling much more comfortable They say it takes about 3 months to feel like you are not drowning and 6 months to feel like you understand everything that feels pretty accurate to me,Anonymous Employee,Current Employee,Los Angeles CA,Oct 29 2018

40,Empowering place to work Little bureaucracy for size,,Company culture strives to minimize process in favor of trusting employees and giving them room to run This results in an organization powered by experienced selfstarters who are incredible people to learn from It provides the maturity of a larger company with talented people while still enabling considerable creative freedom Applies to Los Gatos HQ,Coordination can sometimes be weak due to loosely coupled culture It is very easy to get out of sync on goals and expectations with teammates and managers unless one is very vigilant and communicates well Most managers try to adhere to the culture but each deviates in their own idiosyncratic way,Anonymous Employee,Current Employee,Los Gatos CA,May 10 2014

40,Customer Service Representative,,The people who work there are phenomenal No petty workplace drama helpful environment The pay was fair No scripts Coaching was built on behaviors and I was lucky enough to have very good coaches,No room for advancement metric driven environment so if you have a bad supervisor and a bad week you will probably get told to change what usually works With the fast call times it can be hard to politely get people off the phone and the survey at the end only asks if they like Netflix so even if the person loves your service it may affect your stats negatively,Customer Service Representative,Former Employee,Hillsboro OR,May 23 2015
10,Dont get comfortable,,High pay freedom and responsibility,Everything else If you want to work 90 hours a week have no family life and still get fired after nothing but glowing reviews then this place is for you In my case I gave direct actionable feedback about a colleague and that led to my dismissal The culture deck says feedback is never used to retaliate but thats not true at all So fair warning if you give someone honest feedback about how to improve in their position be prepared for that to bite you later on Politics is real here people are retained or promoted based on who they know and people are so routinely fired here regardless of their performance that everyone is numb to it Glad to see my time here coming to an end If you like playing dirty politics at work then youve found a good place If you want psychological safety at work keep moving,Anonymous Employee,Current Employee,Los Gatos CA,Aug 14 2017

50,Bright people who are fun to work with in very highperformance culture,,Walk the walk consistent with the wellarticulated culture Very focused Clear wellarticulated strategy with very good execution against it Very transparent both internally and externally,A bit of a culture of fear articulated as the sniper in the building as some new hires and longtime employees are either bad fit or fail to grow and are subsequently let go Culture emphasizes experimentation which includes needed organizational experiments and this type of experimentation also reinforces the fear Again most of this wellarticulated in culture deck so no surprise,Vice President,Former Employee,Los Gatos CA,Oct 18 2012
40,Great place to work but not for everyone,,Little to no micromanagement Control and ownership of software components you are responsible for Exceptional compensation Incredible vacation policy,Not for everyone developers who like working independently and without much guidance will thrive here Developers who are used to being given specific assignments and lots of structure might crash and burn and get fired Extremely stressful working situations at times as you will be responsible for a lot and might not have backup and potential for very long hours If you dont have the courage to ask for your vacations you might not get any no formal vacation policy,Senior Software Engineer,Former Employee,Los Gatos CA,Sep 17 2014
20,Senior Software Engineer,,Best place if you just want to work with great technically capable folks 1520 higher pay but if you actually consider everything it might not be that big of a deal Check what will be inhand salary after taxes because taxes also go high with salary Somewhat transparent workplace but at times higher management takes ridiculous decisions like Quickster what the hell Reed gets thing right most of the time except Quickster and understand what he is doing,Worst place where all technically capable folks are also so heavy on political games within the team Also it depends on which team you are part of My general observation is larger the team greater the politics being played within IT IS LITERALLY TRUE THAT IT IS CULTURE OF FEAR no matter how talented you are I have seen ppl being walked out they were far more talented than other mediocre engineers surviving there for 34 years just because they lick the managers as and I have seen managers loving it being licked Few managers who came from Google or some other similar companies think that they know everything in the world and act as if they rule the world but actually they are literally dumb as when it comes to real work They claim it is all rockstar engineers and the fire who are not but I have seen ppl surviving for ages not even knowing what they did for all these years at Netflix and they are pure mediocre engineers My advice to engineers would be if you are happy with the work what you are doing right now or with other offers in hand dont fall for the salary trap it is merely an illusion,Senior Software Engineer,Current Employee,Los Gatos CA,Mar 15 2013
50,The culture is the real deal read the deck It really is the blueprint for our culture,,Freedom and Responsibility from the culture deck is true Super smart people that love what they do Awesome brand Compensation is top of market,Things move quickly sometimes hard to keep up High performing culture means there is pressure but deliver rather than worry and you will be fine,Director,Current Employee,Los Gatos CA,Feb 23 2015
20,Can be a great place to work if you fit in,,Incredibly bright individuals to work with The product is incredible LOTs of perks and comp is ridiculously good,It makes sense why they comp so well The idea that there is a culture fear is very real Everyone ramps up differently but if you dont fit in then you get cut Everyday there were constant reminders of consequences if you didnt fit their one hundred something culture deck Managers give challenging feedback but its really an excuse for them to judge harshly and put you down,Anonymous Employee,Former Employee,Los Gatos CA,May 17 2017
40,Decent Place to work,,In this time of uncertainty this is a good job You have to be self motivated and naturally competitive to survive here Free food for working mandatory extra hours Stock option Free subscription Clean facilities good,A bit scary in terms of job security at first If youre scared for your job after being there for a few months then you are likely not a good fit Advancement is limited and competitive Getting approved time off AOL little old ladies prepaid,Customer Service Representative,Current Employee,Hillsboro OR,May 4 2010
50,Amazing company for growth,,Exposure to a lot of interesting challenges No day is the same A lot of room for professional and personal growth Some amazing colleagues who work selflessly and make the team an awesome place to contribute to,Long hours Priorities change frequently Constant pivoting can lead to change fatigue Not everyone embraces the company values the same way Some people take advantage of the freedom part of Freedom and Responsibility Culture differences between LA and LG offices,Vendor Manager,Current Employee,Los Gatos CA,Nov 8 2019
50,If you get the chance work there,,The company gives employees a lot of autonomy to get your work done It values customer input numbers and data and rewards creativity It has a solid management team that has been at the company for many years and guided it through very turbulent times particularly the Blockbuster threat The company attracts smart and creative talent in its departments making it a good place to continue learning,This is a jewel of a company with little downsides Perhaps the kitchen could be better stocked with health foods but then everyone is not Google,nan,Former Employee,Los Gatos CA,Jul 15 2008
40,Great place to work for risktaking high performers,,You are surrounded by very bright people focused on creating a great product for our subscribers and a great environment for employees Its exciting to be on the cuttingedge of media and technology The company offers a lot of freedom and the responsibility that comes with it Employees are treated like the adults they are,If you like stability this may not be the place for you We have a high performance culture and in addition may change directions suddenly for the good of the whole business impacting people and projects in which heavy investment may have been made The company does not manage your career you manage your career Depending on the department there can be limited opportunities for advancement,Vice President,Current Employee,Los Angeles CA,Nov 17 2008
30,Never regretted working there but definitely got out at the right time,,Great compensation for those of us that started before Netflix became a household name Some of the best benefits available especially vacation time alloted after 90 days Stock options that really turned into something Begin able to say you work for Netflix Everyone knows what it is now,LONG hours and hours that never stabilized Became a machine repair person at the hub spending most of my time fixing equipment problems at the end Had all the vacation in the world but almost impossible to get time off approved especially if you wanted to take multiple days in a row off,nan,Current Employee,Michigantown IN,Jul 7 2009
10,Its a job but only just that,,No reason to work there unless you are a masochist You can earn the same money selling vacuum cleaners,Where do I start No respect for employees No vacation time No sick leave No consistency No defending yourself No dialogue No sense of reason No rules for managers supervisors or teachers pets Career Advancement practically guarantees youll be fired This is an awful oppressive fearful negative and pitiful place to work Seriously go to Burger King or Walmart because theyll treat you better For the good wage cough youll end up with ulcers and a need to explain why you were fired to your next employer,Customer Service Representative,Current Employee,Hillsboro OR,Aug 12 2009

20,Good in the short term but,,Netflixs top management has a simple and well thought out strategic vision which they communicate well to employees The company is consistently profitable and salaries tend to be substantially above the market rates,Netflix pays well to get the best person for the job The downsides of this are that often people are overqualified for what they are doing which can lead to a lack of challenge for them Worse Netflix quickly and unceremoniously fires anyone whose skills no longer match the available work or even whose manager doesnt especially like them Retraining people for different jobs just doesnt occur If the immediate work fits your professional goals Netflix can be a good place to work but dont plan on a long career there,Senior Software Engineer,Former Employee,Los Gatos CA,Dec 13 2008
30,Great for movie lovers without families,,If you love movies this is a great place to be Benefits and salary are very competitive Lots of perks like free DVDS snacks drinks etc People are fun and creative,Depending on what area you work in your experience can be vastly different You will watch your cubicle neighbor leave early to go to a movie while youre late to pick up your kid from daycare because your manager thinks a 2hour meeting should be scheduled for 5 pm and include the entire department whether its relevant to you or not Its also really a sink or swim atmosphere you even have to figure out how to find your own office supplies when you start,nan,Former Employee,Beverly Hills CA,Jan 7 2009
50,Great summer job,,As much as the customers could be awful sometimes Netflix really tried to make us happy The supervisors were very hands on and always there to help My team of coworkers were very helpful too We were always in group chats discussing issues There were always contests going around and fresh fruits in the break rooms,The only con really is that you dont get to choose your hours You may get stuck with the overnight shift or working all weekend days They do pay you more for those hours though,Customer Service Representative,Former Employee,Portland OR,Aug 18 2014

40,Great place to work so far,,Ive had a great experience so far especially after coming from another company where it was all about politics and not about delivering results My Netflix experience so far is that if youre smart and get stuff done you will be appreciated and rewarded If youre looking for handholding this is not the place for you But if youre entrepreneurial selfmotivated and like challenging the status quo then Netflix is a great place to work,None so far other than the commute The lunches get a bit repetitive but whos complaining when they bring it in for free OK I suppose it would be nice if they didnt always have meetings during the lunch hour but thats about the biggest complaint I have and I dont even really mind,Senior Manager,Current Employee,Los Gatos CA,Oct 26 2011

50,Great place to work so long as you fit the mold,,Great people to work with great leadership and constant ability to get your geek on so long as you fit the mold,Netflix does not invest in training its people the expectation is for you to already be a star or to make yourself a star through your own efforts Like Reed H has been quoted it is a baseball team However if you fit the mold this is fine,Anonymous Employee,Former Employee,nan,Apr 4 2017
20,This place is absolutely grueling they eat you up and spit you out,,Salaries are at or above the market rate Good stock options for salaried employees The ability to work remotely from home,Working around the clock phone calls during vacation Very high attrition rates Constant fear of being let go Always switching directions while running full speed ahead,nan,Former Employee,Hillsboro OR,May 15 2011
10,Content Operations Manager,,Smart group of mostly young people Top of market salaries Stock option Perksstocked kitchens daily catered lunch offsite teambuilding activities swag,Benefits allowance doesnt go as far as it should if youre not twentysomethingwithout dependents The companys values of freedom and responsibility are quite clear in theory How these translate on the ground is quite another thing that can only be described as a sort of collective narcissis The environment is one in which everyone is constantly trying to prove their worth while watching their own back The responsibility part of the equation is not reciprocal Its sink or swim Employees are let go quietly and efficiently sort of erased If youre a libertarian or a fan of Ayn Rand good luck and enjoy the great pay Otherwise dont drink the KoolAid,Anonymous Employee,Former Employee,Los Angeles CA,Apr 24 2015
10,Treated like a GrownUp,,A very nice building in Beverly Hills,If you interviewed with Netflix and didnt get the job be happy Boredom and fear are the only feelings around You will walk in every single day fearing that its your last day there no matter who you are contractor or full time Its not worth it The pressure the anxiety the fear They have been massively hiring and now they are firing for no reason Well from what I have seen its either because they thought they needed you but they really dont or because you are about to become too expensive after roughly 24 months with health insurance etcThe bottom line is you are not treated like a grown up but just as a tool and management is completely useless,nan,Current Employee,nan,Sep 8 2015
50,Great company if you fit,,Stunning colleagues no politics constant challenges on performance can have startup like experience zero tolerance toward untransparency top of the market pay,International expansion needs to be better handled no vacation policy means no vacation infinite competition and high expectation too fragmented org structure,Senior Manager,Former Employee,Los Angeles CA,Oct 27 2017

10,DO NOT WORK FOR NETFLIX,,If you want a free subscription then go for it,If there were 25 hours in a day Netflix would expect you to work all 25 They could care less about you as a person and they DO NOT hold to their core values of honesty and integrity People are promoted based on political connection rather than real ability There are no congratulations for a job well done but plenty of abuse when things arent done to perfection There are no SOPs for processes and procedures but Regional Managers and Regional Directors will criticize for not doing it right It was my worst experience of my professional career,Operations Manager,Former Employee,Saint Louis MO,Apr 3 2009
20,Training is fun but then the real nightmare starts,,Free food handed out a lot casual dress code lots of people in their 20s that you can relate to,Very confusing attendance policy If youre not a permanent employee yet basically you miss a day or two theyll fire you Very little support from upper management when dealing with customers Impossible sometimes to get assistance with problems though they advise that you get their help when needed I was so stressed from continuously being threatened by my supervisor that I might lose my job I couldnt stand it If you want to have any sort of healthy work environment dont work here,Netflix Customer Service Representative,Former Employee,Hillsboro OR,Jul 31 2012

20,Reed between the lines,,Liberal time off policyoh wait youre so overworked you dont have time to take advantage of it Casual dress code,Horrible communication from upper management and they are fully aware of this Lack of growth potential In fact many employees are told during the interview process that they are expected to leave within a few years as there is no where for them to go Understaffed and overworked but this is excused by being referred to as a part of the internet culture,Manager,Former Employee,Los Angeles CA,Dec 30 2008
10,Netflix is the same as working for HBOTime Warner but everyone trying to pretend you work for Google,,They pay a ridiculous amount of money,Horrible culture everyone is afraid they will get fired any second People hire their own friendsgroups or people with less skillsexperience so they can defend themselves against weaker employees and throw them under the bus Lord help you if you dont know anyone when you get hired to form a posse with,Senior Software Engineer,Former Employee,Los Gatos CA,Sep 14 2017
50,The Right Place If You Are The Right Fit,,So far I am incredibly impressed with Netflix This is by far the highest concentration of smart people I have ever seen at one company and I have worked in Silicon Valley for over 20 years at large and small companies In addition not only are they smart but also very helpful and ego free I read the culture slide deck before I started but wondered if they actually walked the walk Ive found the answer to that question to be absolutely If you are not a really smart driven person who can operate completely independently and with little direction from management then you will not be happy or successful at Netflix There is no hand holding and expectations are high But if you are the kind of person that craves lots of freedom and responsibility than you will love it In the period of time Ive been here I have personally seen several people get promoted from engineers to managers and from managers to directors There is a lot of career growth as the company is growing like gangbusters right now and if you are great you will love it and thrive,If you are looking for safety and worried that you wont get another job somewhere else Netflix is not the place for you Basically Netflix operates like a Startup company There is no hand holding you have to make lots of important decisions on your own you have to be proactive about seeking out help and information and the culture is fast paced and filled with lots of people who would be the smartest guys in the room at other companies At Netflix the whole room is filled with those guys If that intimidates you or scares you thats a sign its not a good fit for you If that lights you up and excites you then you will love working at Netflix,Engineering Manager,Current Employee,Los Gatos CA,Apr 2 2011
20,Neurotic and unforgiving,,Extremely creative engineers and products Interesting and fun business Exciting opportunities for access to entertainment Exceptionally bright senior management This company can really grow and be very successful,Everyone is afraid to make a mistake or be perceived as making a mistake Sr management is constantly questioning new managers opinions and judgement If one wants to be successful at Netflix do exactly as your told Not allowed to have a new idea or different opinion Netflix management hides behind values that dont exist,nan,Former Employee,Los Gatos CA,Jul 14 2011

50,LOVE IT,,The company culture makes every day a superior work experience I have stellar colleagues and interesting challenges every day I look forward to coming to work every day,High performance is expected at all times which is not challenging by itself but it can wear you down if you dont handle stress well,Content Distribution Coordinator,Current Employee,Beverly Hills CA,Oct 28 2016
20,False Advertising,,Free coffee and snacks Benefits High percentage of PTO accrual which is being cut in half soon One flexible day off that is impossible to take if you have the beginning of the week off,Is definitely numbers driven even though they tell you it isnt Manipulative management Will use your peers against you Told to ask questions if you dont understand something but dont answer your questions and rarely give good context Coachings that are supposed to happen every week get pushed off for a few weeks to a month No one is on the same page Your job is on the line after the one day you are sick There is definitely an attendance policy regardless of what you hear,CSR1,Current Employee,Salt Lake City UT,Dec 6 2016

50,Netflix is a great place for hard working talented people,,From the top down my collegues at Netflix are the among the most talented individuals in their class of trade There is not a set vacation policy other than take it when you need it Maybe the best reason of all is the communication Management goes to great lengths to make sure that everyone in the organization has a full understanding of the opportunities and challenges facing the business as well as the strategic vision that the company is executing against,In an effort to keep the best person in every position turnover is somewhat high,Director of Content,Current Employee,Los Angeles CA,Nov 17 2008
20,Revisiting my review after working here for a while There are better rewarding careers out there,,Its a decent JOB emphasis on purpose if you are looking for a heads down monotonous coding job If you can manage a decent amount of work and the perspective you will have a stable pay check,I was sold on all the culture stuff and drank the coolaid at first After spending a lot f time at Netflix my perspective has changed for the worse What good is the sales pitch if you cant deliver Some organizations are terrible i am not talking about IT backoffice type group when it comes to recognizing people allowing forget about encouraging their growth No carrer no recognition In a way its a career deadend Its a JOB Recent breakneck hiring has bought in a TON of managers eg instead of bringing in 1 project manager theyve hired 1 managers Believe it or not it takes 4 times the amount of meetings compared to 2 years ago at Netflix to get 12 of what we used to get done in the same period of time Today all of the talk about culture except firing people for no good reason freedom etc are just BS No family insurance medical dental etc Company only pays for the employee but in reality they dont care,Senior Software Engineer,Current Employee,Los Gatos CA,Nov 23 2011
40,Not what it used to be,,Insanely high salaries smart and dedicated coworkers high quality programming tons of perks,Hypocrisy Netflix claims that its culture is something special but its as political and hierarchical as any traditional studio or network,Anonymous Employee,Former Employee,Los Angeles CA,Jan 7 2019
10,Toxic Culture Cliquey Environment,,Great benefits and catered lunches,While working at Netflix I have dealt with more cons than pros Especially while working with leadership The directors dont seem to show humility towards their subordinates and their assistants often reflect the same attitudes I can recall a specifc instance when I had to work with the assistants of the CEO Back in November we needed to collaborate on an undisclosed project and I just remember being so astounded at the level of arrogance and superiority that these assistants felt towards me and my team They were EXTREMELY unprofessional ignorant and unproductive I hope Reed one day takes a hold of his company and reevaluates who he hires to represent him,Operations Assistant,Former Employee,Hollywood CA,Mar 19 2020
20,High pay but not worth it,,Used to be top of market pay No longer is but still higher than average Free Netflix account,The Hillsboro call center is shrinking dramatically Management puts as much spin on this as possible but the reality is opportunities to advance do not exist The Netflix culture is hyped constantly but is not actually practiced You will survive if you can speak the buzz words fluently while shamelessly selfpromoting yourself at all times and never questioning management Everyone is under tremendous stress to protect their position for as long as possible Success in Hillsboro depends not on the quality of your work but upon your ability to spin the truth and play politics,Anonymous Employee,Former Employee,Hillsboro OR,Oct 23 2013
10,No Job security Poor Management,,Great Pay Benefits and perks Catered Food,No proper training No room for error or else you will get fired culture Politics Arrogant Managers I worked at Netflix for almost 5 years and Ive always had great feedback during 360 reviews except for 1 person That person who was new to the company gave me a bad review last year and thats the reason I lost my job My manager made that review as a backup to lay me off and totally lied that I am no longer fit for the job Feeling betrayed and unjustly fired,Senior Position,Former Employee,Los Gatos CA,Jan 28 2015

40,A year at Netflix is equal to 23 years most other places talent density creates accomplishment density,,Fastmoving Few bureaucratic distractions Willing to make big disruptive changes quickly The move to original content was smart and will propel growth well into the future If you function well in a meritocracy then you will likely be successful at Netflix,Theyre getting big and that growth is adding pressure to sacrifice some elements of their culture that made them unique and a desirable place to work The quality of talent getting hired or promoted now is much less impressive than in the earlier years The environment is increasingly political which may be related to the hiringpromotion of more average lessimpressive employees,Director Engineering,Current Employee,Los Gatos CA,Nov 29 2013
20,Great Company Inexperienced Management,,Great Product Driven culture Cross Team Collaboration,There are a couple of cons that seem to be proving to become obstacles for productivity My Director loves to bully and has fired the valuable individuals on our team She is afraid of anyone that is smarter than her that also contributes and gets recognized for their contribution Instead of building a great team sadly this Director manages two unrelated teams with no knowledge on how to manage either She thrives on driving fear Sad as most of the people here are genuinely great people,Purchasing,Current Employee,Los Gatos CA,Jan 14 2015
50,A great fun place to work,,The serviceproduct is fun to work on and my friends all know what it is Netflix is very flexible in a number of ways work hours and vacation time my coworkers are competent and the pay is very good,Since we tend to hire experienced engineers in the first place there arent pronounced tiers among engineers so promotions are very rare Promotions seem much more common in management positions and even those seem to be mostly inplace promotions ie the employees responsibilities dont seem to change with the promotion,Senior User Interface Engineer,Current Employee,Los Gatos CA,Apr 22 2008
50,Awesome,,Freedom and responsibility and the company does not sweat the small stuff The company is forward thinking The salary ranges are at the top of the market scale There is a no leave policy meaning that what vacation you want as long as your work is complete Generally most department become amazed at the accomplishments of the other departments work The CEO is inspirational when he speaks and his actions are those of a true leader,I have not found a downside,Director of Security,Current Employee,Los Gatos CA,Nov 21 2008
50,Add Netflix to your job searching queue,,Ive worked in many places in the Valley from small hot startups to large mega corps and Netflix is by far the best place Only running your own company with your own handpicked friends could be better,With great power comes great responsibility There are no safety nets here No one will check up on you and make sure youre okay Its up to you to assess your situation and institute the changes you want and need If you think the above paragraph is really an upside then you will fit right into Netflix,Senior Software Engineer,Current Employee,Los Gatos CA,Mar 23 2009
40,Fantastic place to work,,This is a great place to work if youre genuinely interested in the success of your coworkers and are able to clearly see the connection between that and the success of the business Freedom and responsibility is definitely practiced here No one will hand you a project deadlines and a specific way to go about doing your work They trust that theyve hired the best people to do the job and they leave it up to the individual to identify problems and figure out how to solve them This sort of environment is not for everyone because you have to build strong enough relationships with your coworkers so theyd go to bat for you on your projects Teambuilding isnt a companymandated activity here Its an everyday practice and an integral part of the job Feedback is candid and immediate so get ready Theres no sugarcoating here To be successful here you have to be open to criticism no matter how direct This again might not work for everyone but it makes your next course of action very clear as opposed to sugarcoated feedback that leaves you confused as to what you should do,Netflix gets a bad rap because its not for everyone The fact is thats not necessarily a bad thing and theres no shame in trying something out and seeing if it works out for you What appears difficult about Netflix is exactly what makes it a great place to work You have to be able to manage yourself no one will manage your time for you While the company is not as diverse as it could be the commitment to diversity is something Ive witnessed firsthand from leadership and employees alike The tone is set that diversifying the company is a part of everyones job at Netflix not just the recruiting team If you need someone to manage your time for you need your tasks to be very clear and outlined by a manager or you cant handle feedback then Netflix isnt for you,Anonymous Employee,Current Employee,Los Gatos CA,Apr 8 2016

10,the culture of fear is real,,top of the market compensation and good product,Very political and the culture of fear is real People will badmouth you behind your back just to save their jobs and since there are no HR processesrules or documentation your entire existence will depend on manager Talking of which personally I had two managers so far One who never led bigger teams before he said inappropriateunprofessional things all the time mind you Netflix is supposed to hire only experienced people The other one was a macho drinking type He always favored the ones who went out with him drinking If you were not into drinkingsocializingalpha male communication style too bad Summary If you only care about money this place is for you but if you want an environment with a positive culture you should look elsewhere,Anonymous Employee,Current Employee,Los Gatos CA,Jun 3 2017

30,Netflix The good the bad and the ugly,,Netflix is a place where you are surrounded by some really great minds I wouldnt even say that SOME of the people are good while others somehow seemed to slip in If you arent one of the best in your line of work I dont think youll ever get in the door here Ive been here for a number of years and have had the privilege to work with some extremely bright people As an employee and part of a team its good to know that whatever you are working on is going to be top notch because of who is working on it Netflix also encourages you to learn and explore new technologies and expand your own knowledge base At past companies this was always a problem If something didnt directly relate to what you were working on well you had to make excuses and come up with reasons why you wanted to try something new At Netflix they not only encourage it but really urge you to try to broaden your own skill set Our paid time off policy is not to be beat Netflix has none No two weeks a year or so many days off for personalsick leave GARBAGE Instead you just tell your manager that you wanted to take three weeks off next month and he says okay have a good time Well see ya when you get back How cool is that Its all about Movies for me I used to think I was a bit if a movie buff Yeah that was until I worked here and met real movie buffs Meetings are filled with references to movies In one of the team meetings I go to every week you can count the number of Ferris Buellers day off lines Show me the money Netflix really does pay well I left my old job doing the EXACT same thing I do here the only difference is I make X2 as much Id like to write more but those reasons alone are pretty good,When I first started the head of HR said Netflix is a high performance environment Often I feel like they have confused high pressure with high performance and believe me there is a difference Sometimes I feel like they overly eggagerate the importance of SOME features I mean no one is going to die on the table here guys its just a movie rental company Our medicalhealth benefits are mediocre at best and HR doesnt seem to care that the majority of employees are totally dissatisfied with the offerings After constant employee complaints on how high our benefit prices are HR comes back with even higher prices this year while having even less coverage Im not buying the line they fed us either benefits are more expensive everywhere across the country Whatever if I gave that as an excuse why I didnt get a project completed on time Id be talked to Every year we have this total JOKE of a per review process 360 reviews You HAVE to rate your peers and get ratings back from the people you asked to rate you From my experience its totally pointless and a huge waste of time energy across the company If we spent even a quarter of the time and money it takes to run manage and maintain this 360 review process wed have double the amount of movies in our Watch Instantly offering Dont come here thinking youll rise through the ranks That just doesnt happen here Yes there are a few people who have started out as individual contributors and risen to the higher ranks but for the most part Ive watched very talented people leave Netflix to get management positions else where and Netflix doesnt really care When you accept a job here it will most likely be in the same position for the rest of your time at Netflix There is also a very big brother feel here Netflix HR is watching you But maybe thats just me People seem to disappear sometimes,Senior Web Engineer,Current Employee,Los Gatos CA,Nov 17 2008
40,Great place to grow your career,,Teamwork is highly valued in the Netflix culture with team members even contributing to peer employee reviews Netflix is performance and goal oriented Everything you do at Netflix is important to the business My team and the teams around me are very bright and are always thinking around how technology can grow the business Netflix management embraces change where they see opportunities to grow the business,Netflix is not a startup and not a big company If you are looking for either of those then this would not be the place for you Change is a given at Netflix nothing stands still,Engineering Manager,Current Employee,Los Gatos CA,Dec 9 2008
20,Stressful is an understatement,,Good pay good benefits awesome co workers,This is one of the most stressful work environments I have EVER worked at Seems like no one has worked there longer than a year Everything is based on your dissatisfied percentage and its impossible to satisfy everyone ESPECIALLY when it is a dsat about service not rep To Netflix its the same damn thing My supervisor was horrible and they all just sit together and chat all day Almost seems like arent doing a damn thing,Customer Service Representative,Current Employee,Hillsboro OR,Oct 21 2010
50,Senior Data Scientist,,Excellent culture freedom to learn and to work on exciting projects Great compensation package The company treats their employees well and shows their appreciation for the hard work that makes Netflix great,Culture is not for everyone so if you realize that the culture doesnt fit with you or your values it is best for everyone if you determine that early on,Senior Data Scientist,Current Employee,Los Gatos CA,Sep 27 2017

10,Netflix Culture of Fear,,The pay is above market Not a lot above market but a bit above market The drawback is there are absolutely no benefits to speak of no health benefits no training no daycare so that above market pay gets eaten up pretty fast by real world needs,A total fear of failure permeates the ranks Netflix basically gives you a warning on your first mistake and then fires you after your second mistake This is why the annual turnover rate is well over 20 Since there is an entirely new set of employees every few years nobody knows what process to follow and everything is chaotic HR solves this by saying there is no process for anything Make it up as you go along Sure if I fired all the employees every few years Id stay away from process too The key problem is that with all the firings most employees spend the day simply trying to find cover The ass covering at Netflix is legendary Nobody wants to innovate Nobody wants to reach outside their comfort zone Netflix has created a culture of fear and the way in which they manage terminations reinforces the culture of fear they immediately demonize the terminated employee and try to make the termination serve as a lesson to others The culture of fear is so ingrained in Netflix that many managers only have one tool for managing their directs and that is to threaten to fire them There simply is no other process for managing poor performance remember there is no process they will admit this to you if you ask And finally the last thing you should be warned about is their high performance culture Their justification for all the firings is that the fired employees werent high performers But since there is no process no recordkeeping there is no objective measurement of performance So high performers end up being the employees that get along with the boss and keep a low profile High performers at Netflix are not employees that take risks interact with outside groups or produce a high volume of work Netflix loves to talk about high performance but they have the lowest standard for high performance that Ive ever seen They are completely happy to manage with fear however If you put those two insane concepts together you end up with a rather hysterical environment,Manager,Former Employee,Los Gatos CA,May 2 2010
50,Overall it was a great experience I loved working for Netflix,,The pay was great they offer competitive wages for hourly supervisors and salary for the managers within the hub operations You can advance quickly within the hub They have wonderful tech support They promote great culture and great values within the hub Most hubs have really great solid group of hourly employees and management can have vacation pretty much whenever Company poured gifts on the management at the annual meetings to show their appreciation They have a really great HR team,It was really tough to manage work life and home life due to the crazy hours You are there until the job is done for the day so you never have an out time Upper management beyond the hubs gets a little dicey Upper management is full of people who only got hired because they knew the right people not because of their talent or embodiment of the company values and because of that really poor decisions are made when it comes to hiring managers to run the hub operations and when to fire hub managers as well but HR is there to keep most things in check The annual management meetings are a giant frat party with an excess of drinking and the only way to get in with the upper management is to rub shoulders with them and drink alongside of them It also was hard to respect your regionals in the morning after talking with them as they slur their words into a puddle of drool and cant even stand up by 930pm Only other downside was they did pry into your personal life far too often They wanna tell you who you can hang out with and dont want you fraternizing with anyone outside of work,Assistant Manager,Former Employee,Lansing MI,Jul 10 2013
50,Really solid company,,I love working here you are pure customer service and you really have freedom in how you do your job The culture is all about honesty and really caring about your customers and you can see that They pay you very well and your paychecks are always consistent You get five weeks paid vacation incredible insurance dental and vision free Netflix and Netflix swag and so much more You are treated as an adult and get to work around a lot of positive good quality people Netflix cares about who they hire and sometimes those people will lose their job because they arent the right fit thus those people come here and leave 1 star propaganda type reviews If you arent going to bring something positive to the work place then why are you even there It makes it amazing to work there because the people who are there are really amazing high quality positive people making this an extremely great environment Im never dreading going to work the supervisors agents and even operations management all talk to each other on a human level and no one is snarly or stuck up Its an extremely chill environment with high expectations You are expected to do your job and be an adult and everything else is extremely relaxed If you think you can come to work and mess around youre not going to have a job long but Ive been here almost a year now and everything is just as amazing now as when it first opened,I wouldnt say there are loads of downsides we are a 24 hour call center so when you are hired you are told you need to be flexible with your work schedule Most schedules youll have for a good 34 months but when new schedules come out you need to be willing to take it on We were told this at least ten times before being hired so you cant really complain And even if you get a schedule you dont want you can trade and they wont stop you,Csr1 Chat,Current Employee,Salt Lake City UT,Sep 21 2015
50,Netflix builds careers and character,,Netflix is a household name and is loved by its customers From a professional standpoint it is a company that encourages high performance autonomy and effectiveness Every employee at Netflix puts the company before himselfherself and is encouraged to voice his or her opinion Our CEO Reed Hastings happens to be one of the most brilliant and innovative leaders of the industry and he always has an open door policy to his employees,It is extremely focused on the culture of its people This is not exactly a downside but to certain individuals who are used to a structured corporate environment this may not be the right place for them,nan,Current Employee,Beverly Hills CA,Nov 17 2008
30,Theres good and badjust like anywhere else,,Great compensation Free snacks Free swag Very little red tape Lots of smart people,Its something of a meatgrinder with lots of turnover Especially within the ITOperations organization Very little employee loyalty save for a select few Despite the supposed openness the company is full of egos and whiners Lots of m,IT Ops Dork,Current Employee,Los Gatos CA,Feb 15 2009
20,Employee BewareWorking for Netflix in Hillsboro Call Center,,The starting pay is competitive for what you do Fast growing company opportunity to be in the cutting edge some of the employee perks are great Empowered to do your job movies,Poor training environment felt like I was in grade school Management was high mighty unapproachable Over qualified and no oppurtunity for advancement High employee turn over 13 a week with about 320 employees at the center,nan,Current Employee,Hillsboro OR,Jul 1 2009
40,Networking Not Screwing Up Another Paycheck,,Pay for the qualifications is above average upper management does a pretty good job of taking executive initiatives not in sync with reality of call center at times and implementing them to meet goals with minimal moralrelated blowback given the abnormally lofty expectations at Los Gatos Opportunity to advance and stay challenged for a callcenter environment is above averagecatch 22 of this is listed below,In this company what you know and who you know go hand in hand Floor management is given independence to run their teams their way provided they hit goals and dont draw too far outside the lines This in some ways creates a public school environment Some teachers inspire their studentssome make them want to drop out entirely From the top down there is a constant but rather inconsistent level of pressure to perform or face termination When there is a lull in customer volume employees are given adequate time and support to develop their skillsif the volume spikes unexpectedly however external pressure related to the bottom line overrules and suddenly everyone in the center is under the guillotine again As an employee that has seen 80 of the center now 900 strong replaced with fresh meat in only a years time and a large number of those let go having equal or better performance than my own networking is key it is frustrating to see so much talent go to waste on a regular basis as a result of a supervisorsteam mangersdirectorscorp execs own stress to performorfaceasimilarfate mentality Going back to the Pros you can advance rapidly if you make people notice the positive things you do at the right time because every level in the hierarchy drops like flies,nan,Current Employee,Hillsboro OR,Aug 15 2011
50,Incredible Workplace,,Lots of interesting work Lots of opportunity to create new solutions Lots of incredible people Lots of money Lots of other perks Not political the best idea wins If you arent a great performer or dont have the constitution for honest feedback people calling you out not just on your technical skills but also on your emotional immaturity youll get fired,If you arent a great performer or dont have the constitution for honest feedback people calling you out not just on your technical skills but also on your emotional immaturity youll get fired,Anonymous Employee,Current Employee,Los Angeles CA,Mar 29 2014
50,Best job I ever had,,Dynamic fun environment with lots of thoughtful intelligent people Its possible to have a real impact on your field by innovating and moving fast HR supports employees with tough interpersonal challenges,When people know in their heart of hearts they are not a top performer they can be reactive defensive fatalistic and bitter Some resort to toxic behavior I wish they had the good sense to look for a more secure less demanding environment,Anonymous Employee,Current Employee,Los Gatos CA,Nov 4 2017
40,All in all a great place to work,,Benefits are terrific and I have my perfect shift Free movies are always wonderful This is the perfect job for me because it really is low stress and it is a perfect avenue for my love of film film history and general film knowledge,Lack of communication and inconsistency of management team Career opportunities are improving but not quickly enough Performance reviews have been a long time coming and still are not in place with compensation increases,Call Center Support Staff,Current Employee,Hillsboro OR,Aug 10 2008
10,Very good learning experience at a cost of a lot of heartache,,Pay and benefits They typically pay above scale and provide benefits from the time you become a full time employee,Management on several occasions missed their mark on several key initiatives in the center Specifically they never had a clue what was happening on the floor in regards to employee satisfaction and were never involved in developing employees to rank up Manage up or out was stated on several occasions and this approach is what developed a culture of fear in the call center High turnover is never a positive motivating factor and management was quick to let go of the people who stood against that ideal,Customer Service Supervisor III,Former Employee,Hillsboro OR,Dec 3 2012
50,ILoveMyJob,,Freedom and Responsibility is the fabric of the culture The mentality to be able to make changes and shift gears quickly allows us to execute in a manner that I have never experienced before in my previous companies The inherit trust allows me to grow and the feedback and candor allows teams to refine great ideas to execution We are treated like adults here and you are your own police,I dont have any major qualms other then a smaller detail that their isnt a gym on campus There is a discount for the gym across the street or access to another close to campus,Manager,Current Employee,Los Gatos CA,Oct 20 2015
10,If it sounds too good to be true it is,,If you are a young single person very early in your career you will get paid double what you would elsewhere and learn a lot from smart colleaguesjust be sure to get out while its your decision and before you burn out so you can take your knowledge and experience to a company with worklife balance,Read the reviews on here They are an accurate crosssection of experiences that show the reality of working at Netflix and how entirely it depends on your manager or who gets fired or promoted and suddenly becomes your manager You will have zero life outside of work and even if you are someone who could never imagine being considered anything other than a top performer let alone getting fired recognize that youyes youwill very likely be let go abruptly within your first yearsometimes in a matter of weekswith no opportunity to improve at the sole discretion of your manager who himherself may or may not be competent or honest Be sure that you can afford to live in whichever very expensive city you are relocating to with no income and are willing to explain a firing in your next job search Political backstabbing is the order of the day The meeting culture is horrendous and symptomatic of an organization that is growing too rapidly and clutching desperately to a culture that doesnt scale Ask anyone who has been at Netflix in a leadership or crossfunctional position and they will tell you that they spend their entire day in meetings and then spend all of their nights and weekends at home trying to actually get work done And finally if you do survive beyond the first year dont expect pay progression They will happily offer you more than whatever you are getting in your current position to bring you in and then leave your pay stagnant for years if you were already over market,Anonymous Employee,Former Employee,nan,Sep 11 2017
20,Good Developers but bad Company Culture,,As a senior developer you are working with a group of senior developers and developers are working together to get things done,As posted on Internet by Company Management Netflix DOES NOT treat employee as a member of family you have to be always prepared that your manager would let you go because 1 You did a great job and mission is complished so they dont have to keep you anymore 2 Your manager find a person better than you 3 Project did not work out smoothly developer is likely the one to be blamed,nan,Current Employee,Los Gatos CA,Mar 5 2010
40,Not perfect but definitely twothumbs up,,Netflix is a strong well run company Netflix pays well Netflix is in a highvalue service industry not affected by the rapid commoditization of tech Netflix business is immune to lowquality lowcost offshore knockoffs Netflix hires seasoned developers and pays for the experience unlike certain other companies that might be in the search business that only hire cheap junior engineers Netflix understands that employees have a life unlike certain other companies that might be in the search business,The average performance gets you a generous severance package policy is a little ambiguous and tends to leave one a bit paranoid this can a good thing Reluctance to hire promising junior engineers,Senior Software Engineer,Current Employee,Los Gatos CA,Jan 6 2009
10,Avoid Plenty of Fish in the Sea,,Inexpensive health insurance Unique work environment,Where do I start I am a highly educated sharp always employed individual and I found it very challenging to work for Netflix longterm Ive been employed in restaurant management accounting and retail just to name a few and this company was by far the worst place Ive ever worked At my youngest I was a Merry Maid and I even found that much more enjoyable then slaving away to constant surveys unintelligent callers and unrealistic expectations Forget about taking vacation embrace ocassional mandatory overtime Expect callers to personally threaten you and your family Schedules constantly change to odd hours no matter what your ranking in the center is Little or no promotion within I gladly chose to discontinue my employment with Netflix voluntarily and my quality of life has greatly improved,CSR2,Former Employee,Hillsboro OR,Nov 1 2013
30,Good short term job,,Can be a fun environment free mms and idea of the culture they want to create is nice,Like previously stated the culture is just an idea They push on being transparent but they themselves do not follow that Any time off is a joke There is not time available to be approved for PTO you get left with the option on calling it in in turn get punished Management can be very unprofessional with how they speak to their employees Culture and values are very clear and are open to what is expected as far as actually following it themselves not so much,Agent,Former Employee,nan,Oct 3 2016
20,Sucked The Life Out Of Me,,They had some awesome diversity and some really cool people working there They would do some nice things for employees from time to time Netflix swag parties pizza drinks and snacks etc The staff of the company who work the cafe inside is incredibly nice and fun They have a nap room and a game room that you can use at any time They provide trail mix fresh fruit coffee hot chocolate They also have a cafe and a small market on site,There is so much about this company that is just terrible The HR pays zero mind to privacy and gives personal health information to other employees Their attendance policy is an absolute joke as is their ridiculous policy about pens in the workplace You can’t have pens Or markers Crayons Paint Absolutely nothing you could write on or with They also attempt to pospos their problems away No matter what the issue or how frustrated their employees get they will never be understanding They will simply try and talk you into feeling differently and call it “being positive” Their system for handling escalations is a complete mess Hope you don’t mind having your already irate customers because at netflix it is always the internet’s or manufacturer’s problem on hold for 1520 minutes at a time while the poor CSR2’s try and handle a billion newbie questions hundreds of tickets for errors and taking supervisor calls Crazy to witness You switch managers ALL the time I had six in the year I worked there And there is no such thing as burned out at Netflix They push their employees relentlessly and brag about meeting a set of core values but they prove those values wrong every day I nearly walked out so many times because I was so unhappy there,Csr1,Former Employee,Salt Lake City UT,Dec 13 2018
30,Take What You Can Get,,Surrounded by qualitycompetent people Immediate health benefits Highest dvd plan No script Encourages employees to take initiative and is fairly open to allow employees to make judgment calls when where there are no definitive guidelines in place Supervisors are talented and empathic individuals with plenty of knowledge and support to offer,Monotonousrepetitive job Taking on average 80110 calls daily If you are not a talker this job wont pan out for you Upper management is generally ineffective and out of touch with the common CSR Guidelines and strategy are routinely changed with no clear purpose for the change,Customer Service Representative,Former Employee,Hillsboro OR,Jun 15 2010
50,Really great place to work,,The company has a really good philosophy about not imposing burdensome processes and rules It also treats people as adults and assumes everyone knows the best way to get their job done They are very good at communicating the current thinking of upper management and the current plan and focus and how they see the future Compensation is very good,There can be a high turnover People are let go frequently Can be a bit intense,Senior Software Engineer,Former Employee,Los Gatos CA,May 15 2012
10,Employees treated like a paper towel good for one use then throw away,,Higher that average pay for a call center Free food fun incentives Good benefits package,No job security what so ever Extreme lack of communication you can be told you are doing great 4 days in a row and then let go on the 5th Sickening climate of fear in this workplace Lack of respect and sensitivity during the let go proce,Customer Service Representative,Former Employee,Hillsboro OR,Apr 28 2010
30,Let us do our jobs,,Relaxed environment Dress code very comfortable Decent wage Beats the heck out of minimum wage Free account as long as you are employed,Too much pressure on AHT 55 minutes to relate converse and fix issues Not near enough Tech team needs to get their act together Can get 3 different answers to the same question Need more positive reinforcement Scare tactics make for constant turnover 3rd party call centerattendance policy very strict,Customer Service Representative,Current Employee,Las Vegas NV,Apr 23 2013

50,Never a lull in the action,,Fast paced environment The company seemed to really appreciate all employees no matter what level they were Benefits package was set up so that you pocketed some or all of the allotted money set aside for medical etc if you did not use it Too bad all medical insurance is not set up this way,Very early mornings on certain days but that was needed to make shipments arrive to customers quickly Having to leave early to make labor costs As a result a lot of work ended up being left for the salaried manager DVD rental side shrinking due to streaming,Operations Supervisor,Former Employee,Boise ID,Mar 7 2014
50,A leader who never never takes his eye off the ball,,You will be surrounded by brilliant competent mature hard working peers You will be challenged to exceed your past accomplishments Its a big company that strives to maintain a small company feel Office politics are 99 absent you are expected to focus on your work and you can expect from your peers that you will not be distracted by gossip or personality clashes Netflix is a place that is very aware of its culture and everyone inside works hard to maintain it Everybody you know outside of work loves Netflix and they will let you know when it comes up that you work there,Specific tactics will often seem opaque to newbies,Director,Current Employee,Los Gatos CA,Nov 16 2008
40,If you are dedicated to working hard and striving for excellence Netflix may be for you,,One of the main reasons I enjoy working for Netflix is that hard work and dedication are recognized and encouraged I have always been selfmotivated and dedicated to doing the best job possible With previous employers this has gone unnoticed and politics got in the way of career advancementThis is not the case with Netflix,You cannot come to work and have a lazy day You must be willing to give it your all each and every day I personally dont feel that this is much of a con However there are days where there is not enough time in the day to get everything you wanted accomplished,Team Manager,Current Employee,Hillsboro OR,Aug 13 2009

50,Great working environment,,Free Netflix for employees positive working environment you could watch TV in between taking calls All of the employees were friendly and management helped with outofhand customers,Rude customers calling youd have be highly patient Management really only focused on stats and some customers would ruin them if theres no way you could help with their technical issues when youre job is specifically to fix netflix related problems,Anonymous Employee,Former Employee,nan,Mar 17 2016
40,Great CEO a lot to learn there but some cultural flaws Worth working for,,You are part of a team that is at the leading edge of a cool entertainment paradym Reed Hastings the CEO is probably the CEO that I have most respected in my career and I feel he pretty consistently makes good decisions and moves the company in the correct direction Netflix has a very quantitative approach to almost everything including detailed user testing for their products so there is a lot to learn about that The other employees are generally cool people and fairly smart in general The user interface aspects of the website are strong so again there is a learning opportunity The company wide meetings are fun and entail good communication,In the website development group there is two week development cycle That means that there is a push to the website every two weeks This has a few consequences One is that there is a high percentage of overhead testing and release stuff compared to actual development time There is not much time for software design in such a scheme there is always a rush to hit the next two week time click Longer term projects are tougher to schedule and short term thinking dominates The performance policy is that anyone who if they quit would not be attempted to talk out if it should be fired preemptively a hair trigger threshold for firing basically This creates a chilling effect in my opinion I have seen fairly senior management that disagreed with their boss being farily apparently fired This creates a bit of a yes man environment something that Netflix would deny perhaps even to themselves There is very little empowement of employees in real decisions and decision making is very top down with the resulting motivation hit that entails,Senior Software Engineer,Current Employee,Los Gatos CA,Mar 9 2009
20,So much potential to be a great place to work too bad its not,,Decent hourly pay Use of the eight out at a time membership plan while employeed with Netflix Hand sanatizer readily available,In May 2009 Netflix took away sickvacation hours and provided employees an additional dollar an hour pay and then advised all employees to open up their own savings account to save for unexpected days off Netflix does not have a policy regarding sick days so as to hold it against you when you cannot make it to work even if you provide a doctors note In nine months I called out sick twice and still received warnings not to miss work Netflix promotes itself as striving to have the best customer service however has reduced its training too only two weeks One week in classroom and the next week on the floor taking calls The training is insufficiect which leads to inconsistency on the call center floor and the information which is relayed to customers The turn over rate is ridiculous I managed to work there for nine months before my part time shift was taken away and forced to go full time I was not able to work full time due to childcare needs and was told that either I take the shift I am given which is based on call volumes and business needs only or I can quit Netflix refused to work out a schedule that would let me keep my job there and work with their needs as well Netflix anticipates doing a shift bid every six months which means there is no gurantee you will be able to stay at the shift that you are hired for and no room for disscussion So if you have small children or attend school this is not a suitable job Netflix promotes a no policy policy environment which gives each individual team manager and leader to do as they see fit One day they will tell you you are doing a great job the next you will be let go Netflix call center fired employees for not being able to make it to work due to snowstorms that hit hard in December 2008 Roads were not plowed public transportation was not running and yet you were let go People were in accidents trying to get to work Others they put up in a hotel to make sure they would make their shift Netflix had random mandatory OT in some cases without any notice It wasnt just that they required a set amount of extra hours from everyone they only had specific hours in which had to be filled My husband had to take days off work so I could meet their required OT Again no flexiblity with regards to family needs Overall its just really sad because this job was and could be fun Its about movies and tv shows and all the great changes that are happening with the internet and instant streaming Still it is a call center and those jobs arent always the best however when the entire company is working so hard against their own employess the job is terrible Its not even something you can count on because you dont know when they will fire you and for what,Customer Service Representative,Former Employee,Hillsboro OR,Aug 7 2009

40,Great place to work,,The best thing about Netflix is the ability for every single person to have a significant impact on the business Each employee is given a huge piece of the business to own and we are allowed to make the right call with judgement There is a ton of flexibility and the lack of policies and procedures makes each person use their brain when making decision Netflix hires adults and treats them that way A very unique and challenging work place that acknowledges hard work and expects high performance,Expectations for employees are extremely high and everyone is extremely visable also a good thing too,Human Resources,Current Employee,Los Gatos CA,Jul 25 2008

50,If you get the chance work there,,The company gives employees a lot of autonomy to get your work done It values customer input numbers and data and rewards creativity It has a solid management team that has been at the company for many years and guided it through very turbulent times particularly the Blockbuster threat The company attracts smart and creative talent in its departments making it a good place to continue learning,This is a jewel of a company with little downsides Perhaps the kitchen could be better stocked with health foods but then everyone is not Google,nan,Former Employee,Los Gatos CA,Jul 15 2008

40,If you are lucky enough to get an offer from Netflix take it,,An unbelievable culture of honesty and bright people Self motivated people can have a great career experience Netflix is filled with mature adults that are not politically motivated Netflix management does a pretty good job of setting the proper context for employees and letting them run independently Employees enjoy a culture of freedom and responsibility that few other companies offer As an example we have no vacation policy you take what you need If you are excessive or not performing at a great level you will be called out on it If you are lucky enough to be offered a job at Netflix take it you won’t regret it You will be exposed to a company culture unlike another you have ever experienced,Not a great place to come if you don’t have a fair amount of experience We are not a great incubation center for people right out of college Health care and other benefits are not the best Netflix feels that it pays its employees well and that that will make up for these short comings not sure if that is 100 true in all cases There is a fair amount of career advancement available at the lower levels but it is pretty thin at the upper levels such as director vice president Not sure the pat at or above market value for employees is 100 true in all cases,Employee,Current Employee,Los Gatos CA,Feb 11 2009
50,Great summer job,,As much as the customers could be awful sometimes Netflix really tried to make us happy The supervisors were very hands on and always there to help My team of coworkers were very helpful too We were always in group chats discussing issues There were always contests going around and fresh fruits in the break rooms,The only con really is that you dont get to choose your hours You may get stuck with the overnight shift or working all weekend days They do pay you more for those hours though,Customer Service Representative,Former Employee,Portland OR,Aug 18 2014
30,Well ran company better call center,,Better pay than most call centers with a pretty good enviroment at the center itself Most of the team leaders are very solid The company itself is organized well and its great to work at a company that works Very merit based Overall one of the better call centers in the country I would guess,It is a call center and that is a huge downside due to the nature of the work The constant measurement of progress and high expectations can be stressful Time off is very difficult to imposssible to get off unless you plan months a head Currently there is no availble time off for the rest of the year The team managers my supervisors supervisors seem to be less compentent than many of the team supervisors No advancement outside of the call center and the advancement within the call center is pretty competative Also the company values of taking invoation from anywhere in the company is a little bit of BS I and others have made recomendations that dont leave the call center to corprate I have even been told by a team manager to not waste my time thinking of call drivers or to come up with ideas as people with advanced degrees are already doing that,Customer Service Representative,Current Employee,Hillsboro OR,Nov 17 2009

10,Like a good drama A flashy young company in a nice setting but with lots of tension under the surface,,Netflix has nice fancy offices in Los Gatos They have good snacks They pay a pretty high cash salary You get to claim that youre in the movie business,Netflix makes a big deal about their hiring policies They claim that they regularly evaluate employee performance and let the lowest performers go To me this sounded great In contrast to many other companies where lazy and incompetent people hang around for years Netflix tried to retain only the best and brightest people Unfortunately thats not what it was like in reality A week after I started at Netflix the recruiter who hired me was unceremoniously dismissed Then the tech support guy in our office was released Then an engineer on my team In each of these cases it wasnt clear what these folks had done wrong They had all been technically competent friendly and hard working This promoted a culture of fear where no one felt that their job was secure It turns out that there were several things going on Managers were given incentives to regularly purge employees So managers developed antagonistic relationships with employees In most normal companies a key responsibility of a manager is to defend their team in front of senior management At Netflix this just doesnt happen Additionally Netflix doesnt have adequate mechanisms for providing feedback and review to employees In the year I spent at Netflix I didnt receive a single review positive or negative Without a formal system for employee evaluation managers resort to picking favorites they hire in their friends and fire people who they arent friends with I saw this happen to many different people while I was at Netflix Its allowable by law everyone is an at will employee but it does not lead Netflix to hire and retain the best people Netflix has had the good fortune to be in an easy business They moved early into online DVD rentals and have large cost advantages over potential rivals Their competitors Blockbuster Walmart etc took major missteps and were not really able to compete Netflix doesnt have to be the best at anything they do operations marketing movie recommendations etc They just have to be OK at these things to run a profitable business and they are only OK at them,Senior Software Engineer,Former Employee,Los Gatos CA,Apr 16 2009

40,I would probably still be at Netlfix if I hadnt returned to school,,I wanted to put in my two cents because unlike the other reviewers I had a mostly positive experience working at Netflix I was hired as a temporary worker during the summer and only left to go back to school The initial training was very good and it was easy to get help when needed on an ongoing basis I got regular useful feedback from my manager and my coworkers were also very helpful The pay was very good as a temporary employee I made 13 an hour and permanent employees get 14 min The benefits as a temp employee were also very good,All of my cons are due to the nature of the job and not Netflix itself Customers often get frustrated when calling tech support and they take it out on who they are talking you Ive done it myself I almost lost my voice a couple of times from talking so much but I didnt meet anyone else with that problem Most of the employees also worked evenings weekends or both because those are the highcallvolume times I personally worked swing shift Wed though Sun,Csr1,Former Employee,nan,Jul 5 2012
40,Some good some bad,,The people all tend to be very bright talented and hard working There is almost no deadwood Historically everyone made decisions based on the good of the company as a whole instead of what is good for their own teams The atmosphere was one of mutual respect Everyone knew everyone As the company grows it feels like that closeness respect and shared purpose is getting lost Still it is a good place to work in many ways The folks at the top are the best Ive ever worked for In the engineering departments everyone in management all the way up to the CEO is very technical You can explain anything to any of them without their eyes glazing over The fast pace means that you never get bored There is always some new interesting challenge In the nice to have category they have free lunches Many people complain about them but I always thought they were pretty good Theyll all provided by the same vendor though so its easy to get tired of them The buildings are nice enough It is easy to get whatever hardware software or gadget you think you need Topend Mac or Thinkpad with a giant display An extra desktop or two Whatever just put in a ticket and youll have it in a couple of days or sooner Need some nice servers for your project A couple hundred cloud instances Its all available with minimal fuss,When it comes to people Netflix is a throw away culture Most people last somewhere around two years before they leave or quit There seems to be no barriers to stop a manager from firing anyone that works for them If your manager likes you everything is peachy but if she doesnt like you for any reason at all youre quickly out the door A lot of time gets wasted by new people trying to figure out how a thing works or more often just ripping it out and creating something new since whoever built it is long gone Then these new people move on to the next company and the cycle starts again The high performance culture in practice means that there are very few useless people The downside is that you always know that your job is temporary and youre always worried that youll be fired Its a stressful way to live Netflix prides itself on being a nimble company It will occasionally do amazing things in a very short time period Deadlines can be crazy and they often dont take into account other work that needs to be done Projects dont replace the workload you already have they just add to it Many times youll deliver on a deadline only to find out that the work was unnecessary as someone decided to completely change the architecture or cancel the project completely Everyone is assumed to be available 24x7x365 Email is sent and replied to at all hours of all days and nights You can never let go of work Lastly the company philosophy is to pay employees and let them decide what to do with the money so there arent a ton of perqs for working there Benefits are okay but not great No real gym membership onsite masseuses or anything fancy The whole company used to go to Sundance every year payed for by Netflix but they stopped that some years ago,nan,Former Employee,nan,Apr 16 2011
20,Find a better place,,Good salary but even though u get few thousand moreit is not worth it,Interview process sucksReason I mention is that they take lot of pride in mentioning that if you are not star performer you may be shown the door My point is that if you can make good hiring process then you should not be talking about it in an interview HR is given unreasonable super power and they try to act as super smart for no reason They claim to give higher salaries as opposed to other bay area companies but that amount is nothing if you really compare with other companies I think any company which relies too much on HR for scaring candidates and keeping them in loop regarding performance of candidates is not a good company for engineers and that company is not the most coveted in bay area People are hard working but they are certainly not the smartest Some are smart as in any other company so I dont understand why they create so much of hooplah,Software Engineer,Current Employee,nan,Aug 11 2011

20,Be prepared for abusive directors and young untrained individuals,,Salary benefits stock options ownership,Netflix as a company constantly says it is a strong advocate for diversity and inclusion and do not tolerate “brilliant jerks” or bullies Unfortunately this is something that they talk about very often but when situations arises they would often side with the individual of higher rank In my 2 years at Netflix I’ve noticed that you don’t have to be the brightest and smartest person in the room to excel in this company you just have to be the loudest and made your presence known in meetings especially the high visibility ones Directors are often bullies and brilliant jerks somethings sans brilliant they are great at politicking and making themselves sound and look good The director I am working for for example often makes me solve director level problems When guidance is needed the answer we get very often is “not my problem” However if the problem was successfully solved they would be quick to claim the credit for it as the inspiration that lead the team to the breakthrough Netflix encourages weekly 11s with your cross functional partners and direct managersdirectors and encourages free sharing of ideas and respectful feedback during these sessions My director however for example would use these sessions to threaten the staff if too many questions were asked they would be threatened with termination Another issue is Netflix loves hiring very young professionals either fresh out of school or individuals on the second job Hiring of dynamic individuals is great however it is essential to provide young individuals with the necessary coaching to set them up for success especially when working in a high performance environment where once needs to excel and be able to separate professional and personal feelings No coaching is provided for these young professionally immature individuals on top of that they pay them a lot of money that probably warrants more than 10 years of experience What happens is that these young individuals develop an inflated ego play politics gossip and take everything too personally The lack of coaching and allowing them to run amok results in a very apparent bullying millennial mean girlsboys culture HR is very aware of these problems but employees are often told that they are working on it but nothing ever gets done In fact employees have stopped going to HR for any work issues because more than often HR would side with the upper management brand the victimized employee a “trouble employee” and eventually they will be let go And the reason given to the entire office for their dismissal is that they are no longer excelling in their work which most of the time is completely false It’s almost always politics and power play involved I have witness this happen to many times to so many of my brilliant hardworking and true stunning colleagues A few of these unfortunate colleagues were also told by HR upon being let go that even though they are aware of what is happening their hands are tied and they should just treat it as they are collateral damage How much you get paid also depends on who you know and how much you know how to “charm” your bosses and the leadership team I know of managers who are getting paid 3 x more than directors because they are great with charming their bosses How they determine how much each person gets paid does not depend on experience skill It depends on friendships and how well you sell yourself The money and benefits are great but they also come at a very high cost If you feel you are able to tolerate such an abusive environment then this is the company for you,Anonymous Employee,Former Employee,nan,Sep 20 2019

20,Netflix seems like a great company to work for at first,,Free subscription and the salary was competitive for the industry,Horrible hours the constant policy changes and lack of respect from management The nature of the job in itself was bad as the customer service reps are just there to be yelled at for promises that the marketing deptartment was constantly making with little thought as to how these features would actualy be implimented The other major issue is the lack of written rules or guidelines The foundation of their customer service is based on the judgement of each customer service rep The result is that there was no consistancy regarding the resolution of problems that arose In other words a customer could get one answer from one rep and a completely different answer the next time they call and talk to a different rep for the same problem,Customer Service Representative,Current Employee,nan,May 11 2009

10,Enter At Your Own Risk,,Free movies and interesting product,Hard to list them all This is a very difficult place to work especially if youre not tied to the Los Gatos office The average salaried employee was generally fired within a year or two and rather Darwinian reasons about competitiveness are generally cited as the reason It seemed like HR had way too much control of the overall operational decisions that were made and much of their decision making seemed to be based on behaviorbased psychological principles rather than project performance This company really needs to add some humanity into how they handle their employees,nan,Former Employee,nan,May 22 2009

20,Very disappointing,,As a customer service agent you earn around 1800€ per month lunch is provided however you pay 2 € for it per day and there is full travel cost reimbursement You get a voucher for your Netflix account,The employee surveillance is beyond good and evil there is a camera every couple of meters and you get an electronic key that you have to use where ever you go so every movement you make is tracked Although Netflix advertises itself as a company where you are encouraged to take responsibility and be innovative there is actually no trust whatsoever that they put in you You can only grow in this company if you sacrifice your dignity and act only in the companies interest There is an atmosphere created that doesnt allow you to be direct and open You can give feedback but dont expect that anything will happen or change to your benefit Youll be told That was great feedback thank you and then they keep following the companies agenda again There is no transparency from the top to the bottom and decisions are often made with no consideration of the preferences of the employees You will be expected to work different shifts and on weekends and you will see your weekend days being cut off when the schedule changes at the end of the month so be prepared to work more than 5 days in a row without compensation for the weekenddays they have stolen from you You pretty much dont have a life anymore If you face sexual harassment or verbal abuse from the customers over the phone which happens almost every day at least once you may get 5 minutes to calm down but there is no help provided for your mental health You really start feeling like youre not a human being but only a number that has to be optimized Most important thing if you consider working there Check the work law of the country so you know your rights Netflix seems to work a lot on their reputation but what they do inside the company is a shame,Customer Service Representative,Former Employee,Amsterdam,Dec 13 2018
