30,Sometimes good sometimes bad,Always had contests to make the work environment a great place to work I do not know if the stressful calls without much help for management is worth sticking around for the contests Seems like there is always a shift bid going on and the available shifts change dramatically within each 3 month period This makes it hard for people with kids You may get a 6am to 2pm shift one time and then company will get rid of that shift all together and depending on where you are in seniority or stats yuh could end up with a 4pm to midnight shift You just never know,nan,nan,Team Lead,Former Employee,Denver CO,June 15 2022

20,Tense and stressful workplace,Judging by the questions I’m assuming this doesn’t have to do with working on set for Netflix All I can say is out of the couple times I ended up working for Netflix specifically the last time the management was the worst out of any job I’ve ever worked The policies were absolutely ludicrous to the point where changes had to be made urgently in the middle of the project I wouldn’t care if they knew who wrote this,nan,nan,Production Assistant,Former Employee,Cleveland OH,March 18 2022
40,Dream job while youre useful,Disclaimer I was laid off as part of a reorganization 1 of 10 but I would have written the same review had I been the one who was spared In the 5 years that I worked at NF 4 first years were awesome I often felt elated I loved going to work both physically and then virtually due to COVID Mature caring colleagues interesting work lots of learning wonderful connections I joined when my team was in the startup phase and it was the best time for ideas and trying new things with no budget limitations Gradually over the course of the following 5 years the need to scale led to constant changes both of leadership and workflows Team leaders were being let go on average every 15 years if not sooner There was barely enough time to become good at what one does as yet another big reorgtitle change would come around Lastly the team came under the leadership of people who had absolutely no knowledge of the teams specialty but were experts in strategizing and optimizing processes Eventually it shifted from being peopledriven to processdriven from collegial to topdown The bottom line started winning over quality while business needs outweighed everything else Pros Awesome colleagues Productive work environment Top of market pay nice perks Lots of learning opportunities through constant change Cons Low job security Process driven vs people driven Constant change High level of ambiguity,nan,nan,Project Manager,Former Employee,Los Angeles CA,March 14 2022

30,Generally a decent place but turnover is high and work appreciation is low,I initially enjoyed working here but I noticed that sometimes you’re not appreciated for the work that you do well and instead you’re criticized for what you may not do well Scheduling and calendar management are major for assistants but they’ll also throw project work on you which is what a coordinator should be doing not an admin,nan,nan,Administrative Assistant,Former Employee,Los Angeles CA,February 4 2022
20,The over emphasis on DEI is maddening Their entire company is modeled around 1 percent of the population,Job security is zero Once your contract is up you need to reapply to work on another project Constant emphasis on inclusion and diversity makes it feel like that is the only reason the company exist And if you don’t agree of course you are not included,nan,nan,Artist,Current Employee,Burbank CA,January 29 2022
10,Sounds great from the outside totally different on the inside,Be ready to be worked into the dirt Theres no such thing as a worklife balance here Managers protect each other and act counter to the company culture then gaslight you by saying youre misinterpreting the culture Politics is the only way to get ahead and be ready to be passed up for promotions or more responsibilities by those who play the game better even if their work is terrible,nan,nan,Engineer,Current Employee,Los Angeles CA,December 16 2021

40,Good Compensation but Performance Culture leaves everyones job at risk,The Netflix call center is a decent place to work but I was just there at the wrong time Just after I was hired fulltime as a temp employee they instilled a hiring freeze meaning no one could be hired on by the company and get the promised benefits Then I was given a new supervisor and we didnt mesh very well After he fired me I learned that he himself was fired soon after,nan,nan,Customer Serfvice Representative,Former Employee,Hillsboro OR,November 20 2012

40,Great Benefits,Netflix overall is a great company to work for Great coworkers fast paced fun atmosphere The management does not have a clear direction for the center limiting growth opportunities The hardest part of the job is not having a clear goal to work toward,free lunches great benefits fun atmosphere,limited advancement unexperienced management staff,Team Lead,Current Employee,Santa Clara CA,November 8 2012
30,PARADOX Great management toxic culture remains,I worked at the call center which basically meant sitting at a phone for 10 hours a day I like customer service but didnt enjoy the repetitive scenario of the interaction I learned the keys to quality customer service messaging maintaining honesty and being positive without patronizing Occasionally though messaging that would be suggested by management would feel dishonest or deceptive despite the companys value of honesty The management was really great but the opportunities to move up were limited Turnover was high both from firing and quitting,quality goalfocused management,long hours repetitive tasks occasionally toxic culture,Customer Service Representative,Former Employee,Hillsboro Oregon,November 5 2012

50,Great place to work at especially when it was busy,Typical work week would be very busy Traveled about 90 of the year Out on Mondays and usually back by Fridays of the same week Work had to be done quickly due to daily production goals I learned that I had to work quickly and efficiently to achieve the company goal which is to get DVDs out on a timely manner everyday Coworkers were great Upper management were very knowledgeable in production but not in service so thats where the maintenance crew came in Hardest part of the job was the travel and having to have finished all the work required before coming home or else I dont come home until the job was done Not usually an issue with me cause I always get the job done The most enjoyable part of the job was that there was always a challenge No two day were the same and I was always upj for anything,nan,nan,Operations Equipment Technician,Former Employee,San Jose CA,October 11 2012
40,Very great work place with game room and ping pong tables,a typical day at work is making sure we help all the customers with their tech issues I learned how to be an even greater customer service rep because the management was great as well as the coworkers The hardest part is trying every solution to the issue and not resolving it because you tryed your best and getting the job done helping the customer find the solution and getting great feedback from the customers has to be the most enjoyable part,nan,nan,Customer Service Tech Support,Former Employee,Las Vegas NV,September 27 2012

30,NO vacation or holiday pay weird hours Discourage time off,Managment is very deceiving takes weeks to get an answer out of them IF you get an answer at all Coworkers dont really care about anyone but themselves Its a very alienable shop They dont encourage comraderie with coworkers in fact they prefer that you just come in do your job and dont really talk to anyone especially shop talk The hardest part of the job is most people have split weekends and God forbid if you request time off They consider it the same as if you called in sick They hold any little thing against you permanently Managment has very high turnover The most enjoyable part of the job unfortunately is payday,nan,nan,Route Driver,Former Employee,Minneapolis MN,August 20 2012

10,Without a doubt the worst job Ive ever had,The only way to succeed at Netflix is if you have the knack for making sleazy exploitative policies sound less objectionable than they really are In Netflix culture this is referred to as positive positioning but the majority of customers correctly interpret it as trying to make the people youve ripped off feel good about being separated from their money In order to hang onto your job you need to consistently meet a set of metrics including AHT and customer satisfaction rate that can change arbitrarily at any time Customer satisfaction is determined by a onequestion survey issued at the conclusion of each call which asks only whether the customer was satisfied with their experience with Netflix No distinction is made between the company and the rep so even if you did your level best to assist the customer you can still be rated unsatisfactory if theyre upset about a price hike or something else thats entirely out of your control The turnover rate is unbelievably high there is nothing resembling job security and if youre a temptohire your conversion which comes with a pay increase and health benefits can be continually delayed for virtually no reason Also a lot of the customers are outrageously rude and hostile and theres nothing you can do about it,nan,nan,Customer service representative,Former Employee,Hillsboro OR,July 18 2012
20,Too much turnover,Wasnt to fond of this place to be honest The working environment was unconventional I learned that I never want to work shifts other than 1st The hardest part was having to be there at 3am Monday Friday however there was one thing that I got satisfaction out of and that was when they allowed me to implement an exercise program to take place at the head of each hour to keep the employees awake and limber,nan,nan,Quality AssuranceControl,Former Employee,Minneapolis MN,July 12 2012
20,Great and fun place to work,A typical day working here is helping customers and checking in delivery orders Working here I learned how to make liquor orders and help customers better Management was nix and very helpful and so was the coworkers The hardest part of the job was sometimes the rude customers The most enjoyable part was laughin and talkin with the customers,nan,nan,Customer Service Representative,Former Employee,Farmington Hills MI,July 6 2012
30,Used to be great eroding culture,I joined Netflix 3 years ago right before COVID I enjoyed working thereculture was great the best colleagues and worked on really hard challenging but fulfilling projects Sadly with the rising competition and immense growth the culture of the company has shifted extensively HR does little to address issues with regards to compensation and performance Marketing org is a mess with 3 CMO changes during my tenure,nan,nan,Asset Operations,Former Employee,Singapore,March 22 2023
20,Productive and experiencing workplace,A typical day at work is coming in signing in my phone and computer and start taking calls My coworkers were very helpful and always answered any questions I had The hardest part of this job was sometimes the customers could be very rude The most enjoyable part of this job was helping the customers fix their problems they were having with their service,the break rooms were nice and its a great place to work in,the pay wasnt that good for all that you had to do,Customer Service Representative,Former Employee,Farmington Hills MI,July 6 2012
30,Actively Downsizing,Netflix is a decent company They pay their employees fairly well However they are actively downsizing and management either never has any idea whats ahead or they dont plan ahead with the knowledge they do have If you can get in its an okay job for temporary needs but its probably not the place youll be able to build a career,decent starting pay free basic foods in the break rooms,downsizing clueless management slim to no advancement opportunities,Customer Service Specialist,Former Employee,Tigard OR,June 25 2012

40,interesting oppurtunity,It would be 1am and i would drink my coffee at work and get to coordinating each employee by my boss standards i received much disobediance but always got the job done I enjoyed playing ping pong during break and got the oppurtunity to meet several good individuals The times got hard and my coworkers got harder and im now excited for a new venture,nan,nan,Machine Operator 1,Former Employee,Salem OR,May 23 2012
10,A horrible working environment,Netflix treats their employees as completely disposable They seem to constantly be looking for reasons to fire any and all of their employees including supervisors Supposedly this sort of feardriven culture where working there a year is considered being a veteran which is absurd will give Netflix customers better service I dont believe it does When call volume drops employees get laid off When call volume increases massive numbers of people are hired and employees are sometimes forced to work overtime Everyone is temptohire to make the firing of virtually all employees easier Only senior management lasts at Netflix,nan,nan,Customer Service Representative,Former Employee,Hillsboro OR,May 22 2012

20,Human Shield vs the meat grinder,It takes an half an hour to an hour just to get to the center You must be logged in and ready on the exact moment when your shift starts Should you need too use the bathroom other than your 10 minute break it would found aggenst your availability which is 5 min total per day out of the Q If that happens you can be written up or terminated 95 of the customers hate the service therefore dont like you no matter what and remark you down on the survey too many bad marks and you will be written up or terminated Supervisors have the same metrics for the whole team so they have to watch out for themselves This job payed well for having to sit around all day however it was the worst experience ever I left everyday hating my life When your company hates you and the customers hate you for things you cannot control such as price change internet bandwidth fluctuations and shipping issues seriously Everyone puts on a happy face but after work discussions from any position lets on the same experience I am bring to convey above,nan,nan,Customer Account Representative,Former Employee,hillsboro oregon,April 9 2012
