20,Poor worklife balance toxic company culture,,Boise is a great place to work and the semiconductor industry is very interesting,Micron has a toxic company culture with bad worklife balance The company is very internationally distributed now so expect to work in both the US and Asia times zones simultaneously This typically means 60 hours a week minimum Additionally the company culture is very cutthroat and employees will frequently undercut and sabotage each other in order to protect their jobs As a result there is very little team cohesion and camaraderie,Data Scientist,Former Employee,Boise ID,Mar 18 2023

30,Not the worst but the culture kinda sucks,,Interesting technical problems some really great engineers and people Boise is a fairly nice city especially if you bought your house awhile ago a strong and experienced manager can make a huge difference protecting from much of the BS from above,Biggest problem here is that the company loves managers more than engineers Much easier to climb the ladder and get more money by turning into a manager than by being a technically competent engineer who is respected by their peers The company is filled with layers and layers of management Another big problem is the current CEO’s very heavyhanded topdown approach Managers and directors often have little room to apply their own discretion Stacked rankings and restrictive WFH policies are evidence The reward loyalty with meager raises at least in Boise Corporate believes that people won’t uproot their lives by leaving Idaho to change jobs so they skimp on the perks,Principal Engineer,Former Employee,nan,Feb 10 2023

50,Has made great strides,,The company has improved markedly over the past 10 years While there is still costcutting during downturns there is less kneejerk cost cutting The company is now leading the industry instead of being the perpetual laggard and has a healthy profit margin and cash flow Sanjay and his team has done a good job with this transformation There is more focus on worklife balance and on employee satisfaction and feedback as well which is positive and real pressure is being applied on departments that are lagging in either Some departments suffer from a dogeatdog culture of toxic politics and constant scheming kingdombuilding and maneuvering rather than collaboration Other departments truly work as a team everyone pulling in the same direction The good news is that being a large company there is generally an opportunity to move to a differentbetter department if your current one is not a good fit,Your experience will still to a very large degree depend on your managers and your VP My experience with different departments has been day and night so make sure to ask employees in the department youre planning on joining for their honest feedback While there is much more focus on worklife balance and employee satisfaction there are still departments that are largely either unable or unwilling to improve either Some departments are very spread out geographically which drives a lot of meetings at night for US employees when having to collaborate with Asia and often you will also have meetings early in the morning bookending a very long workday There is often some flexibility to take some time off during the day but that will largely depend on your local management again your experience will be entirely dependent on your immediate managers and the VP and how they decide to run things Same goes for the work culture as mentioned some departments have a very toxic culture of political scheming other truly collaborate and pulltogether again your experience will be very different depending on where you are,Manager,Current Employee,Boise ID,Dec 17 2022

30,good stuff,,there is always lots of food,there is never any beer,Software Engineer,Current Employee,Boise ID,Oct 30 2022
20,Leadership changes needed,,Some good people at the engineering level Advanced Memory Technology,There are obviously good aspects of Micron but the negative far exceeds the positive When I joined Micron the 1st 6 months were your typical “honeymoon” period where upper management treated people with some respect At the same time living in Boise for the first time all I heard from people throughout the city and local county is that Micron is not a favorable place to work After about 10 months or so is where I finally started to see where the negativity was coming from I want to highlight 7 key items that many who work or have worked at Micron can relate to 1 Since Micron is based in Boise there are no other tech companies around Due to this fact upper management knows that they have the upper hand on people that want to stay in the area They can demote embarrass or move you to another department and the employee will have no choice but to accept This does not happen in the Bay area because you have so many other opportunities and good people can go anywhere they like 2 Micron hires experienced engineers from other companies’ primary that have NVM NAND experience They essentially just drain the knowledge out of them and then treat them as stated above and then just go through the same cycle over and over again This is well documented in many articles where people have stated that Micron hires their competitors and use all their knowledge However their technical leadership team that has been there for more than 15 years takes all the credit for all the outsiders tech innovation Recently Micron has experienced a large attrition compared to most tech companies Some departments lost over 50 of their employees because of poor working conditions such as forcing engineers to work onsite 100 of the time AND travel to Asia during COVID in 2020 and 2021 3 Upper leadership only cares about the employee survey Some of the management requests that you have a premeetings with your employee so you can understand the questions of the survey and make sure to have a positive outlook on the company The last time I checked a survey should be taken by the employee without any outside bias influence When the survey results are low they start pointing fault to the working class engineers They say the survey is anonymous but we all know that is not true AsiaSingapore surveys for Micron do very well because they are forced to check the positive boxes or else there will be consequences Micron claims diversity and inclusion but that is not evident at all 4 If you want to succeed in Micron’s Technology Department you have to be in 2 categories 1You need to kiss up and be in the right group 2 In engineering meetings you better just start asking questions or as management states “you must make noise” because if you don’t then you don’t understand the technology” Many people that work at Micron can relate to this type of the person in a meeting that always says “Oh wait can you go back 2 slides……uh uh that slide makes no sense uh yeah I dont understand…this probably happens in EVERY meeting A great CEO once told me that the ones that speak the least most of the time are the ones that do the actual work At Micron just speak the loudest and ask the most irrelevant questions in a meeting so that others think you are engaged but really have no idea what you are talking about and you will do just fine 5 I had a manager that came to Micron that worked at a couple of other tech companies and he was probably the most knowledgeable in his field Yet management treated him and our team so poorly that most of us left He brought a sense of humor cared for everyone in the group and mentored all of us At the end our modules surpassed the previous 2 tech nodes but we were not part of the click group Remember employees have no other place to go in Boise right 6 The good thing about COVID is that it brought an option of remote work including opening the doors for experienced engineers to work in a variety of other fields and companies throughout different states In addition it exposed Micron on their overall compensation for employees People on reviews claim that Micron compensates well but most of these employees have only worked for Micron Micron’s competitors pay far more “overall” compensation 7 Finally I have to say that Micron’s sense of management reporting is by far the worst in the semiconductor industry Many Boise technology employees report to AsiaSingapore management and are reviewed by their management Micron also moves some of their most inexperienced engineers in into the most difficult technology orgs and puts them in charge I guess that is not a problem because the real people doing the work will be other that were brought over from the competitor companies Remember if you worked at Micron for over 15 years and are in the click group you will be taken care of That means others that were hired from other companies or even new college graduates will get the low rating at the end of the year The statement “employees don’t leave companies they leave toxic cultures” is not entirely true but over the last several years at Micron that has been the case I would suggest that you look to see who is in charge and for how long at Micron The elitist take care of themselves and keep themselves in power and that is a large part of Micron Ask how attrition has been…if they state “normal just like the industry” that is a bold face lie There are so many other companies out there and I would highly suggest that Micron be at the bottom of the semiconductor list If upper management does not get weeded out soon at Micron the same cycle will continue and Micron will truly take the top of the “toxic culture” work title Poor leadership Innovation primarily comes from copying competitors and hiring their employees Average to low compensation False employee

40,Great place to work but could use some improvements,,Reasonable worklife balance good benefits and the company weathers economic downturns well no layoffs during the 2009 Recession or the 2020 Pandemic The new CEO highly values diversity and allyship in the workplace and all employees are required to take ally training held by the various Employee Resource Groups The work is extremely fast paced as any issues with the manufacturing line need to be fixed ASAP I personally find that this makes the job interesting and fulfilling but it does mean that the job quickly swings between relaxed and highstress Thankfully it is relaxed more often than not,There is no hybrid Work From Home at this site for nonmanufacturing job roles despite good WFH performance during the Pandemic This decision seemed to come from the executive level without feedback from engineering teams The Manassas site focuses on legacy part types meaning there arent a lot of highlevel engineering positions available for growth opportunities no RD A few small complaints The site looks and feels dated with cubicle walls that have been there for at least 25 years The old cafeteria was converted into more cleanroom space meaning the current cafeteria is in a large trailer The food on site isnt particularly good and costs a lot There is a small gated outdoor patio to eat lunch on but if you want to go outside for a walk to take a quick break from work you need to exit and enter through security Perhaps they could expand the gate around the building to enable access and more walking space,Real Time Defect Analysis Engineer,Current Employee,Manassas VA,Jul 7 2021

30,Interesting Company to work with,,1 Overall compensation is very competitive to other companies within the industry but this comes with a reason God will not get you free lunch anyway You will have to expect long working hours But good news is when an existing teammember resigned or left usually business will find 23 additional headcount to backfill the position so this is a good news for the existing teammember 2 As an employee you do not need to have a skills and experiences for the role if you have the correct attribute have an excellent communication skills and demonstrate a great networking and business acumen it will be easy for you to get promoted level to level within 6 months 3 IMHO this company has min office politic cos everyone will have to integrate their life into work if you find someone playing politics obviously that is the position you should consider JOP if you aim for work life balance,1 GPTW in my opinion is only applicable to some businessdepartment cos there is a group of people really need to sell their life health to have the majority to vote the company for a GPTW Just like OSCAR audience will only know how talented are for the acting crew how many people really appreciate the crew behind the scene 2 If you are hardworking type but do not demonstrate that you have a excellent communication skills networking is average and you probably need to look for alternative path unless you decided to retire doing the same job till age 67 3 Leaders does talk about career development with you but 80 of them are an armchair strategist you have to be lucky enough if you can meet the other 20 So the advice is JOP until you found the 20 else you will ending up retired doing the same thing till 67,Recruiter,Former Employee,nan,Mar 28 2022

10,Thinking of working for Micron read here,,They make good attempts to reach from the corporate level down to the bottom of the organizations at the different sites to get feedback and make policy or benefits changes I like that they try to engage The benefits are good,Pay is noncompetitive to the rest of the industry They are ok being last in pay If you are new or are accepting an offer from a Micron recruiter just know you are being paid the bottom of your pay level and less than people at other companies in the same job They make no attempt to retain any talent Middle management at the Virginia site actively promotes based on nepotism versus skill ability value or qualifications across all organizations Attrition rates at the site are probably the worst in the Micron network of FABs over the last couple years They lose more people than they can hire each month for years now They are reaching critical staffing issues Ive heard managers openly brag about denying raises and promotions to get people to quit The common phrase when I find out someone left coming from managers is the problem isnt us its they arent a good fit here Theres no HR presence here mangers can do any unethical thing here and its never followed up on and its their word over anything Any feedback given faces immediate retaliation to sink a persons career if a manager finds out so no one wants to give feedback on company surveys they actually coach the departments on filling out the corporate surveys that its needs to be positiveand they tell their direct reports they can read all comments given and know who made them I would not recommend anyone looking in this industry to work for Micron if youre looking to be a process technician process engineer or on the equipment side Really any other company you will get more out of the experience and treated better Every company has downsides so theres not always a grass is greener thing but I dont understand why let your management be so toxic when theres such a shortage of people in the industry If youre looking for quick industry experience and youre a new engineer just plan on a 1 or 2year plan to get some experience and then leave as quick as you can this is not where you want to have a career at After all the years Ive given to Micron Im embarrassed to say I work for them I have begun to look elsewhere I cant keep witnessing whats going on and continue to work for a place that has no values Im not angry at Micron just sad because theres no reason for a business to operate that way If you know someone that is or used to work for Micronthey will just say yeah its just the Micron way,Senior Engineer,Current Employee,nan,Mar 26 2022

10,Micron not a great place to work,,Benefits seem competitive on the outside Further inspection is required to see through the façade,Decision making is made at a much to high level Managers are not allowed to make decisions for their team and are handcuffed to corporate dictatorship Example during Covid certain roles were forced to be onsite even if their responsibilities have been demonstrated to have no impact due to working from home And MANY other examples Software rollouts for Microns operations are EXCESSIVELY buggy and do not work as intended The running joke is that the end users are the beta testers The legacy systems are deactivated and end users are forced to deal with the new nonoperational software Restrictions on the IT front are rampant Many tracking policies are put in place and most permission policies are super intrusive and inhibitive Many individuals have to spend more time covering their butts than doing their job They spend more time asking permission to do things and placing the blame if something goes wrong on others than innovating and problem solving This is how the management operates if an individual makes a mistake the management slams the door on their hands This stifles innovation and creates a workplace governed by fear,Equipment Engineer,Current Employee,Lehi UT,May 25 2021

30,Micron Engineering,,The most positive aspect of working at Micron is that the Semiconductor Manufacturing Industry is an interesting work environment for all disciplines of engineering There is a large variety of systems and processes which require curious technical people to maintain troubleshoot and upgrade Memory chip technology improves every 12 months so change is constant If you like change you will love it,Despite their superficial efforts Management has never been able to make people feel valued Sure they love to say people are our most valuable resource but dont demonstrate it Everyone working at Micron knows that the factories processing machines and raw materials cost billions and are really the most valuable assets To make things worse Micron has recently adopted a forcedranking performance management system that forces managers to use the full distribution of ratings 1 through 5 during yearly performance reviews This is like the old GE system of terminating 10 of the workforce every year to create turnover There are many experienced and talented employees at Micron and some groups are mostly comprised of these types This forces managers of those groups to artificially rate people high and low This leads to employees distrusting the process and Management and reduces collaboration due to internal team competition Please note that Micron Top Management would claim that what Im saying about the forcedranking is not true but Ive talked with a number of midlevel managers off the record and theyve confirmed it,Mechanical Engineer,Current Employee,Manassas VA,Dec 26 2021

10,Job satisfaction and company culture SPC OOC,,Benefits are good Especially the timeoff which is imperative for maintaining ones sanity at this place Pay is lower than industry average partly bc of the lack of job market competition in the Boise area,Shift work by its nature is tedious repetitive and mindnumbing Add to that the pain of rotating to night shifts every 4 months and the conditions for a soulsapping corporate cog job are created Indeed there are opportunities to move off of shift But somehow being a process owner working 5060 hoursweek and being oncall 247 does not sound much better The shift crews also have many stars and stripes goodold boy types that somehow gained the title of engineer without a real engineering degree If you wish to be surrounded by Trump supporters with myopic perspectives of the world shift might be for you The work environment became hostile in OctNov 2018 when the performancebased softlayoffs occurred I performed well and benefitted but many folks who performed equally as well were rated lower and paid the price I cannot help but feel some level of guilt even if these things are beyond my control The consequences of this rating system will eventually take its toll on this company Some areas are even identifying and holding onto their 1s and 2s now so they can ax them come performance review time How on earth is this indicative of the tenacious and peoplebased culture that leadership continues to extoll I think now is a good time to GTFO of Micron,Shift Process Engineer,Former Employee,Boise ID,Jan 30 2019

20,Leadership needs a PIP,,I have been fortunate to work with the most guenuine intelligent and dedicated people so far in my career People are willing to help and want to see each other and Micron succeed Benefits compensation and time off seem to be commensurate with other large organizations There are a lot opportunities to improve and contribute at Micron,Culture is becoming toxic driven by low moral lack of job security decisions made in vacuumes and poor communication from leadership Some areas still operate like a “good ‘ol boy” network Company culture is cheaper is better changing Status quo is good enough in a lot of areas,Anonymous Employee,Current Employee,nan,Jan 23 2019
30,Recent changes bearing downward pressure on morale,,Interesting work Opportunities to advance if in the right departments Recent emphasis on worklife balance Workplace amenities for those interested in them cafeterias gyms onsite healthcare Good benefits Compensation is generally reasonable can depend on department con,Recent bell curve ratings is causing morale problems works against stated values of people and collaboration the system assumes that someone who has worked up to engineer 4 for example and who is rated in the lowest 23 of E4s is not a valuable employee and needs to get their act together or find employment somewhere else devalues experience and aggregate knowledge Communication has become condescending when addressing changes which employees might consider other than positive Leadership can come across as out of touch Opportunities for advancement and salary adjustment can vary by department,Engineer,Current Employee,Boise ID,Feb 22 2019
50,I love working at Micron,,Such a huge difference when Sanjay Mehrotra and former Sandisk executives joined Micron We have seen a change in culture and focus I like the direction we are heading I feel our executives truly care about their employees We have transparency with leadership team great culture programs that enable professional development and advancement Coworkers are friendly Biggest thing for me is that I feel like the work I do makes a positive difference to people and to the world in general,Making a lot of progress but still a lot of work to do with diversity and inclusion especially in the area of women in leadership roles Other con is that decisions are not always made at the appropriate levels still work to do with empowering lower level managers and team members to make decisions,Senior Business Development Manager,Current Employee,Folsom CA,Jun 11 2019

30,Good place to gain initial experience but it can be difficult to further your career after that,,Talented and driven individuals compose the workforce at Micron The company seems to currently be going though a transformation phase Upper Management is actively focusing on improving on the various industry benchmarks where Micron lags behind the competition They also understand the importance of moving away from a highly commoditized business model sell a ton of generic memory and into an style of business than caters more specifically to the customers solutions If you want to move to Boise Company HQs you will love the city no traffic mild winters no pollution plenty of outdoor recreation and much lower costs of living than the traditional high techs meccas Silicon valley etc I consider living here a much higher standard of living than in crowded and overpriced Northern Cal,Like all large companies bureaucracies can form that slow down progress The company has a very talented pool of employees but the disjointed way in which different departments sometimes function can act as a hindrance to innovation There seems to be a proliferation of empires built by middle managers Career development opportunities can be scarce Lateral moves are available but it can be challenging to find an opportunity to move up in the company,Engineer,Current Employee,Boise ID,Jan 16 2014

10,Dissatisfied,,Relocation package is fairly solid if they are still offering it Manassass is a fairly safe city to raise a family in Opportunity for experience in 300mm fabrication,Working your normal scheduled hours was not enough until they cut overtime at which point working more than your scheduled hours was excessive Promotions are nonexistent I worked there for nearly four years with no promotion or even a raise Market surveys for pay raises are a joke Comparing the area around DC with the midwest is hardly a fair comparison for wages and cost of living adjustments Management seems completely disconnected with the working class employees They only stick their noses in when they feel output isnt strong enough No recognition on the individual level when a job is well done Management rarely steps foot on the clean room floor How can you manage what you dont know Benefits were stripped away one by one during the downturn and are slow to return High turnover rate among technicians who are disgruntled about the lack of pay raises and promotions causing many shifts to be under staffed increasing the workload on already upset employees Cafeteria is not subsidized One meal can easily cost 800 or more if you dont bring your lunch and unless you are on 1st shift they frown on you leaving site to get lunch,Equipment Technician,Former Employee,Manassas VA,Nov 3 2010
40,Micron Values interesting and important work needs org infrastructure improvements,,Benefits compensation interesting and exciting work good industry international teams caring people and innovative culture,Organization structure too complex andor not current business decisions take too long or are too complex overcommitted teams policies and procedures are not centralized enough too many exceptions to the process across business units,Training Lead,Current Employee,Boise ID,Jul 18 2019

30,Engineer,,Just about every process is in need of improvement so theres lots of work for a LONG time There are 1100 sw systems that dont talk Its a company run by Excel spreadsheets not a positive,Wild West mentality Try telling a cowboy he needs a different saddle It doesnt go over well Working hard is embraced and working hard is scolded upon Actually thinking is scolded upon If you sit at your cube with a pencil in your hand looking at the wall thinking you will get funny looks as your not producing anything I would sum it up as the opposite of apple There are lots of people set in their ways and management is not committed to making the process more efficient and effective Heck the 16B company did not have a supply chain network up until 3 years ago,Anonymous Employee,Former Employee,Boise ID,Jan 29 2016
40,Good Job for Idaho,,Some specialized onsite training available Micron will pay for one or two job related college courses per semester after 1 year of service Descent pay for the Treasure Valley Descent paid time off earned each month 12 hour shifts alternate 3 and 4 working days each week allowing you to get your work done and have more days off during the week,Management tends to abuse the salaried or exempt individuals who hold less than a Masters Degree There is a severe disconnect between management and the little people working on the floor Often you will find that raises and promotions are temporarily suspended due to market conditions while the company reports a net 206M profit Semiconductor companies are cyclical,Equipment Technician,Current Employee,Boise ID,Dec 29 2015
40,Good first job to learn the ropes but its difficult to say if this is a company you want to make a career with,,My group at Micron is really fun to work in primarily because the team is knowledgeable and friendly and always tries to stay on the cutting edge Micron also offers great education benefits and you can really hope to advance yourself through this program that offers to pay for higher education as long as it is in the same technical area as your work,The heirarchy is relatively flat and therefore promotions are relatively difficult Also given the market conditions things like bonuses and perks are hard to come by since it seems like Micron loses more money than it makes It also seems like some of the other core groups are difficult to work with,Software Engineer,Current Employee,Boise ID,Dec 24 2008
30,Good place to work but promotion path is rocky at best,,Great paid time off system benefits are strong and it is hard to beat the starting salaries in Boise ID Enjoy working on complex problems and see recommendations get a serious consideration,Promotion path is not consistent between organizations within the company In one area you can be told by management that you will not get a promotion to a certain level because of your degree However move to another department and the game totally changes and you can get promoted This is two different areas in the same company The yearly survey is also a joke When you see a specific area review their experiences as poor year after year and having the lowest satisfaction scores compared to all other areas management needs to take a step back and try to change that path However management seems to not take the data to heart and attribute the low scores the a few grumpymembers,Process Engineer II,Current Employee,Boise ID,Mar 1 2015
50,Manager of Manufacturing,,Brilliant people Company cares about the employees This is demonstrated through their open door policy Each employee is welcome to approach any manager regardless of level and have a discussion concerning issues decisions changes and I never saw negative repercussions Management typically get back to the employee with a followup and to provide additional information around the concern I have seen decisions change when line level employees care enough to speak up and make management aware of the consequences of decisions or strategies,Tough industry to make a profit in,Manager of LED Product Manufacturing and Operations,Current Employee,Boise ID,Jan 24 2015
20,For what its worth,,Really good workers who are very competent both technically and functionally Good pay in the Treasure Valley with decent professional opportunities Good ability to take vacation when needed,There is a site access report that shows when employees badge in and badge out very mentally consuming to know that reports like this and the web surfing report are used to manage employees This is the easy way to manage instead how about managing by objectives or by deliverables and really understanding what employees are delivering in terms of value Challenges with flex schedules or working from home most management is not on board with this The work life balance is often challenged many salaried employees feel they have to work long hours 5060 hours per week too many conflicting priorities at times overly demanding workload while not truly taking into account the amount of workers required to accomplish something many efforts underway at any point in time some get done while sacrificing quality leading to employee frustrations this is hopefully changing,Business Analyst,Current Employee,Boise ID,Sep 17 2008
30,Micron is facing some tough challenges,,Semiconductor engineering is fun If you like working with semiconductors and are willing to put in the effort to learn new tools and methods then Micron is a place for you You need to like the outdoors more than you like bars though Idahoans arent bar hoppers they are more interested in campinghikingfishing than big city life,Managment is bloated and overweight This often makes getting things done quickly nearly impossible There are more than 4 layers of heirarchy in product engineering and development alone Unfortunately this bloated nature makes it hard to get promotions as well Also the DRAMFLASHIMAGER semiconductor field has become very commodity driven and suffers high peaks and deep valleys when looking at revenues Entering a downturn in the economy you dont want to be involved with this company as you are likely to be laid off,Product Engineer,Current Employee,Boise ID,Aug 16 2008
30,Global Recognition,,Micron is recognized as a global organization and should provide growth opportunities within the company After leaving the organization I was able to grow into a development role whereby Micron provided me a baseline as to the type of work environment that was not necessarily constructive for longterm employment,The organization or department where I had worked for over 20 years was shifted overseas however there was no real opportunity for myself to continue working for the company I was unable to find a growth opportunity for myself where I felt that I would be able to facilitate a career of interest for me Also I was restricted from being able to obtain assistance in expanding my knowledge base because tuition assistance was restricted or offered only if it applied to my current position at the company as opposed to helping me to expand into a slightly different career field,Manufacturing Engineer,Former Employee,Boise ID,Nov 4 2019
20,Growing dissatisfaction,,Decent salary and benefits Oncampus fitness center,The company is putting forth an enormous effort to force a culture change that does not match the region Different countries and cultures have different approachesattitudes towards work and their workplace What is successful in one part of the world does not necessarily work in another Employee concerns are filtered if not completely blocked before they reach a level of management that could have an effect Your voice will not be heard The upper management has a plan and is not concerned how you feel about it,Equipment Engineer,Current Employee,Boise ID,Jun 12 2019
30,Typical big tech company,,Good benefits decent mobility if you want to move internally pays better than most companies around Boise You can succeed if you work many hours and play politics well Some people fit well some dont so take it with a grain of salt,The usual big tech company fare pointless meetings BS politics evening calls read bad worklife balance lack of willingness to promote people in order to keep the balance sheet looking good performance reviews that may lead to firing seducing new college grads to join on cheap while pushing out the older expensive folks providing more jobs overseas for cheaper labor instead of domestic Microns new leadership wants the company to follow the Silicon Valley model which is great if youre in California with lots of tech jobs available Boise not so much Micron is basically Sandisk now with all of the new leadership in place,Product Engineer,Current Employee,Boise ID,Oct 1 2019
40,Product Engineer,,Relaxed dress code and very friendly coworkers Great place to learn new trades explore semiconductor industry and expat positions are always available There is a gym and yoga room on site if you need to relax during lunch or after work Coffee shop cafeteria and activity rooms ping pong mini basketball Foosball are also available to use during your breaks,Lots of work you may be asked to work weekends Working late is necessary sometimes its the only time to do work after answering emails and meetings with team members in Asia start at 6 or 7 Some managers can be micromanaging rude and may overload you with work whether its necessary or not There are great managers that know what really needs to be done and make it a great place to work but it all depends where you end up,nan,Former Employee,Boise ID,Sep 8 2016
10,Company doesnt make you feel valuable,,Good pay and benefits Flexible work schedule,Managers have no problem scheduling work on the weekend with no actual comp time policy World wide presence requires late hours in US for meetings creating horrible work life balance Managers like to make all the decisions and take credit for your work Too many Golden Children Managers dont like to listen to problems from the workers and come up with solutions Will not fight to keep talent offer more money than competitor Some departments are very slow to promote or advance your career You dont have any competition for hiring in Boise so they dont worry about treating you like a person just an asset They are becoming elitist and ageist driving recruitment from upper tier schools and removing experienced industry professionals for new college grads just to save a few bucks They are using a 5 point rating system so they can keep a constant flow of layoffs with the low rated employees without seeming like they ever let anyone go It has created an environment of fear among employees Managers have little leadership skills they are usually culled from the better engineers,Test Engineer,Current Employee,Boise ID,Jun 12 2019
30,Historically a good company in the midst of a radical cultural and structural changes,,Great people culturally diverse with good benefits,Divide and concur management approach Newer leadership does well to keep the team informed on core business execution requirements but is very secretive about specifics It is hard to be productive and feel good about how you are contributing to a winning team when the reality is that there is no such thing as job security,Anonymous Employee,Current Employee,Boise ID,Dec 2 2018
10,Test Probe Central Excellence,,The old school senior test engineers are truly excellent and reliable,Performance evaluation is unfair People say its a bell curve Well its not How could it be bell curve if the highest score you can get is 3 Then once something went wrong you got 2 and let go No matter how outstanding you perform youll get a three The department requires that every team needs to give a 2 to somebody no matter how well people perform What a sick rule Hard working subject matter experts who worked their butt off and got real work done receive average score like everybody else How will this motivate anybody Management has no interest in learning new technology and doesnt appreciate the innovation from their team They used to hire brilliant people from top universities Now newer folks mostly come from Boise State or some other unknown colleges in rural Idaho Why bother getting the sharp kids when turnover rate is so high Absolutely no worklife balance Working with technicians overseas is painful as heck as they have very minimal English fluency Cant get anything done but have to deal with it since Boise back end manufacturing was shut down,Anonymous Employee,Current Employee,Boise ID,Dec 13 2018

40,General Review Micron Technology,,Based on experience Micron does a very good job compensating employees competitively Lots of resources available including onsite gym clinic cafeterias and stretchmeditationactivity rooms Health benefits are excellent medical dental vision as well as matching 401k option Plenty of opportunities for career growth and plenty of encouragement to climb the ladder Micron also offers an education assistance program,Culturally the company is lagging compared to others in the tech industry Lots of oldschool personalities in leadership positions and a lack of willingness to embrace change and volatility which is a hindrance to competitiveness,Engineer,Current Employee,Boise ID,Sep 24 2017

40,Great place to start Great Benefits but Boise is boring,,The pay is pretty good and the benefits are amazing About 6 weeks of vacation a year The management is very good at treating new college recruits as equals You arent forced to work long hours 4045hr is average,There isnt a clear path to promotions The culture around campus is very boring Plain white walls no embellishments no fun The people in Boise are very conservative and sometimes very backwards,Characterization Engineer,Current Employee,Boise ID,Apr 25 2012

20,Innovation impaired,,The best thing about the company is the location and it keeps a lot of people here There are some great innovators and many are great about collaborating across organizational lines So many at Micron badly want to break away from being another commodity provider of DRAM and NAND There are career opportunities and growth possibilities,Micron is in an identity crisis not sure if it wants to fund system level and unique products or keep trying to execute as a commodity part supplier What that means is not executing any of these very well by spreading everyone too thin Many individuals dont understand new and different products and dont see the value so much of the time the innovative individuals have to work without support,Engineer,Current Employee,Boise ID,Feb 29 2016
40,Terrific company for someone wanting a gratifying career in a fantastic place to live and raise a family Idaho,,Micron offers great careers for people wanting to work for a fortune 500 company in a city where family and community still mean something Micron cares about its employees and layoffs are something done as an absolute last resort instead of what other companies are doing Micron is a place where I would recommend my kids working when they grow up and where I would be happy to retire if given the opportunity,Micron is slow to adopt change Working from home is discouraged and the management has poor leadership skills at a department level For example since a lot of the management has come up from production many managers watch the clock for professionals on salary and they treat their people like production line employees Many of the Managers have also come up from technical positions so their understanding of business is limited and their leadership skills are mediocre to poor Micron tends to think that technical expertise is more important than business andor leadership expertise so there isnt balance in the team skill sets Once these individuals are promoted to these roles many of them have an attitude that they are too busy or already know what they need Many never pursue additional training and classes Micron still tends to have a manufacturing focused mindset By this I mean We will build what is most efficient for us and the customers can buy what we build,Marketing Manager,Current Employee,Boise ID,Jan 18 2009
50,Great place to work,,I am very content to be where I am and think that Ive been treated fairly and compensated properly for my level,I wish telecommuting and summer flex hours were allowed Telecommuting would help keep people who can complete their job from home off the road and summer flex hours work four long days would give families more flexibility in vacationing and spending time with their kids,nan,Current Employee,Boise ID,Jan 16 2012

30,Red states are not great for women,,Top notch technology good benefits good general attitude Boise Idaho is a great place for men,For women I would seriously reconsider moving to boise idaho It is a small town that is stuck in the 1960s in terms of womens rights Women are accepted as 4 things stay at home wife teacher secretary nurse Thats it Much of this ideology is carried into the work place at micron I had coworkers make remarks such as I dont understand how people make a household work with two working parents that could be bad for the kids I also found that you get a lot of teasing and strange remarks that you dont get in larger more liberal cities Its also never a good idea to work for a company that is the only game in town but thats up to you,Yield Enhancement Engineer,Former Employee,Boise ID,Nov 9 2014

40,Talented people,,Micron has a lot of talented and smart people from all over the globe Even though this is company is headquartered in small Boise Idaho this is very much an international company with leading experts in their field,Micron looks at everything through a manufacturing lens which can make it difficult to expand beyond the core even into areas closely related to memory such as solid state storage,Anonymous Employee,Current Employee,Boise ID,Jul 30 2015

40,First job out of college Not too bad,,Micron is a good place to work from the career of a technician on up It is a fast paced workplace where you work with leading edge technology The training has been better now than it has been in the past Through goal setting Micron Technology steers its individuals to peak performance There are always opportunities to excel in your area as long as you are open minded and dont mind working overtime in order to complete extra projects Shift work from early morning to late at night is not too bad if you are in a position to get promoted to day shift you end up working 50 hours a week,Being an operator isnt that great because people look down upon you This job seems like if you screw up once you are gone if you are new but if you have been there for a long time you are kind of grand fathered in and a lot of low skilled poor performing employees end up staying in their positions as long as they are well liked Politics is a good chunk of your every day work schedule which i am sure that most jobs have their fair share of During todays troubling economy the workload is increasing and the staffing is decreasing,Process Engineer,Current Employee,Boise ID,Aug 19 2008

20,Easy job,,Easy work and great schedule shift work allows for 3 and four days off in a row Relaxed somewhat depending on your boss,the company starting to lay people off more often Your rating can make or break you depending on if your lead likes you or not Easy job but a lot of cry babies and backstabbers Culture has taken a turn for the worse in the past 34 years They are starting to make you really feel like you are just a number If you want to be successful in the company you have to make sure your lead gets along with you,Principal Technician,Current Employee,Manassas VA,Aug 1 2016
10,Record High Profits Record Low Morale,,Boise is a great town,Forced bell curve distribution rating system Senior management forces a 15 distribution of 1s and 2s and every group must adhere to this distribution 1s and 2s are then managed out Most 1s and 2s actually meet the rubric for a 3 but because of the forced distribution lower managers must let people go This has put morale at an all time low Team members no longer have careers but jobs Dont buy a house best rent if you plan on taking a job here,Member Of Technical Staff,Current Employee,Boise ID,Jan 8 2019

10,Work is fine but company culture doesnt exist,,Compensation lower premiums for health and other insurances Stock options are good It is possible to switch teams after some years of experience which is a good option for new graduates like me Training was good for my position in the initial 2 months which helped me to understand the big picture,There is no company culture at all There are many days in the office where I returned home without speaking to even one person I have made a fair effort to speak to many people and they seem uninterested People eat lunch in their cubicals and hardly speak to others I am feeling that this is a highly mechanical work environment where the human values are not valued at all I dont know if higher management is aware of this decay of ethos and culture in the company But I strongly feel that it is going to dent the company in longer run,Design Engineer,Current Employee,San Jose CA,Jul 2 2019
40,Micron Tech Producct lead Engineer,,Highly Techenical Teams Lot of opportunity to lean and acquire skills in multiple areas One of the best things about micorn in product engineering group is the ablility to interact with various groups and acquire a borad base of knoledge on workig s on various groups In a prooduc lead role you have a lot of resposibiluty in maing the product successful,Location of work Boise is a big negetive If you are not happy with the Job or your working spouse looses the Job your only optio is to relocate as there are very few options for Hitech workers Work culture is lot more structured and in flexible with hours,Product Lead Engineer,Current Employee,San Jose CA,Dec 1 2008

10,JUST TIRED OF THIS PLACE,,Good diversity Coworkers are good Located in Northern Virginia which is a very good place to have a life good weather good people and lots of things to do,Incompetent Management Poor compensation Compensation never changes for couple years and then they do a meager market adjustment They did not promote people for two years citing the recession and after that they promote only a handful of people in a month Sothats saying that in two years only a few employees out of the approx 1500 on the site deserved to be promoted And these are people who stuck with the company through pay cuts loss of bonus loss of 401K etc Now that number has gone down again You probably wont have a lot to do during the day but as long as you take 1012 hrs to do it management is pleased,Engineer,Current Employee,Manassas VA,Jan 25 2011
20,Bad Environment,,Good place to cut your teeth in the industry Thats about it,Really unhealthy environment a HUGE good old boys network that the company nor employees have been able to shake off Lots of nepotism cronyism and a culture of bullying The company constantly pushes employees to extremes with no reward system in place I can go on but you get the picture Micron is rotten at the core If you go there dont stay long Oh and it doesnt help that Idaho is what the company calls and reminds you of every chance they get a Right to Work state Which translates to Well fire you if you just look at us wrong,Yeah Right,Current Employee,Boise ID,Nov 17 2013
20,Ok with less than 1st place,,Making an effort to improve work life experience Competitive wages,Tech company whose leadership and their actions create a perception of being ok with anything less than 1st place And then demoralizing their work force with layoffs and major hits to compensation while personal expense costs soar This mode of operation is worse than shortsighted The only way to truly grow profitability of a tech company independently of market volatility is by embracing informed risk taking to innovate get the right people to lead develop and execute on producing disruptiverevolutionary technologies that wow customers The personal pride and feelings of accomplishment for contributing to the benefit of humanity is vastly motivational and wholly addictive Micron makes commodity items consisting of Memory and nothing else,nan,Former Employee,nan,Aug 26 2016
30,Great employer,,A lot friendly people lots of challenges room for career growth great compensation and benefits good vacation hours flexible work hours more relaxed environment compared to other tech companies,When youve become a senior engineer it then depends on who you know or where you work in order to rise through the ranks Sites where projects are run out of are Boise and Milipitas Folsom has become a support site to those,Senior Design Engineer,Current Employee,Folsom CA,Nov 16 2016
10,Wouldnt recommend unless you have no other options,,The pay is about average for the industry which translates into good compensation if youre in a low cost area like Boise If youre in a highcost area the salaries arent as competitive There are some truly good people working hard in the trench,1 Micron is turning into Sandisk v 20 There have been few internal promotions to executive levels since Sanjay took over with most new blood coming from Sandisk and almost all are are nonAmerican and have no clue about the culture in places like Idaho Utah or Virginia that culture is what made Micron a success and theyre killing it 2 The executive team the CSuite execs in particular are COMPLETELY disconnected from the operations of the company seem unaware of the low morale theyve created with the focus on their own wallets and power structures and present a garbled disjointed values system that is more marketing than a realistic plan to improve the soul of the company For example they espouse the value we care about our people while at the same time kicking team members out the back door 3 The new performance management scheme is a thinly veiled attempt to layoff 1015 of American workers every year for the next 57 years While unspoken its become apparent that Sanjay and his team have no respect for American workers Each year 1015 of workers will receive a failing performance grade and while theres an alleged path to redemption in actuality its nearly impossible for those workers to meet the arbitrary and unrealistic expectations defined in their performance improvement plan And since everyone is graded on a bell curve every year another group of workers will fall into the failing category and be fired This rankandyank system has been shown over and over in studies dating back to the 1980s that it lowers morale turns the job into a popularity contest lowers efficiency and just doesnt work The fact that its in use in 2019 shows a level of incompetence and ignorance from the executive team and doesnt engender a lot of trust among the hard working team members who make them successful I personally know of dozens of highly skilled workers who are no longer with the company because of this scheme 4 Continuing from 3 its obvious that Micron is trying to get away with performing layoffs without having to report that material information to the SEC shareholders and other stakeholders Its a legal requirement in the US that all workforce reductions above a certain percentage must be reported 5 Expect to work 24 hours a day 7 days a week including on vacations holidays while sick etc With all the terminations and resignations and with no backfilling of those positions being allowed each team is doing the same job with less and less labor The inevitable result of this is going to be more failing performance evaluations and more firings Its a vicious cycle that will see workers spending more and more hours on the job never quite catching up to the workload being told theyre failures and morale will continue to decline 6 While youre expected to be oncall 247 and available by phone remote connection or pager the company doesnt provide equipment beyond a cheap 80s era pager with which to communicate and even thats only 1 way communication With 10 billion in profit last year the least the company could do is provide cheap smart phones for all team members who are expected to act 247 in the case of an emergency 7 The CEO is using the tax breaks provided in the new 2017 tax law to make 10B in stock buybacks Even as market conditions deteriorate the exec team is stubbornly sticking to the buyback plan This goes completely against the alleged progressive values the company purports to support 8 Expect to have your priorities shifted on a regular basis often while in the middle of a project that was top priority just 2 weeks ago The companys strategic planning is nonexistent and often happens after the action period has already started For example its March 2019 6 months into the fiscal year and upper management is still deciding how to execute on the nonexistent strategic plan for the year Also everything is a top priority which means nothing is really a priority and this contributes to low morale and indecisiveness by team members and their departments 9 Departments often have objectives that conflict with other departments and often those conflicts are resolved by whichever VP can yell the loudest or who knows the most powerful CSuite exec Ive been in meetings where I spent an hour listening to VPs and Directors scream and cuss at each other and Ive even seen several people threatening violence Those people are still with the company and leads to my next point 10 Many upper management and executive level leaders use a management style reminiscent of 1980s era thinking Management by fear Management by negativity Management by impossible expectations Management by dictate Management by enforced cutthroat competitions among team members 11 The company is slowly shifting American workers to India expect to train your replacement if your department is one of those being offshored 12 The environment for a regular cubicle worker is terrible The lighting is bad people are packed in like sardines the decor is drab theres very little natural light and overall it doesnt contribute to happy healthy and productive workers 13 The mental health of a lot of workers is extremely compromised Combine a poor physical work environment with cutthroat survival competitions shifting priorities opaque direction from the executive team the fear of dropping into the bottom 15 the hostility from management towards midmanagement and frontline team members and their are a lot of people in a really bad place mentally and emotionally The company has offered mental health services to team members but its attacking the symptoms without touching the underlying root problems,Senior Manager,Current Employee,Boise ID,Mar 6 2019
20,Awesome Engineers HeadScratching Leadership,,Competitive salaries decent benefits highly competent peers not a lot of dead weight in my group opportunities for lateral career moves that come with a large company,Leadership at least in our org seemed to have trouble committing to a roadmap and product to develop and thus it felt like the rug was constantly being pulled out from under us and we were put in a position to fail time and time again This led to trust breakdowns between the engineering and business units,Storage Engineer,Former Employee,Longmont CO,Nov 28 2016
20,Midsized tech company on downward slide,,Micron Technology is an innovative semiconductor memory module maker If you are an semiconductor engineer there is opportunity to work with cutting edge Flash and DRAM technology,If you are not a semiconductor engineer your career will stagnate because of all of the proprietary software and technologiesskills not transferrable to anywhere else Plus the executive staff borders on the incompetent and the CEO is largely uninvolved in the company,Software Engineer,Former Employee,Boise ID,Jun 12 2008

40,A traditional American company that is working its way to be an international player,,I enjoyed the culture and am glad to see the top management are working on improving competitiveness and listening to employees Semiconductor industry is a tough industry with major players in Asia where there is no worklife balance so it makes more challenge for US company to compete,Depending on what group you are in and who are your managers the micro climate can be different Career advancement in manufactory for people with advanced degree is limited Sometimes there is too much red tapes but it is improving However the efficiency still needs to improve in order to compete with Asian players,Senior Process Engineer,Current Employee,Manassas VA,Feb 28 2013
30,Engineer,,One of the best employers in the area Reasonably flexible on schedule and work flow Some development opportunities,Promotion path is not clear at all and contains many hidden obstacles Many distraction factors at work and extremely crowded workplace Hidden informal relations are the only ways to get anything done otherwise normal procedure workflows are very slow and sometimes are intentionally difficult Immigration support is far from good I had to hire a lawyer myself,Process Engineer,Current Employee,Boise ID,Jun 23 2016
20,Frozen middle managers,,Good time off but it is so hectic nobody ever takes it Good pay for Boise,First line managers only have two skills make you work more hours or micro management From five years of experience I saw multiple divisions with the same problems people that were good at being and individual contributor were rewarded after “years of experience” with management jobs even though they were really bad at managing people,Senior Category Manager,Former Employee,Boise ID,Oct 20 2018
40,Good and Bad,,Great compensation for living in Idaho Couldnt ask for much better Lots of vacation time and management is generally pretty easy going regarding time off Micron will pay for college education and is very flexible with regards to class and work schedules,Communication from senior management is terrible although improving Micron isnt especially good at motivating employees in a positive way Pay scale for particular levels is a mystery management avoids the question like the plague Feedback for level advancement isnt always helpful generally very vague Level advancement requirements are really only loose guidelines and highly subjective,Manufacturing Engineer,Current Employee,nan,Jun 12 2008
40,Headed in the Right Direction,,Great Benefits Friendly coworkers Flexible hours for salary workers Most of the time the work is enjoyable The City of Boise is a pretty cool place to live,Only one building is actually pretty the rest are very barebones office style Though this is improving Occasionally work can become monotonous due to the cyclic nature of the industry No buses to work and its pretty much in the middle of nowhere,Product Engineer,Current Employee,Boise ID,Oct 12 2017
20,Great work horrible culture,,The work is great Every day is different Pay is decentish Immediate coworkers are great Majority of other people are great to work with,Management does not seem to know what is going on at the lowest levels Does not take advice from lower echelons at all Have been told by site managers as a group that if we dont like something to go find somewhere else to work The culture here due to recent changes in annual employee reviews has become a toxic pool of backstabbing,Eletronics Technician,Current Employee,Boise ID,Jun 12 2019
30,Volatile company in a commodity market with subpar compensation,,Micron is a fast paced environment on the leading edge of semiconductor technology which makes for an ever changing work environment The people are generally great to work with with few exceptions,Memory is a commodity despite the best efforts to classify it otherwise This makes Micron incredibly susceptible to some of the fundamental Econ 101 SupplyDemand dynamics and a very volatile business to be in And it doesnt help that compensation plans are not at all competitive in the high tech industry Tough to retain talent when you dont take care of your top performers,Anonymous Employee,Current Employee,nan,Jul 6 2016
20,The Culture and people message is a farse,,Pay is strong for the area and the benefits are good when they are not requiring you to use the benefits on the company’s timeline for example paid time off is being cut so we are required to take what we have during a specific time the company has given us If not we lose it,There has been a push in the last 2 years around making Micron the best company to work for Unfortunately this is truly about the numbers and not the people Staked ranking systems being pushed to work like Silicon Valley but not giving Silicon Valley pay and leadership driving team members to breaking points by pushing more and more initiatives on extremely short timelines The diverse workforce has a ways to go with women in top leadership roles still lacking The CEO talks of having women in those roles yet he has not hired a single woman VP to report to him The only woman that does was here before he arrived The culture has gotten so bad that many of the smartest and most loyal team members are leaving in alarmingly large numbers The reviews are getting so bad that we are being asked by leadership to go onto social media and say good things to try to bring up our numbers,Senior Program Manager,Current Employee,Boise ID,May 25 2019

20,Good for getting short term experience but not a long term relationship,,pay benefits team mates products,executives management HR long hours with no reward zero collaboration very siloed departments due to the new forced bell curve employee ranking which has been shown over and over to be ineffective no positive feedback on a job well done essentially everyone is watching out for their own paycheck,Finance Team Member,Former Employee,Boise ID,Jun 15 2019
30,Challenging work but compensation for an experienced individual is just not there,,Challenging work For the semiconductor field is not overly stressfull as I have been in the industry before and this field can be very high stress Interesting,Expect to not get any salary increase from what you have been hired by the company They do occaisonal market reviews that does not compare to the true semiconductor field competition In one wordmoney In two wordsmoney and management,Senior Equipment Technician,Current Employee,Manassas VA,Oct 3 2011
20,Watch the Industry,,Exceptional training decent benefits and pay Great technology development truly a learning atmosphere,As fears of a weaker market occur the company has knee jerk reactions where positions are overwhelmed with work the work life balance is sacrificed with no monetary incentive One might find themselves originally hired to specialize in one discipline only to be wearing several hats a year or two later where the quality of the job suffers to get everything done,Product Engineer,Current Employee,nan,Apr 13 2016

50,Micron is doing a lot of things very well,,If theres one word I could use to describe Micron it would be improvement Since its founding Micron leadership has been extremely focused on learning and getting better at everything we do Its amazing to see the change and refinement that has happened just in the past few years The culture of improvement permeates the whole company The size of the company provides a lot of opportunities for career changes and exposure to different fields of work When I started to realize the field of work I was in wasnt where I wanted to be in the long run there were a lot of options for broadening my horizons Microns education assistance was especially helpful Micron has a lot of locations but Boise has been a wonderful place for my family and me A lot of people here are transplants so theres a very open social scene among employees Boise is also a great place for outdoor recreation,Micron is in a volatile industry so it operates under a high level of risk About 10 of the workforce was laid off in 2007 and there were a similar number of layoffs about 5 years before that Having said that Micron has really gotten good at taking care of the people they lay off People I knew who were laid off were given generous severance packages and job placement assistance Micron gives its managers a lot of leeway within their areas so there can be some wide variance with regard to dress code hours worked etc Some areas are more relaxed but others will work you far too much in my opinion,Test Engineer,Current Employee,Boise ID,Jun 17 2008
50,Technical Writer,,This is the best company that Ive ever worked at They are committed to their employees and helping them progress in their careers They have an excellent training program Ive taken over 40 courses both in person and online Bonuses paid out twice a year for meeting site goals once a year for corporate goals,Due to shift requirements in a manufacturing company there is little flexibility for works schedules for everyone This applies to no fab workers too,Technical Writer,Current Employee,Manassas VA,Jun 12 2012

30,Good company but employees dont feel valued,,The most positive aspect of working at Micron is that the Semiconductor Manufacturing Industry is an interesting work environment for all disciplines of engineering There is a large variety of systems and processes which require curious technical people to maintain troubleshoot and upgrade Memory chip technology improves every 12 months so change is constant If you like change you will love it,Despite their superficial efforts Management has never been able to make people feel valued Sure they love to say people are our most valuable resource but dont demonstrate it Everyone working at Micron knows that the factories processing machines and raw materials cost billions and are really the most valuable assets To make things worse Micron has recently adopted a forcedranking performance management system that forces managers to use the full distribution of ratings 1 through 5 during yearly performance reviews This is like the old GE system of terminating 10 of the workforce every year to create turnover There are many experienced and talented employees at Micron and some groups are mostly comprised of these types This forces managers of those groups to artificially rate people high and low This leads to employees distrusting the process and Management and reduces collaboration due to internal team competition Please note that Micron Top Management would claim that what Im saying about the forcedranking is not true but Ive talked with a number of midlevel managers off the record and theyve confirmed it,Engineer,Current Employee,nan,Jun 30 2019
20,Good Engineers Working Under Draconian Policies,,Technically challenging work in may parts of the company Strong focus on design and product quality Reasonably good pay for the area Many longterm employees who feel comfortable with the culture,The company has been successful at making commodity components but lacks the ability to innovate across the organization The culture revolves around a production mentality equating contribution to the number of hours spent at the job Time at work is tracked for all employees including senior management This is often at the expense of actually performing any work Management in general does not see any need to improve believing the company is doing just fine,Engineer,Former Employee,Boise ID,Sep 14 2012
20,Good ol Boys Club,,Talented and hardworking team members the work is fastpaced but good if you like working in that type of environment compensation is reasonable for the area but still below national averages,Plain and simple poor management Environment has become one of CYA and recognition has been diminished to be happy you have a job Advancement is related to more of who you know than with what you know or how you perform,nan,Former Employee,Boise ID,Dec 2 2011

30,Good place but management has lost focus,,A good number of really great and driven people to work with Local IT guys are awesome,Micron doesnt seem to have any idea what they are doing in the SSD market It looks like they hired a bunch of management who have no experience in this market Too many cooks spoil the broth Very topdown environment Corporate IT seems to have an unlimited budget for new toys and they dont actually listen to engineering unless they are forced to Corporate IT treats engineering like children After Micron I more understand why so many people dont like IT folks or treat them with respect,Design Verification Engineer,Former Employee,Longmont CO,Nov 14 2015

20,Uninspiring,,Decent starting salary time off plan TOP is fairly generous most people seem down to earth and nice cafeteria has decent food and there are two Starbucks locations on site fitness center and clinic although a very disorganized and at times unprofessional clinic on site medical insurance premiums are reasonable Boise is a very nice city its nice to work at a headquarters that is also located on site at an RD facility since you can actually see what is going on in operations,Antiquated software that is unsupported and close to losing its functionality very low emphasis on making progressive changes in environmentalsustainability practices no cost of living raises only extremely high performers get performance bonuses and I think managers find petty reasons to score people lower to avoid paying bonuses very unclear promotion path that is subject to the whim of individual supervisors Micron does not pay for professional associations PE licenses from what Ive seen anyway or classes from third party sources that would be beneficial the interns Ive interacted with were family members of current employees not hired from a competitive pool of applicants very hesitant to hire managers from outside the organization that would benefit Micron by bringing in new views cube world with bullpens and a lot of noise no repercussions for yelling at or demeaning other employees frequent behavior by men that could easily be described as sexual harassment yet female managers receiving this treatment seem to do nothing about it criticism if you dare ask a lot of questions or question the way things have always been done way too many meetings too many people graduated from BSU University of Idaho or other Idaho colleges and they badly need people who have attended other colleges many team members dont seem very bright no company car available to conduct business off site so you pretty much have to use your own car or refuse to perform the task you generally cannot work from home unless youre willing to explain exactly what you plan to do at home many people have to keep complete time sheets of all tasks even if they are salaried you are expected to take an hour lunch even if you dont want to and worst of all site access is by key card and you can be sure despite what some might say that someone is tracking when you leave and arrive and how much time you spend on site which is not fair for salaried employees,nan,Current Employee,Boise ID,Jan 7 2015
30,Principle Software Engineer,,Product development teams in software are top notch and run like a top despite being a hardware company Motivated and motivating individuals with years of product development experience in flash technology and related software firmware,Lacking leadership and decision making abilities to engineer beyond yesterday Some organizations are stuck so far into the past on how to do things that a major shift in culture and management will be required to fix things,Principal Software Engineer,Current Employee,Sacramento CA,Feb 16 2016
40,A good place to work,,The pay is competitive with the industry Promotions are generally from within so advancement opportunities are relatively plentiful We work with new technology and methods so the work is rewarding in and of itself Benefits are about on par with everywhere else,The campus is a pretty long drive from most everywhere in the area The company doesnt support telecommuting all that much so I spend more than Id like getting to and from work There is often a disconnect between departments so that communicating goals and needs is a lot harder than it should be Also theres a little too much fingerpointing and blame deflection,Engineer,Current Employee,Boise ID,Jun 25 2008
20,Engineering innovation continues but management change is trying hard to ruin everything,,Engineering innovation knowledge people portfolio,New management who thinks Micron is SanDisk A cookie cutter approach and wants everyone to change what they have been doing Management keeps saying Micron is such a broad talent pool but in actions they dont respect Micron Everything needs to be changed to SanDisk style Also everyone from SanDisk is at least a Senior Manager Collusion at its best,Anonymous Employee,Current Employee,Boise ID,Feb 24 2019

10,Wouldnt recommend unless you have no other options,,The pay is about average for the industry which translates into good compensation if youre in a low cost area like Boise If youre in a highcost area the salaries arent as competitive There are some truly good people working hard in the trench,1 Micron is turning into Sandisk v 20 There have been few internal promotions to executive levels since Sanjay took over with most new blood coming from Sandisk and almost all are are nonAmerican and have no clue about the culture in places like Idaho Utah or Virginia that culture is what made Micron a success and theyre killing it 2 The executive team the CSuite execs in particular are COMPLETELY disconnected from the operations of the company seem unaware of the low morale theyve created with the focus on their own wallets and power structures and present a garbled disjointed values system that is more marketing than a realistic plan to improve the soul of the company For example they espouse the value we care about our people while at the same time kicking team members out the back door 3 The new performance management scheme is a thinly veiled attempt to layoff 1015 of American workers every year for the next 57 years While unspoken its become apparent that Sanjay and his team have no respect for American workers Each year 1015 of workers will receive a failing performance grade and while theres an alleged path to redemption in actuality its nearly impossible for those workers to meet the arbitrary and unrealistic expectations defined in their performance improvement plan And since everyone is graded on a bell curve every year another group of workers will fall into the failing category and be fired This rankandyank system has been shown over and over in studies dating back to the 1980s that it lowers morale turns the job into a popularity contest lowers efficiency and just doesnt work The fact that its in use in 2019 shows a level of incompetence and ignorance from the executive team and doesnt engender a lot of trust among the hard working team members who make them successful I personally know of dozens of highly skilled workers who are no longer with the company because of this scheme 4 Continuing from 3 its obvious that Micron is trying to get away with performing layoffs without having to report that material information to the SEC shareholders and other stakeholders Its a legal requirement in the US that all workforce reductions above a certain percentage must be reported 5 Expect to work 24 hours a day 7 days a week including on vacations holidays while sick etc With all the terminations and resignations and with no backfilling of those positions being allowed each team is doing the same job with less and less labor The inevitable result of this is going to be more failing performance evaluations and more firings Its a vicious cycle that will see workers spending more and more hours on the job never quite catching up to the workload being told theyre failures and morale will continue to decline 6 While youre expected to be oncall 247 and available by phone remote connection or pager the company doesnt provide equipment beyond a cheap 80s era pager with which to communicate and even thats only 1 way communication With 10 billion in profit last year the least the company could do is provide cheap smart phones for all team members who are expected to act 247 in the case of an emergency 7 The CEO is using the tax breaks provided in the new 2017 tax law to make 10B in stock buybacks Even as market conditions deteriorate the exec team is stubbornly sticking to the buyback plan This goes completely against the alleged progressive values the company purports to support 8 Expect to have your priorities shifted on a regular basis often while in the middle of a project that was top priority just 2 weeks ago The companys strategic planning is nonexistent and often happens after the action period has already started For example its March 2019 6 months into the fiscal year and upper management is still deciding how to execute on the nonexistent strategic plan for the year Also everything is a top priority which means nothing is really a priority and this contributes to low morale and indecisiveness by team members and their departments 9 Departments often have objectives that conflict with other departments and often those conflicts are resolved by whichever VP can yell the loudest or who knows the most powerful CSuite exec Ive been in meetings where I spent an hour listening to VPs and Directors scream and cuss at each other and Ive even seen several people threatening violence Those people are still with the company and leads to my next point 10 Many upper management and executive level leaders use a management style reminiscent of 1980s era thinking Management by fear Management by negativity Management by impossible expectations Management by dictate Management by enforced cutthroat competitions among team members 11 The company is slowly shifting American workers to India expect to train your replacement if your department is one of those being offshored 12 The environment for a regular cubicle worker is terrible The lighting is bad people are packed in like sardines the decor is drab theres very little natural light and overall it doesnt contribute to happy healthy and productive workers 13 The mental health of a lot of workers is extremely compromised Combine a poor physical work environment with cutthroat survival competitions shifting priorities opaque direction from the executive team the fear of dropping into the bottom 15 the hostility from management towards midmanagement and frontline team members and their are a lot of people in a really bad place mentally and emotionally The company has offered mental health services to team members but its attacking the symptoms without touching the underlying root problems,Senior Manager,Current Employee,Boise ID,Mar 6 2019

30,A Success Story for now from hardscrabble Idaho,,I write from the point of view of a senior design engineer Micron is an incredible success story in a very unlikely place mainly rural Idaho with just one small city Boise Certainly not a center of tech and maybe just barely a creative capital If you are from Idaho working for Micron is a dream job and if you want to escape to a place with low home prices wide open spaces mountainbiking and skiing galore relatively free of urban problems Micron might be your ticket to the kind of lifestyle you wont find in many places While Micron is very subject to the economic cycles of the semiconductor industry and has laid off tons of people they do want to do the right thing its not Silicon Valley after all but familyoriented Idaho People are here for the long term And if you are are a semiconductor manufacturing specialist or a memory expert youll find very challenging and rewarding work here,Hardscrabble Idaho culture basically a very conservative outlook with a strong aversion to risk and a fanatical dedication to cost cutting makes this a very hard place to innovate or even to feel that innovative or entrepreneurial ideas are welcome Micron as an extraordinary survivor in a tough business feels it has the formula for success down and has as much resistance to change built into every facet of its operation as any company Ive ever seen Actually you feel here that youve entered a time warp everything is early 80s from the sea of grey cubicles to the management practices to the strict 85 shift working hours and even the smoking break rooms There is some effort to pay for performance but the potential rewards are modest and in any case stingily doled out If you have worked in technology other than at Micron and Idaho is not your dream destination you are going to be deeply shocked by the culture here Still tech culture is not all rosy and the tradeoffs at Micron are not all bad The question though is what will happen to arthritic Micron if when they are faced with the next disruptive wave in their corner of the technology world,nan,Current Employee,Boise ID,Mar 18 2012
40,Team work oriented and family value emphasized,,Nice balance between work and family,Virtually no bonus due to keen competition in DRAM industry Profit from NAND and NOR is not sufficient to offset the loss in DRAM A long way to turn profitable,Senior Engineer,Current Employee,Boise ID,Sep 29 2012

30,Great place to start a career but leave quickly once things get stale,,The pros I list here are for Microns Virginia site The site had an excellent employee training program for new hires and employees with a few years of experience The yearly review was very structured and I would venture to say it was fair There is a career ladder which lists the requirements for promotions and so on Basically the site was very orderly and structured I feel that employee development was very good up to a certain point I think the benefits are good I was an above average employee and I got promotions every 2 3 years But if youre not getting promotions the salary increase will certainly stagnate The promotions also use to be very difficult but it seemed to have relaxed in the last few years,The cons I list here are for Microns Virginia site Some of these cons might apply to any semiconductor fab and not just to Microns Virginia fab This is a fab environment so everyone is expected to be on site by 8am There is a daily morning meeting to discuss what happened the day before For some people there is also a daily tactical meeting where a representative from every team in the fab meets to discuss the issue There always seems to be too many meetings This site is Microns only wholly owned fab in the US It is has become a legacy fab and I dont expect there to be any new technologies to be coming to this site The culture seems to be focused on how much time you spend at work and not about results I think the strongest argument for this point of view is that one of the metrics for promotions is startingending times at the site for a 3 6 month period If the person about to be promoted didnt spend enough hours at work their promotion would be delayed The last con I can think of is that this site is the only semiconductor site in the northern VA area This leads to a lack of competition for Micron Employees cant negotiate very well in this kind of environment and management doesnt see any need to offer any sort of perks for their employees,Product Engineer,Former Employee,Manassas VA,Oct 8 2014
30,Reasonable place to work,,Company is doing well recently Profit sharing is good 401K matching is good Career opportunities are available for those willing to grab them,The business sector that Micron is in is rather limiting If you are a new grad I would advise you to stay away Memory is a commodity product Its like apples oranges or jelly beans If you craves something more cutting edge and exciting go into a different high tech sector,Senior Level Design Engineer,Current Employee,Milpitas CA,Mar 5 2015

30,Not a top tier company,,Boise is a great location Some great people Diverse group of people Benefits are good with insurance and 401k matching 5,The worst thing is the silos When you rate a group of people and force a bell curve and cut the low performers you get everyone fighting each other for a better rating instead of promoting collaboration Not much changes either things get rolled out that are supposed to make things better but it feels as though they dont actually consult the people that work here and go off what is done at other companies Things go good for a bit then they just revert to doing things the way they always do Work life balance is also really bad it feels like we work harder with less Back filing positions dont happen very often so if you are short on your team expect to work more to pick up the slack If you do work harder expect promotion or talks of a raise only once a year on a cycle if the company is doing good enough otherwise you keep working hard without increase Recognition is also hard to come by unless management is reminded to give praise If you are looking for best in class company they are not it but for a mid tier tech company they are good Unless you are from a top tier school they mostly hire from within so getting in is difficult,Product Manager,Current Employee,Boise ID,Jun 12 2019

30,Can the company last in its current stagnant state,,Micron is a great place to work with wonderful people The treasure valley is a great place to live with many outdoor and recreational activities People at Micron generally want the company to be successful and strive for a standard of excellence There are many varieties of jobs you can obtain at micron from entry level temp work to senior level management The company offers perks across the Boise valley that enable you to receive discounts on restaurants theaters and shopping Management really promotes self development and education when related to semiconductors Micron also promotes from within so if you start low on the totem pole you do have opportunity to move up,Being started in the Boise valley means many employees are home grown and even more senior management is from the good ole boy network This creates a lot of friction when a outside individual is brought in to restructure and raise revenue but many managers ignore hisher presence out of stubbornness This really effects the entire organization things need to be done to streamline the company and they are making an effort but so many initiatives are being stopped because this brick wall of long timers Micron needs to restructure upper management as much as it does its operations By removing the road blocks a business plan can be effectively followed Micron never followed a business plan until late 2005 and it had been in existence for over 20 years,Business Analyst,Current Employee,Boise ID,Nov 25 2008
