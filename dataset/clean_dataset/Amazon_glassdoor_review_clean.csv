10,5,You Get What You Put In,Really smart people a lot of opportunity for growth always encouraged to be innovative think big and create something new Competitive salary and benefits with other major tech companies 100 self motivating work environment No dress code and 4 legged friends are welcome,You have to be self motivated NO ONE will hold your hand and tell you that youre doing a great job If you need constant affirmations from management this company isnt for you,Anonymous Employee,Current Employee,Seattle WA,Jan 10 2016
20,3,Exciting Work Abusive Culture,Jeff Bezos and his STeam are brilliant and continue to make great decisions for longterm growth You work with smart people you work on exciting projects you are pushed to your limitswhich can be rewarding when you accomplish great things The diversity of the potential work and innovation can be very alluring Ive often called Amazon my Sexy Mistressshes emotionally abusive but shes so sexy that I go back for more punishment,The management process is abusive and Im currently a manager Ive seen too much behind the wall and hate how our individual performers can be treated You are forced to ride people and stack rank employeesIve been forced to give good employees bad overall ratings because of politics and stack ranking,Senior Engineering Manager,Current Employee,Seattle WA,Feb 20 2016
30,4,Can be amazing for some people horrible for others,Amazon is doing lots of cool stuffbut lots of boring stuff too There are really well run teamsand very badly run teams The experience for software managers and engineers is all over the board from really run low operational load teams to teams where people burn out after a year Amazon is built quite deliberately to be Darwinian You can generally expect that anyone whos been here for more than 2 years is competent and motivated or they wouldnt have survived You can count on them as long as your priorities are aligned There arent many slackers here and they dont survive long We work on so much stuff that theres always an opportunity to find amazing cool stuff to work on note that its an opportunity one that you have to pursue A chance to make a huge difference A place where you can learn a lot about all kinds of things both technical and about yourself Amazon encourages high mobility even your manager cant prevent you from moving to another team within 6 weeks normally more than a few months under unusual conditions Your friends and family have actually heard of the place you work and have at least a vague notion of what Amazon does without you having to explain,Youre responsible for your own career progression and finding the places and teams that are doing the stuff you want to do No one is going to take you by the hand and help you with that Amazon is built quite deliberately to be Darwinian The strong survive and the weak perish metaphorically speaking and the bar is constantly increasing The level of performance that would have been acceptable five years ago will get you canned today Its a kind of crucible thatll help you develop a harder edge if you can survive that can serve you well in your career and in life but its often not a pleasant experience I wouldnt recommend it as a place to work for just anyone,Software Development Manager,Current Employee,Seattle WA,Dec 17 2013
40,5,An Amazing Place to Work,Ive been at Amazon for a month now and Ive seen none of the horror stories being communicated to the public although Amazon is a large enough company that Im sure there are good pockets and bad pockets Everyone here is really smart and wants to succeed both personally and as a company People collaborate and help each other focus on data and truly focus on the customer Every company Ive ever worked for talks about how important the customer is but on day 2 theyre forgotten Amazon seems to genuinely focus on whats best for the customer and its awesome to be in meetings where people actually bring that up and make decisions focused on longterm customer satisfaction The opportunities to learn here are literally unlimited and the opportunity to take on new responsibility is as well I honestly believe you can be as awesome as you want here,No cons so far seriously Like I said Im sure Amazon has some bad pockets in it here and there but this is an amazing job an amazing opportunity and the biggest thing I have to complain about is that its a little chilly in our building I can live with that Does Amazon demand high quality measurable results Yes Is it hard work Yes Is it rewarding Yes So Im not calling that a con Worklife balance seems comparable to other places Ive worked not worse,Software Development Manager,Current Employee,Phoenix AZ,Feb 23 2018
50,5,Amazing company and the most driven and smartest of the people,You can learn a lot very quickly in a very short time Surrounded with nothing but incredibly smart and driven individuals Compensation is well beyond my expectations and more than suitable Exciting projects all across the company that keep you interested and focused Amazon is changing the world,Can be overwhelming very steep learning curve Can be difficult to keep up if you are not self motivated,Software Development Manager,Current Employee,Phoenix AZ,Dec 3 2018
60,4,We are now in a world where we are condescended to by our inferiors,This company gets A list performance from C list employees The culture is quick and hard charging You are always working in relevant and meaningful projects,Maybe because the company recruits C listers who have neither merit intelligence strategic vision nor pedigree academic or professional accomplishments most of those who become successful do so in treacherous low cunning ways Imagine the Lannisters in Game of Thrones attacking the Starks in Game of Thrones or Rawls and Burrell attacking McNulty and Daniels in The Wire or Barrow and OBrien attacking Mr Bates in Downton Abbey This is every day leadership behavior at Amazon The culture at Amazon is so infested with these middling talent weasels who have juked the stats and schemed their way to positions of power that new employees coming in actually start thinking that this behavior is normal and expected if you want to manage people The work itself was stimulating and fulfilling but the sneering condescension of the d bags that cheated and skated their way through high school and party colleges then just converted their winky nod nod good ol boy shenanigans into a ask no questions have no introspection company culture have made manifest some of the worst criticisms of capitalism Any left leaning political aspirant would look at this business organism and immediately have content to lash out against the corruption that can come in free enterprise where hard work is not rewarded and the connected incestuous privileged class lounge their way to wealth while treating their employees and customers like some kind of filth their shoe picked up on the street,Anonymous Employee,Former Employee,Seattle WA,Mar 23 2017
70,5,Overall a Great Company with High Standards,Challenging sometimes fun work environment Being part of a team Doing great things Great people to work with,Organization and communication can be a challenge to maneuver around Hours can become a challenge when managing a hectic schedule Having to be available for any shift in order to move up in certain positions Work expectations and policies can change and can be confusing,FC Associate I,Current Employee,nan,Aug 30 2020
80,4,A huge diverse high tech company with all sorts of stuff,Disclaimer My opinions reflect that of an SDE in Amazon Seems like some operational job functions are very tough I have read through some of the other Amazon reviews and it seems to me that everyone has a very different experience This is so true Within the same team you can have both workaholics and slackers coexisting and coworking together I think I am more of the balanced type as I try to stay sane The Amazon experience is basically the entire spectrum and it is what you make it out to be Pros in Amazon certainly excludes great benefits but compensation is competitive Free food means average quality free coffee once in a while free pizza for lunch where it is a working lunch and free beer and finger food in special events We get a free Orca card to take any bus in the Seattle area for free 160 per month subsidy for office parking which is better than nothing Downtown monthly parking goes for about 200 per month 401K contribution is 50 of what you put in where you can put in max 4 of your salary Not so great Staff cafeteria food is average and not at all cheaper than outside food or could be even more expensive It is hard not to complain about the cafeteria Vacation days are ok but note that there are no sick leaves They count as part of your 5 personal days per year Listing the benefits of Amazon is like listing the cons and not the pros Work life balance seems to be ok for the most part and seems to be individuallydriven No one will tell you that you have to come in at what time and stay till what time I have team mates working every night and weekend and others getting in at 10am and leaving at 5pm all in the same team Managers will focus on your project deliveries instead of how much time you spend working If you work 40hour weeks productively you can definitely outperform someone who works 60hour weeks but dont deliver stuff Working less than 40 hours per week is somewhat common but I cant say how many people are working how long The view on work life balance is a bit skewed All it comes down to are the managers and what they think Projects are always neverending but I have found that deadlines are very realistic and reasonable without counting your nights and weekends Getting some slack time once in a while is probably a sign of a healthy work environment Everyone needs a break Oncall really really sucks Basically all it comes down to is having SDEs doubleduty as support operations engineers Note that oncall does not improve the code quality of any team in any way The oncall experience is particularly bad because you are using services from some other team and their code is of low quality and fails for the wrong reasons If the managers had given more time to up the quality there would not be so many problems Software is usually delivered with a tough deadline with code that meets the minimum quality bar and never gets improved for the next few years The code review process does not seem to help improve the code but it really obstructs developers from making great changes as unconventional things will not pass code review in clumsy minds Innovation and excellence are not the name of the game in Amazon Searching through the Amazon code base is usually not going to turn up quality code that you can actually reuse Integration is the name of the game in Amazon You will need to spend a lot of time to figure out how to integrate your code with another teams services Whether these other people are cooperative is a hitormiss I have found that most people are responsive and helpful but there are also quite a number of jerks who are out to make trouble for everybody It is not easy to work across teams but the experience is mostly positive Amazon is a huge behemoth and is hiring people like there is no tomorrow This reflects well on a good growth momentum but also is worrying that the company is not turning much profit If the company does not make money where is our bonus going to come from You can see new faces around the Amazon building almost everyday Downside is that we are taking in a lot of average to aboveaverage engineers and being an Amazonian SDE certainly does not share the same reputation as the top names Amazon is a huge mixed bag of some very talented people and some very dumb people I think the world is not turning up enough SDEs and the only way is for quality to go downhill As an SDE expect to spend most of your time talking writing emails and documents and maybe around 2030 of your time coding In most of the teams you can work on interesting projects but probably not revolutionary ones Note that Amazon is a very downtoearth company and the work is very downtoearth as well You will work on real things that people have actually requested for and that people will start using as soon as you are done Work is challenging but not to expect highly technically complex stuff Most of the work has to do with solving everyday problems To me this seems to make sense because I have ever tried working on experimental projects before elsewhere and I did not feel it was a good use of my time Internal mobility is a key strength of Amazon and I am not sure which company has done better than Amazon in this aspect Internal moves are easy You only need to stay in your team for a year before moving to a different team There is no easy way to tell which team is a good team to move to because they all have their different pros and cons and people and coming and leaving all the time Seattle is by much rumour an easier place to live than the Bay area Overall Amazon is a tough but yet sane place to work The flexibility of this company is really its core strength You have the freedom to excel as much as you want and also to slack as much as you want Bummer You shouldnt be slacking,Beware of bad managers and horrible team mates They are not specific to Amazon but they do exist in Amazon I have to admit that Monday is usually a blue day at Amazon and it is very tough to look forward to getting into office I dont know anyone in Amazon who looks forward to getting in on Mondays Be realistic about SDE requirements Coding skills are good to have but they are not the most important part of your job I think we are hearing the same thing from every company Medical coverage is average or below average Expect to pay about 60 per month for singles and about 240 per month for families 240 per month for families gives you 3000 in medical fees before you have to pay more anything outofpocket SDE advancement is unreal difficult They have about 6 levels total SDE 14 then Senior Principal Engineer and finally Distinguished Engineer The number of SDE 1s and 2s are huge Trying to get to SDE 3 seems to be allofasudden extremely difficult but not impossible So this essentially means that if you come to Amazon as a fresh grad SDE expect to get about only one or two promotions in your entire career which obviously is quite a lame expectation and reality You will probably do much better in your career advancement anywhere else Employee retention is horrible I am not sure why the philosophy seems to be trying to undercut existing employees and then hire from external sources Management all say that they are trying to retain people but actions dont seem to suggest anything better Rumour has it that annual pay raises are horrible This basically mean that either you are a superstar in the company before they will try to retain you or if you are smart you should not stay in Amazon for too long,Software Development Engineer,Current Employee,Seattle WA,Sep 19 2014
90,4,Warehouse associate full time for over two years,Great starting pay and the ability to get raises very quickly Full training in all areas are offered and if your willing to work hard and sweat everyday for 10 hours a day 4 days a week then this is the job for you The 4 day weeks go by quick it can be exhausting so proper rest and a healthy lifestyle will help you stay strong within this company Beat benefits as well once you are a hired on as a full time employee,After 3 years of working with the company you cap out at 1575 meaning you can no longer make any more money than that as a tier 1 associate Your expected to want to move up in the company and that is the only way to make a better hourly wage by advancing into management and operations management positions if there are any openings,Tier I Warehouse Associate,Former Employee,Carlisle PA,May 15 2017
100,4,Great place to learn churn n burn culture in finance,super smart people the best of the best from schools if you get hired here you will be hirable anywhere recruiting process is tough the pay is above average probably 15 times elsewhere but the expected results are 150 of elsewhere too lots of opportunities to work on new innovative projects cool SLU campus lots of options for food and drinks after work,frugality is taken to the extreme only 2 weeks vacation parking takes a year or more to get zero perks not even free Prime no fitness allowance poor 401k your peers will stab you in the back your manager will blame you for their errors you cant trust anyone people who throw others under the bus and take credit for other peoples work get promoted expectations 60 70 hours a week some teams expect Sunday to be an in the office day headcount never gets filled teams are always short a few people but the work keeps piling on,Finance Manager,Current Employee,Seattle WA,Mar 29 2017
110,4,Pay hours culture,Amazon has great pay and annual raises You also receive stocks as well As a salaried leader you are required to be at work before and after your team The hours are long and you have to be willing to work any shift day or night and be rotated every year or more frequently depending on what coverage is needed There are strict rules to protect yourself and the company It is very fast paced and extremely competitive Leaders are competing for the same roles and the internal promotion process is brutal and very public throughout the building You are pushed out of your comfort zone and pushed as a leader You will grow and learn how to be a great leader if you have the right mindset Amazon offers great benefits pay leave of absences FMLA paternitymaternity leaves and has a great 401k program As far as warehouse positions go Amazon is by far the best,Shift availability They expect you to commit to any shift any time It doesnt matter if you have kids are a single mom etc You are expected to work whatever shift they put you on They will not work work you if youre a salaried leader,Area Manager,Former Employee,Kansas City KS,Mar 28 2023
120,4,Warehouse associate,Tough Work but good pay,management improve Amazons overall rating Address employee concerns Actively listening to and addressing employee concerns is crucial for improving morale and reducing turnover Consider creating channels for employees to provide feedback and addressing their concerns promptly Invest in employee training and development Investing in employee training and development can help improve job satisfaction and retention rates Providing opportunities for employees to acquire new skills and advance their careers can also help attract and retain top talent Improve workplace safety While Amazon has implemented various safety protocols continuing to prioritize safety and implementing additional measures to prevent accidents and injuries can help improve employee morale and reduce turnover Foster a positive company culture Creating a positive company culture can improve employee morale and engagement leading to better performance and lower turnover rates This could involve encouraging teamwork recognizing and rewarding employee achievements and promoting a healthy worklife balance Offer competitive compensation and benefits Offering competitive compensation and benefits packages can help attract and retain top talent while also improving employee morale and job satisfaction Emphasize ethical business practices Ethical business practices such as treating employees and customers with respect can help build trust and loyalty with both employees and customers This can lead to improved overall company ratings and customer satisfaction Embrace innovation and sustainability Embracing innovation and sustainability can help improve the companys reputation and attract environmentallyconscious customers and employees Consider implementing sustainable practices and technologies such as renewable energy and waste reduction initiatives By addressing these areas Amazon senior management can improve the companys overall rating and position the company as an employer of choice in the highly competitive job market,Warehouse Associate,Former Employee,Saint Charles IL,Mar 16 2023
130,3,Amazon Warehouse Associate Review,The biggest positive of working at Amazon was the consistent scheduling Same days same times every week unless otherwise specified usually for highly predictable reasons holiday season especially Changes to the schedule were communicated ahead of time Fellow associates were generally pleasant Its a place to work and make money and the hiring process was relatively easy when I started in 2018 Good inexpensive benefits From Day 1 as well Time off is pretty easy to come by in terms of earning it and waiting for opportunities Most of the time off opportunities are not paid however and at least when I worked there you get a very minimal amount of PTO Not ideal but you are afforded some flexibility,The long hours were very much a pain Its easy to get burned out even only working four days a week Its ten hour days nearly eleven full hours at the facility in total working almost entirely on your feet doing physically demanding tasks in a loud fastpaced environment Its a grind It is no wonder the company has had such high turnover in their warehouses Im even shocked that I lasted as long as I did compounded by the fact that a sizable portion of my employment was during the peak of COVID19 and all that entailed and still does There is a set detachment between the office and the employees You are very much a number to them and nothing else This is a job where you get in to get out unless if youre trying to move up in management,Warehouse Associate,Former Employee,nan,Mar 29 2023
140,4,Pretty Good Workplace,You can use Personal Time anytime as long as you have enough hours Vacation and Unpaid Time are included Super easy to put in the time off Super easy job depending on what type of facility you are stationed at As long as you log your hours and finish your PMs youve got lots of freetime to work on the computer Theres a program to get a free Bachelors degree or Associates degree,If your management isnt that good your experience might not be as nice Operations tends to watch your every move when conveyance is down and will constantly ask when everything will be back online Joining during a start up might be difficult if you work with a group of people who are new to Amazon conveyance Theres lots of protocols and hoops you need to jump through to get some things done,Maintenance Technician,Current Employee,nan,Mar 20 2023
150,3,Good if youre interested in moving upcompetitive Rough if youre tired of the grind,Start out better than most entry level jobs around 18hr L1 Multiple time off options make for a good bit of flexibility Multiple shift codes to accommodate your scheduling needs A lot of opportunities to learn new processes equipment and skills A lot of opportunities to promote or move within company,Workload is rather strenuous even for the pay Very Grindy Indirects and PAs carry most of the workload Worklife balance very difficult to maintain Shifts quickly move beyond 10 hours to 11 or 12 hours For L3 Support roles are difficult to move into,Process Assistant,Current Employee,New Castle DE,Mar 29 2023
160,5,Good company,Realworld impact As an Applied Scientist youll be working on solving realworld problems and developing solutions that have practical applications which can be rewarding and fulfilling Interdisciplinary work Applied Scientists often work across different fields such as engineering computer science biology or chemistry allowing you to learn new skills and broaden your knowledge Varied tasks Applied Scientists may have diverse tasks ranging from designing and conducting experiments to analyzing data writing code or presenting research findings which can keep the work interesting and challenging Collaboration Applied Scientists often collaborate with other scientists engineers product managers or stakeholders in the industry which can foster teamwork and communication skills Career growth Applied Scientists are in high demand in many industries and the job outlook for this field is promising providing opportunities for career growth and advancement,Pressure to deliver results Applied Scientists are often tasked with delivering results under tight deadlines and high expectations which can be stressful and demanding Ambiguity Applied Scientists may encounter ambiguity in the problem definition or data interpretation requiring them to make assumptions and tradeoffs that can affect the results Technical skills required Applied Scientists need to have a strong foundation in technical skills such as statistics programming or experimental design which may require significant time and effort to acquire Limited creativity Applied Scientists may face constraints in the problemsolving process such as budget or time limitations which may limit their creativity and innovative ideas Competitive market Applied Scientists are in high demand but the competition for jobs in this field can be intense requiring a high level of qualifications and experience,Applied Scientist,Current Employee,New York NY,Mar 6 2023
170,4,Great Benefits OK Organization,Belonging to a gigantic parent company has its perks such as highvalue benefits health insurance pet insurance etc Accessible to each employee is also an Amazon discount code as well as countless learning resources and a gogetem culture Amazon Games definitely encapsulates the small company vibe well You are working with a manageably sized team and the hierarchy is relatively flat,The production pipeline is confusing Production for one character starts all at once and it is difficult to find assets on your own Be prepared to hurry up and wait and alter your animation at the last minute when you finally receive the final character model even after all your animation is wrapped,3D Animator,Current Employee,Irvine CA,Mar 30 2023
180,5,Great Place to Work with Amazing Colleagues,Ive been working as an Email Marketing Manager at Amazon and I must say that its been an amazing journey so far The company culture is highly collaborative and inclusive and I enjoy working with my colleagues who are highly skilled and passionate about what they do,One of the things that can be challenging about working at Amazon is the fastpaced environment Deadlines can be tight occasionally However I feel that this is also what makes the work exciting and rewarding,Email Marketing Manager,Current Employee,Seattle WA,Mar 28 2023
190,2,Lost a lot of weight so thats cool 🤷‍♂️,Lose weight Somewhat very nice and fairly diverse people to work with Two 30 minutes breaks Benefits are decent and start day 1 they’ll even pay up front for most college programs after you’ve worked 90 days minimum If you work in a state that pays more due to cost of living and transfer to a lower cost of living state you get to keep the pay and maybe even get more money for transfer offers Did I mention you’ll lose weight no bs I average no less than 11 miles walking per day Guess another pro is you’ll really come to hate Amazon lol,Rate rate and more rate Whatever department you’re assigned you’re hourly rate effects if you get written up That includes if you get labor shared to another department youve never worked in Getting promoted is basically impossible unless you apply for a higher tier position with any bachelors degree that could have nothing to do with leadership skills You’ll likely hate your job within a month You don’t get placed in a department based off experience or skills its all luck of the draw,FC Associate I,Current Employee,Garner NC,Mar 26 2023
200,1,What are you doing Andy,Good managers not great CEO I can work autonomously Health Benefits Commuter Benefits Work life balance Clear promotion paths Lots of free training programs to learn on own time You dont have to stick to one career you can transition out with the right skill set Great vacation time perks Working with great intelligent folks No dresscode,Mandatory 3 days in the office we didnt have this before remoteadvocacy People dont trust the current CEO with his decision making Poor decisions on Layoffs They have not been thoughtful regarding this It is definitely not the greatest employer There are many factors why people WFH Pay isnt as competitive compared to other tech giants Amazon falls behind on this Company can be pretty stingy You are pitted against a bell curve for performance and if you are at the bottom you may be asked to be in a development program and worsea pip,Executive Assistant,Current Employee,San Francisco CA,Mar 20 2023
210,2,Overloaded Scope of Work No Path to Growth,Great compensation really smart coworkers,When individuals move or leave that person’s entire job will be moved into yours or your teams scope without update to your comp or title Job descriptions are way to broad they approach scope as “there’s no such thing as this is not apart of my job” When promoted you’re paid in Monopoly money By that I mean you’re awarded stick shares that don’t vest for another twothree years There are huge issues in their org structures where one person will have 5 to 8 direct reports with varying titles tenure which presents the challenge of not knowing what title you’ll be promoted into how At my level L6 your boss is often the same level as you but with a more senior titles so path to grown is even murkier Lateral growth is hard as well because your boss can block your move There are also people in your chain of reporting who will have input into your performance review who you will never meet with or know I’m an L6 I’ve never met my L8 a person who has input into my careerfuture lol also diversity is not existent I was the only one on my team for two years,Senior Marketing Manager,Current Employee,Seattle WA,Mar 28 2023
220,1,Death by a thousand paper cuts,Amazon offers competitive salaries to employees,Amazon has a welldeserved reputation for terrible worklife balance and poor career prospects for software engineers While the prevailing understanding of 20222023 layoffs blames overhiring engineers during this time were still working incredibly demanding shifts often 5060 hours per week suggesting the problem of overburdened engineers is likely caused by something other than not having enough talent or labor While leaders enjoy and promote the culture of “ownership” that very culture coupled with expectations of high turnover and meager documentation means that actual development is usually hindered by years of inscrutable tech debt for any given product along with key gaps in institutional knowledge left by former employees Management exacerbates this problem by encouraging talent to flee the company through opaque performance review cycles with turnover quotas,Software Development Engineer SDE,Former Employee,nan,Mar 24 2023
230,3,DO NOT talk to the managers because once they like you you will be their slave,There are a handful amount of employees who are very respectful however they might stare at you and make you feel uncomfortable sometimes But those that do generally mind their business and only ask for help if they absolutely need it unlike the managers or process assistants who like to micromanage or outsource whenever they feel like they are too overwhelmed,If you are a good genuine person try to not talk to the managers because they will try to get to know you and use you as your slave especially if you do your job very good The other people who live in the area who are usually new will try to be social and get to know you only to talk about you behind their back do not talk too much These employees lives are miserable and it makes sense because everyone works the graveyard shifts 120 am1150 am 4 days a week there will not be any kind of fun in your life because when you are working the rest of the world is sleep and you are going to get the bottom half of the stick with everythingpay pto bonuses etc Amazon sucks I seen managers leave and never come back because the environment is so draining and the pay is never enough for the amount of work you do Silence is your best friend at this job Which sucks because who tf wants to go to work for 10 hours and sweat in silence,Sales Associate,Former Employee,Champaign IL,Mar 15 2023
240,4,The most challenged Ive been in my career,Ability to work on amazing projects flexibility immense trust from my manager cool colleagues amazing workspace opportunity for growth in skills and fun culture,Hard to understand upper level goals and how I make an impact personal biases with upper management which can cause people to lose faith in staying with the company If you arent with the right crowd you might not get any opportunities The pay rate when getting a promotion is extremely small It seems that the only way to get a pay bump is through boomerang And there are plenty of us that do not want to leave but its the only way to move up or get more money,LXD,Current Employee,Arlington VA,Mar 24 2023
250,3,Fun internship but lack of direction,My team was amazing extremely friendly diverse and professional It had a huge number of differing opinions yet everyone respected each other The job was challenging but provided me with a great opportunity to learn a variety of different things,I felt that the intern program especially for IT was very uncoordinated The interns program is created and managed by an offsite team that doesnt do a fantastic job explaining why the IT interns are there or what they should do When I arrived management was extremely confused about my level of expertise in IT and they werent sure what the internships end goal was Also the IT interns are placed in a class with other management interns which means a significant portion of their time is spent learning things that arent necessarily relevant to them how to pick pack etc Also depending on the size of your site and the quality of your team you might have a significantly different experience I knew some interns that were assigned to sites that only had one other engineer Also interdepartmental communication is a huge issue with all departments I interacted with at Amazon,IT Support Engineer Intern,Former Employee,nan,Mar 16 2023
260,2,Compensation is great work culture is terrible and…there is zero soul,This is an amazing opportunity at a top tier company Compensation is on parabove industry average You work with very driven and ambitious people learn new things every day,The expectation is to be self motivated and perform 110 everyday As an individual contributor it was a high stress work environment highly competitive borderline toxic and little work life balance Looking back at this experience after 2 years it feels like an abusive work culture compared 34 other companies I worked at I heard horror stories about people “selling their souls” to work here before I joined and it’s all true unfortunately There is a lack of diversity and inclusion certain departments outside of engineering They are trying to change but there is no true action and it can get exteremly exhausting It always felt like I had to work 2X as hard here And that is why I left,Account Executive,Former Employee,New York NY,Mar 28 2023
270,5,Rigorous culture growing pains,Everyone whos lived through the Amazon business culture walks away with an indelible work experience They really believe in embodying the set of Leadership Principles and the best colleagues are admirable in their care for the business customers and each other I had some great managers and was inspired by some great directors and VPs The standard Amazon way practices are also great training metrics annual OP planning sixpagers etc and and the cadence of weekly monthly and quarterly business reviews You can preview this in books like Working Backwards,Overgrown and many orgs became sclerotic In a Day One culture I saw groups that became the dreaded Day Two which was equated with decline and death Large company misincentivization of a growing manager class led to larger less nimble ultimately less efficient and creative teams It just varies a lot now by org You can still find pockets of admirable excellence,Principal Product Manager,Former Employee,Seattle WA,Mar 26 2023
280,1,Just a number,Overpaid flexible voluntary time off and unpaid time up to 80 hrs and its HARD to get fired Theft of time or product is the easy way,You are just another person to them regardless of how hard you work time you put in voluntary extra time you take to help them how green your calendar is how much training youve done permissions on scanner how safe you keep it etc If someone has been there a day longer and is one of the just show up people they will keep them over you Amazon has a anyone amd everyone policy which is great but where is the keep anyone and everyone Obvious racism and prejudice in the building They deny it though And obvious favoritism Ifa manager thinks you are cute you will have it easy and vice versa Its not a good place for job security Start up job at most Lazy stays lazy amd is allowed to stay lazy Pay is the same for everyone no matter what your skill if on the same tier No wondet turn around is so high This is what ive observed in under a year,FC Associate Tier I,Current Employee,nan,Mar 14 2023
290,5,Everyone is very nice Amazon Web Service Team is best out of all Good work culture One of the highly paying job,vibrant fast paced culture smart fun aggressive colleagues management is focused on latest tech trends and staying or becoming a leader for many of them by and large customers and partners are very positive about the technology good benefits and perqs,Worse still is the politics When you hire a bunch of smart aggressive people and put them in an environment of outsized expectations throw in a bunch of reorgs and changing management and sprinkle with uncertainty and constantly changing priorities you inevitably get people back stabbing each other and throwing others under the bus to appear smarter and more worthy of promotion,nan,Current Employee,nan,Apr 6 2015

790,4,Good for self development,You can learn how to lead a team and be good with handling completely chaotic situations The people you work with will become family Even if short lived,Amazon has gone back to their old standards of hiring and promoting but worse You cant be hired as a supervisor of the street except in very rare circumstances Never once at my building keeping it internal and hoping employees work less than 12 years max Thier strategy was to have always fresh new ideas Instead of internal though you can only promote out of your building with this new program It causes problems either way because the associates dont have consistent leaders One day you walk in and have a new manager who has to fumble through the job without proper training,Shift Supervisor,Current Employee,nan,Feb 11 2023

920,2,Not the best,Your shift varies and you can use Paid time off or unpaid time off when you please in case you can’t come in for any reason Overtime is only really offered during the holidays You can get hired easily with no hassle or even really an interview,All break rooms and bathrooms can be far depending on where your stationed You are micromanaged about rates If you’re seasonal don’t expect to transition into a fulltime employee or regular for like 4 months if you ask HR about it they won’t really give you information this isnt good especiallt if you have a family and need benefits You can’t make a change to your schedule unless your a regular associate HR is not really helpful depends on person Management is not the best Voluntary time off is only available to whoever they want to give it to They don’t offer it to everyone Some floors never get VTO,Fulfillment Center Associate,Former Employee,San Marcos TX,Mar 10 2023
930,3,Amazing team culture instability promoted by top leadership,My team is the best and the projects are interesting Ive never worked with more brilliant creative and fun people We get to work hard have fun and do hard things,Particularly in 2023 top leadership at Amazon is making decisions that contribute to a feeling of whiplash for employees With consistent sudden announcements of layoffs no team visits return to office and desk hoteling with seemingly little consideration for the people theyre impacting theyve really soured a special culture,Software Engineer,Current Employee,Los Angeles CA,Mar 23 2023
940,3,Good For External Hires Bad For Promo,Good health insurance good culture,If you promote they will exploit you by paying you as little as possible while pretending like they’re doing you a favor If you promo from hourly nontech to to salaried tech you will be forced to take a salary nontech role for 312 months while you wait for them to give you proper title You’ll make the same pay as you did while L3 even though you’re operating as L4L5 engineer which pays on average 23x more If you’re like me you’ll also have a series of managers lie to you andor string you along while they focus on their own promotion and using you to make themselves look good Some of them promo and immediately rotate into other parts of the company never to be seen again while you’re stuck living paycheck to paycheck… even though your teammates who you helped train make 23x more than you,Business Analyst,Current Employee,nan,Mar 7 2023

1000,3,A decent job for those looking for a fastpaced environment and competitive pay,Working for Amazon is an okay experience The company offers competitive pay and benefits but the workload can be very demanding and stressful at times The company offers opportunities for career advancement but the promotion process can be unclear and competitive The worklife balance can also be challenging with long hours and little flexibility in scheduling,The company culture is focused on efficiency and meeting targets which can create a highpressure environmentThe training process is extensive but some employees have reported that it can be overwhelming and lacking in proper support Management can also be hit or miss with some supervisors being supportive and others being handsoff or micromanaging,Product Manager,Former Employee,nan,Mar 20 2023
1010,3,5050,Great medical benefits with Bluecross Promotion opportunities New hire bonuses If applicable when applying Met a lot of great people and a few very good friends there The culture can sometimes be lively but can feel completely depressing It really depends what building you’re in what department you’re stationed at and what kind of atmosphere your manager brings to the team,“Timeofftask” TOT basically getting micromanaged or potential writeups if you’re not scanning something every 5 minutes Overtime is mandatory and there have been WEEKS during peak or holiday season where you work on average between 5560 hour work weeks There are promotional opportunities but it takes a LOT of work just to get from a tier 1 to a tier 3 HR “prides” themselves in caring for associates mental health but honestly they couldn’t care less about your problems They’re just there to make a check And don’t expect HR to have any answers for your questions 75 of the time even though that pertains to their job,Warehouse PickerPacker,Former Employee,nan,Jan 19 2023

1030,3,Amazon HR,Experience in the field for new HR professionals 4 day work week and shift options including nights this could be seen as a pro or a con as someone who was on the front half shift and enjoys nights it worked well for my schedule However they make you rotate every 6mos and I did end up on days at one point,Over worked and undervalued Company was trying to grow so fast it could not sustain the growth and staffing suffered causing burnout Nontypical HR work week HRAs are required to be on site basically all operating hours 600am300am shifts are either Sun Wed AMPM 10hrs or Wed Sat AMPM 10hrs Rotating shifts every 6 mos depending on the situation and management you can try to get the shift you want but doesnt always happen HRAs were consider low level for HR and did not qualify for the hourly benefits of typical associates as L4s but were not salary so did not qualify for the benefits of salary L4s,Senior HRA,Former Employee,Salt Lake City UT,Feb 27 2023
1040,2,Wouldnt return to or recommend Amazon,Teammates consistently demonstrate willingness to help each other Great commercial business models Wide array of readily available training resources,Surprisingly poor leadership beginning at initial supervisory levels Poor internal decisionmaking processes related to information security Mature value framework but suffers from poor execution and lack of leadership accountability Because of size Amazon is able to readily hide or ignore broken processes rather than address them,Program Manager,Former Employee,Arlington VA,Mar 28 2023
1050,1,Previously happy employee now extremely disheartened,Working with such intelligent people has been amazing the ability to collaborate across states and countries while making a meaningful and measurable impact for the company and our customers has been an awesome experience,With Andys initial messaging around not having intentions to change the WFH structure and leaving that up to the discretion of the managers themselves this RTO announcement seems to have very little consideration for the people that were hired during the pandemic I was hired during this time with confirmation from my manager that living 3 hours from the office was not going to be an issue as I could have full WFH status and travel in when my team was in town The lack of consideration and data driven thought on this announcement has lost so much trust from the employees at the company and goes against so many leadership principles that the company states they build all decisions from,Supply Chain Manager II,Current Employee,Seattle WA,Mar 17 2023
1060,5,A lot to learn but gets easier with time Overall great company to work for,Great company to work for with helpful knowledgeable and caring supervisors Great benefits that start on day one was a huge bonus Also weekly pay above average hourly wage,Information overload With this job there is a vast array of fields you need to be trained in to really be able to be effective helping Sellers Some calls and emails we receive are very difficult sometimes including multiple issues which take a lot of time to investigate and resolve You are given in my opinion somewhat unrealistic allowable handling times expected to annotate everything and send a recap email as well in a short time period With experience it gets easier but at least in the beginning it is a bit overwhelming,Seller Support Associate,Current Employee,nan,Mar 6 2023

1110,4,Good pay okay benefits great place to learn,Decent flexibility control over what you work on so lots of learning opportunities and IMO a great postgrad gig Everyone at Amazon uses AWS so the experience you build here is directly applicable to 90 of startups and other companies plus no internal languages so pretty much everything you work on is directly transferrable to outside the company Compensation is competitive benefits decent,Can be somewhat intense deadlines are short and everyone does oncall which can be stressful unforgiving Food is not provided in the office make of that what you will,Software Development Engineer SDE,Current Employee,New York NY,Mar 12 2023
1120,1,Toxic Site Cancerous Culture,The medicaldentalvision benefits are adequate and the company does offer unpaid time paid time off and vacation from day one They also offer the Career Choice program for associates to upskill and pursue other worthwhile opportunities,The company indoctrinates you at every opportunity with their core values and then hides behind them without ever actually displaying any of them There is zero real empathy for associates and nothing but constant placation They tell they general public they favor Veterans and promote from within but the truth is the majority of all leadership are external hires with shiny new degrees and virtually little to no actual realworld or life experience Insult to injury YOU will be the ones responsible for training your leaders in their new roles while THEY reap a pay structure and compensation youll never collect on Even if you grow organically from within and are promoted to their rank you will NEVER bring home what they do with their overly generous compensation packages If you display any modicum of competence they will trap you in your role and constantly overleverage you knowing they can delegate everything they are either too lazy or inexperienced to complete themselves The majority of them lack any time management or accountability whatsoever and promotions are largely based on politics and favoritism NOT your workethic and accolades Any attempt to disagree and commit a company leadership principle will be met with hostility and their every effort to supplant you ensuring you never prosper within their organization Be wary of all the empty promises they shower upon you as more often than not it is a ploy that will never see fruition despite your myriad efforts to go above and beyond their unrealistic expectations,Tier III Process Assistant,Current Employee,nan,Jan 29 2023

1140,2,Underwhelming,Opportunities to learn Programs are well thought out,With cheap money evaporating fast from the market it appears senior leaders are in panic mode and lost Many employees spend time thinking on how they can be promoted many would come up with new sounding and shiny projects that have been done by others without real innovation throwing in words like mechanism working backward scalable rolling them out by inviting others to listen to them live and cherry pick on what to report making them sound successful Box checked now wheres my promotion The company is in Day2,Senior Client Lead,Current Employee,nan,Mar 23 2023

1720,5,Safety First,Lots of opportunities to make more money by overtime incentives and lots of lateral promotions and upward promotions to higher level you start at L1 but easy to move up if you show initiative drive and excerise safety first and foremost,Because of the safety first mentality they are always encourage associates to report every little thing a minor infraction cause you a right up probation of 90 days a freeze on any lateral and upward promotions also freezes any opportunities for transfers to other building facilities Im all for safety conscious environment however they loose a LOT of awesome employees due to this rule also if cannot have any other right up for a yr otherwise it will cause an emmediate termination you can always appeal but chances are you wont win it rules are rules you can come back in a yr Im concidered a high performer my rates are always way above average When I see an associate doing something that I know they can get a right up I dont go running to management as they implore people yo do everyday Instead I stop the associates and with encouraging words tell them that what they are doing will cause a right up if caught or seen by safety or another associate And encouraging way again tell them the correct way my associates love me for that they are here to work and make money not to break the amazon law encourage them dont disapline them like kindergarten kids,Material HandlerPIT Driver,Current Employee,Lewisberry PA,Nov 30 2022

2630,1,A living nightmare,Nothing will ever be as awful once you leave,Where to begin I could write a book I’ll give this example to sum up Amazonian culture During breast cancer biopsies and cervical cancer scares I was put on “focus” Basically a performance improvement plan With all of the stress and doctor appointments I was going through Negative review after negative review…in the years of working my salary has gone down by about 40K Leadership does not care about employees,Program Manager,Current Employee,Seattle WA,Mar 23 2023
2640,3,The excitement fades,First two years of pay are great I work with many competent people Some managers will allow you to work autonomously The work is so engaging if youre a problem solver As an employee you cant be a person that just likes the status quo You have to be a driver of change Your role isnt written down word for word,RSUs after two years of employment in a declining economy severely impacts pay Managers change every six months Out of the three Ive had my hiring manager was great the second was incompetent and my current is extremely controlling and stubborn Peer competition is real and doesnt make for an ideal working environment It breeds mistrust Being Amazonian is a term thats used as a weapon If someone doesnt like something or someone they say the idea or person is unAmazonian Ive heard this numerous times verbally and in email by leaders As a manager we are forced to stack rank in my group Someone always has to be at the bottom and is forced to be put on an improvement plan with the intent to get them to leave or be fired It is NOT to help them improve This causes managers to artificially inflate their people so they wont have to be the one to go through the cumbersome Focus or Pivot processes,Senior Program Manager,Current Employee,nan,Nov 12 2022
2650,4,Its a grind,You get to work with smart people usually and have a lot of autonomy to make decisions and suggest new ideas There is tons of room for lateral movement in the company pending you are a strong performer,They want to get 15 to 2 years of work out of you every year that is they expect you to always be doing more There is never an end to the todo list and everyone around you subscribes to the same contagious keep on doing mindset,Account Executive,Former Employee,New York NY,Mar 15 2023
2660,1,Worst move of my career,There are great Associates at this building,Management is too worried about knocking someone down a peg or two to notice the talent that they have in front of themselves Also stop looking for the quote un quote problem and look for ways to helpcorrectmold your subordinates to be without them noticing I worked RT shift we couldn’t get people written up for anything for over 6 months because HR was backed up… ha What a joke To get a senior to even talk to an RT Process Assistant was like pulling teeth,Tier III Process Assistant,Former Employee,Appling GA,Mar 15 2023
2670,3,Better than expected but still not great,People were much more helpful and supportive than I expected I experienced very little of the toxic culture that I had heard so much about Everyone I worked with was also super intelligent and really knew what they were doing,I was hired straight out of MBA and then laid off after only four months In my time there it was an absolute whirlwind Things move really fast and its a massive machine My onboarding was not great and I had a hard time keeping up,Senior Product Manager,Former Employee,New York NY,Mar 14 2023
2680,1,Leadership doesnt listen,I get to work on a team of exceptional writers who genuinely care about the work that we do This is a very personal experience your experience at Amazon changes wildly depending on the team you work on and mine happens to be very strong,Upper leadership makes decisions without accounting for the personal impact or providing sufficient data to back up their decisions Most recently they have decided to implement a 3day per week mandatory return to office RTO which they have applied globally to all corporate employees Many of us were hired with the expectation and understanding that we would be entirely remote so many of us do not live within commuting distance to the offices we work in The previous model which has been extremely successful over the past three years has allowed each team to make their remote vs office arrangements This new mandate does not allow for that anymore and they are simply expecting people to relocate to areas with significantly higher costs of living and densely populated areas There are insufficient desks for the number of people they expect to bring in desks are not assigned or guaranteed and there is little consideration given for the increased time and cost required for commuting into the office three days a week The issue is less about requiring office attendance and more about the lack of concrete data to support this decision rather than anecdotes about culture or riffing and the lack of transparency Many of us feel lied to about what to expect of our experience at Amazon and built our lives around very different understandings and expectations,Technical Writer,Current Employee,Seattle WA,Mar 21 2023

2700,3,Amazon on a downward spiral,Stocks Health Care Innovation Big Company Good People,Zero Work Life Balanceeven though they promote it after pandemic very little growth opportunities in management Very harsh work environment where there is no loyalty Seniors leaders were promoted quickly to handle the burst of incoming business from the pandemic but did not have the true skill sets needed to lead effectively so there exists lots of panic in the leadership ranks Promotions are not decided by merit or results but by race and gender Leaders are ranked and no matter how well you perform if you are ranked lastusually determined by race gender it is their duty to get rid of you I personally saw this happen many times Amazon struggles to recruit L4L5L6 talent and the people they do are usually miss led to what the role really is and transfer out leaving very inconsistent leadership at sites,General Manager,Former Employee,nan,Feb 1 2023

2740,5,Great place to work,Love the team I work with Everyone is super nice and very available to help with any questions I might have They really make sure to set you up for success by giving you several weeks to work your way through the training materials and start you off slowly with positions One of the reasons I left my previous employer was there were zero growth opportunities At Amazon it feels limitless There are so many teams and chances to grow that it is really exciting to think about where your career can go I dont feel pigeon holed and Im really excited to see where I can go here,Although I wrote about the training materials in the Pros section it can also be seen as a Con just by the sheer amount of information there is There is so much that it becomes a project all by itself to make sure you are staying organized and can find the information later I wish I would have started a digital notebook earlier on to help organize everything There has also been so much change that it has been a little difficult to really get into a rhythm My manager left to another team two weeks in we merged with another organization 1 month in and I switched the tech teams I was supporting twice It is part of the culture to accept change but when you are learning it makes it a bit tough,Technical Recruiter,Current Employee,nan,Oct 7 2022

2800,1,Wanna be stressed overworked and unvalued,NAME,Leadership is untrustworthy and hypocritical The RTO mandate goes against Amazons LPs and ironically is destroying its culture rather than promoting it Leaders have had 0 transparency and have continuously dodged questions Promotion process is convoluted and tedious After your first 2 years your compensation is highly dependent on company stock,nan,Current Employee,Arlington VA,Mar 23 2023

2850,4,Good Start,As an ontologist there arent many places you can be hired where you have a lot of other people in the same job family The ontologist community here is more relaxed and welcoming than I expected at Amazon I had anticipated Amazon would be more churn and burn It may be in other areas for all I know and I expect it is But there are also plenty of subcultures that are manageable and fun The Product Knowledge ontology team is one of those Good onramping time and materials The company doesnt ask too much of me too soon and the training is high in production value and usually relevant to what I do Once youre in the company is large with a lot of different things you could do So if you dont find the perfect fit when you first join transferring is very possible and common Getting in the door is the hardest part Pay and benefits were competitive in my experience I dont think that is a universal experience though,The systems at Amazon are very unique to Amazon Its unlikely that youll come here and be able to hit the ground running on building the taxonomy OWL skills for instance arent very applicable at this point The interview process was long and involved Theres a lot of corporate culture cultlike stuff If you want to fit in or get promoted youre heavily encouraged to learn the lingo core leadership principles team tenets specialized vocabulary Thats not bad in and of itself but it definitely isnt for everyone,Ontologist,Current Employee,nan,Dec 1 2022

2910,4,Pretty Good,Pay is good for the work My team members for the most part are really cool to work with and weve really bonded over the adventures weve had together My team is smaller so my managers are really good about being quick and efficient with their tasks followups and requests,AAs sometimes use you as a means to vent or yell at because they are frustrated about their situation You have to bite your tongue a lot of the time but that doesnt happen every day It can be very frustrating when HR pushes AAs towards you for things out of your scope such as HRrelated subjects that theyre too lazy to deal with Personally at my facility theres an HR rep who doesnt have the right personality for their jobits almost like theyre always greatly annoyed with having to interact with AAs everyday which is what they get paid to do Theres a lot of paperwork that you have to do every day and sometimes it can be overwhelming when your lobby is full and youre balancing multiple things on your plate It can be hard to balance life and work because our team is small and there are only 5 shifts you could have Front half days or nights back half days or nights or a swing shift,OMR Onsite Medical Representative,Current Employee,nan,Dec 13 2022
2920,1,The definition of TOXIC ENVIRONMENT Stay away for your sanitys sake,None I can think of,By far the worst experience in my career and Ive been around I was very nervous about joining Amazon because of its reputation of being a Toxic environment unfortunately in my experience it is worse than I expected high stress unreasonable demands on employees out of touch management they claim worklifebalance just empty words they will pile on so much work on you where its impossible to do nothing but work I wanted to quit after my 2nd month there No one cares about you from the day 1 its sink or swim no one will train you you have to figure things out on your own and if you make a mistake its all over for you Super high turnover in 6months I was on my 2nd manager 3rd director most of my teammates are new less than a year and already miserable All of the rumors you readhear are true in my experience Maybe I just had bad luck and landed on the wrong team but I doubt it Amazon pays you a sign on bonus in a lump sum in year 1 as an incentive not to quit within your first 12 months as an attempt to lower turnover rate If you resign youll have to pay it back prorated so if you join demand that your sign on bonus is paid monthly In short stay away,Senior Financial Analyst,Current Employee,Seattle WA,Feb 1 2023

4790,5,Great place to work,Love the team I work with Everyone is super nice and very available to help with any questions I might have They really make sure to set you up for success by giving you several weeks to work your way through the training materials and start you off slowly with positions One of the reasons I left my previous employer was there were zero growth opportunities At Amazon it feels limitless There are so many teams and chances to grow that it is really exciting to think about where your career can go I dont feel pigeon holed and Im really excited to see where I can go here,Although I wrote about the training materials in the Pros section it can also be seen as a Con just by the sheer amount of information there is There is so much that it becomes a project all by itself to make sure you are staying organized and can find the information later I wish I would have started a digital notebook earlier on to help organize everything There has also been so much change that it has been a little difficult to really get into a rhythm My manager left to another team two weeks in we merged with another organization 1 month in and I switched the tech teams I was supporting twice It is part of the culture to accept change but when you are learning it makes it a bit tough,Technical Recruiter,Current Employee,nan,Oct 7 2022

4850,2,Bashing my head against the wall,Easy to get in for first job if you meet the requirements bachelors in anything and can move to an available position Autonomy over time off even though its not enough time off,Overworked terrible schedule of which you have no say in pay is far too low for the amount and type of work expected Pay is also not location based which does not make any sense considering it is a fullyonsite role There is ZERO ability for negotiation or discussions about pay raises at least from L1 L4 Many issues with the promotion system If you even want to get to L5 in HR you must invent some problem and act the hell out of a pretend solution I am not supposed to be an actor I am supposed to be doing HR work They dont accept great work and the obvious ability to perform at the next level Not to mention the difference between HRP and HRBP L5 is just that they attend reginal meetings presenting the data that you gave them You also will not be promoted unless you manager is willing to vouch for you so you will have to kissup to them and basically beg for a promodoc They will make up reasons to say you are not ready even if they have said over and over that they have no feedback for you and you are a superstar and the best on the team Many people spend over a year in stretch roles where they are not given any extra pay or given a title increase but are doing the work of the next level And they are still not guaranteed that promotion when time comes Seen more than one get passed up for an outside hire Absolute nonsense If your in Sr leadership and your building metrics are not the best more than a few times they will fire you Doesnt matter the reason why the metrics are not met This on top of already terrible turnover rates mean I have had 34 HRBPs in 2 years and about 5 site leaders This is not to mention the desk work makes you wan to jump off a cliff Anyone can be hired as an associate and they will drive you crazy The turnover rate is insane for T1s and they act like its HRs fault for not having enough pizza parties and bingo days This means there are always new people who have questions everyday Associates will fight each other and do other nonsense that makes your job so much harder The bigger the building the worse the problems but at least they have more HR Small buildings are at gearing ratio but there is too much work and the small HR teams cannot keep up Ultimately not worth the amount of hoops they make you jump through I hear that the higher levels 56 outside of the warehouse are much more reasonable So if you want to work for Amazon come here to get your foot in the door with HR if you can handle the schedule and low pay in high COL areas ie no kids then get a better position and boomerang back to in a few years This will get you much more pay and a better position in way less time then the nonsense promotion system here,HR Partner,Current Employee,nan,Mar 4 2023

4990,5,Excellent for career growth,My perspective coming from a wellestablished European engineering company is that Amazon is at a completely different pace There is no room for complacency and the rate of growth is astonishing The leadership principles are not just a corporate statement they really are the norm here And they make you feel very empowered once you internalize them If you are looking for professional growth and endless opportunities this company is miles ahead than others Ive known Most importantly you are compensated for what you do in a very datadriven way there is no convoluted paths for promotion and the culture is almost of an almost utopian meritocracy,Not a con per se but I have known many people who are just looking for a 917 job same same every day a comfortable safe position in a giant company This is not what Amazon is about We want you to grow from day one The company has a place for people of all walks of life but you have to be ambitious driven and willing to put the effort Sometimes it is hard to be motivated by a greater purpose of the company I would say that the best outcomes of Amazon to the world are byproducts of its core services setting a legitimate customeroriented standard for corporations promoting an engaging and inclusive work environment enabling people to do more dignified jobs by automating trivial work optimizing logistics and distribution of goods with technology etc In my position there is a lot of business travels so make sure to align the expectations with your family and yourself,Controls Integration Engineer,Current Employee,nan,Oct 10 2022

5060,5,Great Job if you appreciate high expectations,They have very high expectations They expect employees to be high IQ selfstarters who will learn onthejob This means that all the people around you are high IQ self starters who will learn onthejob If you appreciate that kind of environment this place is for you Everyone understands that disagreement is how you arrive at a solution not a criticism of a person Hierarchy is seen as a mechanism for decisionmaking not a sign of status Even within the first few months of working here the services you contribute to and write code for will be hit with more traffic than you could possibly imagine in other words if you like the idea of creatingatscale this job is for you,If you like your job to just be a job you wont like working at Amazon You need to take pride in what you do and enjoy going aboveandbeyond,Software Development Engineer SDE,Current Employee,nan,Jan 15 2023
5070,5,One of the best places to work for tech,I have only been here for a little over 3 months and so far it has been a really good experience The on the job training is one of the best Ive seen AWS really gives you the time you need to learn about the company and how to be successful at your job There are a lot of valuable skills you can develop due to the wide array of services AWS offers The promotional track is also among the best Ive seen Promotions are objective and based almost solely on your work performance You can grow within AWS or you market the skills in the open market,AWS is its own universe of services and technologies apart from any other organization you may have experience with in the past Upon hire you may not be placed where your skills and experience align best You are placed where there is company need This is understandable from a company perspective but as the employee it poses a tremendous learning curve Also during onboarding important information about pay benefits etc is furnished to you very slowly and incrementally Lastly being paid monthly is definitely not preferable,Cloud Support Associate,Current Employee,Herndon VA,Nov 28 2022

5190,4,Pretty Good,Pay is good for the work My team members for the most part are really cool to work with and weve really bonded over the adventures weve had together My team is smaller so my managers are really good about being quick and efficient with their tasks followups and requests,AAs sometimes use you as a means to vent or yell at because they are frustrated about their situation You have to bite your tongue a lot of the time but that doesnt happen every day It can be very frustrating when HR pushes AAs towards you for things out of your scope such as HRrelated subjects that theyre too lazy to deal with Personally at my facility theres an HR rep who doesnt have the right personality for their jobits almost like theyre always greatly annoyed with having to interact with AAs everyday which is what they get paid to do Theres a lot of paperwork that you have to do every day and sometimes it can be overwhelming when your lobby is full and youre balancing multiple things on your plate It can be hard to balance life and work because our team is small and there are only 5 shifts you could have Front half days or nights back half days or nights or a swing shift,OMR Onsite Medical Representative,Current Employee,nan,Dec 13 2022

5250,5,IT at Amazon,IT at Amazon are inclusive they have a great work culture and coworkers are great Many things are automated which cuts time in performing many tasks The opportunity to network with other people and coworkers is great Amazon is really big on professional growth and opportunities to obtain more skills Great Corporate work culture Compensation and other benefits such as PTO vacation and retirement are competitive,Since many things are automated for ease you may forget how to perform some tasks which my advice would be to practice on Microsoft Server Azure or CISCO packet tracer if you feel certain skills are important to remember how to accomplish out of Amazon,IT Support Associate II,Current Employee,nan,Feb 10 2023
5260,1,Don’t fall for it,The people you get to meet,The people you have to work with pay hours no family time They promote on good ole boy system If you missed your chance for promotion that quarter bc your boss forgot then you’re not getting promoted I’ve seen people come in with less experience and made it to the top in 3 years while others who didn’t play the “game” are still area managers and no increase in pay 95 of the managers i worked with have left,Area Manager II,Former Employee,Memphis TN,Mar 24 2023
5270,1,Worst employment experience in my life,The pay was the only good thing,Horrific management They can easily set you up to be let go by making up an unfounded and unsupported claim of something you didn’t do then put you on a plan so you can’t ever be promoted or apply for other jobs internally to protect their favorites Then tell everyone about your status and have other people spy on you My lead flirted shamelessly with the more attractive and younger team members it was embarrassing to listen to and then he’d bloviate endlessly about how great he was Stressful as hll I was relieved to be let go because I felt suicidal after working there Literally had to go on meds and am still suffering from PTSD,Recruiting Manager,Former Employee,nan,Feb 26 2023

5390,2,Complicated to say the least,When you work as an Amazon delivery driver really you are working for a DSP a delivery service partner that isnt directly involved with Amazon Though regardless of what you do the DSPs usually have more than enough work if you are willing to do it The pay is alright for what you are doing and you only need to have a drivers license and only a light criminal record to get the job,Driving for an Amazon DSP in my experience will always involve a level of uncertainty going into the day You will not know how many packages you have to deliver in a day until you pull up into the warehouse to pick them up This usually means you have no idea the number of hours you will pull in a day You could be done in 5 or you are working 1012 hours You are basically on your own all day and if you are delivering in the city the headache of trying to get into buildings as well as walking several flights of stairs due to nonexistent or broken elevators is commonplace Regardless of if you are in the city or a suburb you are supposed to keep a set pace when delivering that is tracked by the app DSPs are notoriously very all over the place when it comes to standards of work so really expect the worst when it comes to anything,Delivery Driver,Former Employee,Bronx NY,Dec 27 2022

6630,2,Fast pace get paid to workout but can be a toxic environment,Fast pace environment 4 to 5 hour shift goes by quick because you are so busy Very diversified get to work with people from all cultures and ages They have vending machines with gear like gloves and orange safety vests in case you lose yours because I scanned over 350450 packages my picture was taken and I was rewarded with a Dunkin Donuts card which I thought was funny considering we work for Amazon But it was nice to be acknowledged since there were so many people working there if you are a good worker you can pretty much work where you want or were you are most efficient but also be prepare to be pulled away if they need you somewhere else especially if you are considered one of the more efficient workers,It can be a toxic environment A lot of complaining about the work load mostly from the younger generation F this place N word was their mantra heard it every morning I would tell them just think of it as you are getting paid to workout Because they have a vending machine with gear in case you lose yours people tend to abuse this and not keep tracked of their equipment Parking lot would get littered with gloves and vests If you were a fast and efficient worker they would move you around to pick up the slack of the slower employees Some of these people were barely working making it frustrating for the people like myself who were scanning 3x the packages they were for the same pay Management or the leaders they had on the floor were mostly young and were not trained to be leaders or have a proper work etiquette We all have name tags and one of these young punks kept saying hey you yeah you to me on several occasions when I advised him my name is on the tag and to address me properly and respectfully or dont address me at all He no longer called on me from that time on nor did he apologies I was a warehouse manager for 8 years before working in IT and never treated my workers like they were cattle Another big problem is some of these people were not even competent enough to scan the freight onto the pallet Normally first box gets scanned to the pallet it goes to and after that you can scan freight to the box already on the pallet This process was challenging for some and if you are working with this person then you usually get pulled aside with them even though you werent at fault I would now have not only scan my freight but rescan their freight in I tried to explain this to leadership and advise who was the problem but they rather pull a whole group aside instead of the the individual making the mistake Bottom line when you scan something in right it has a different tone beep and goes green showing it was scanned successfully and it does the opposite if you dont scan it in properly This is not rocket science,Seasonal Warehouse Associate,Former Employee,Avenel NJ,Feb 25 2023

7540,4,A Great Place to Work with Its Pros and Cons,Amazon is a fantastic place to work if you appreciate a fastpaced and dynamic work environment Teams and individuals are encouraged to quickly adapt to changing priorities which can be a pro for some but may not be suitable for everyone The Correction of Errors process helps eliminate the blame game that often occurs during outages at other companies Working in networking at Amazon offers unique and challenging problems that are difficult to find elsewhere NDEs network development engineers are given the opportunity to work on the problems that interest them even if it means switching teams The company has high hiring standards which means youll be surrounded by bright and diverse individuals,The constant change of priorities can have negative sideeffects Your project might have its scope altered or even cancelled altogether The companys organizational structure has changed every 3 years or so and theres often a tradeoff between longterm personal development and shortterm goals If youre interested in pursuing nonAmazon technical development or certifications be prepared to invest personal time and money The combined effect of these factors has made my experience disappointing Ive reported to seven different managers in my time with the company which has made it difficult to advance However experiences at Amazon vary widely depending on your team and focus and some teams are better than others I strongly recommend vetting your manager and team thoroughly before accepting a position Finally the scale of Amazon requires teams to focus on a smaller part of the bigger picture which can result in siloed teams and individuals Some teams do a good job of balancing their narrow focus with a broader perspective but this is not always the case especially in networking,Network Development Engineer,Current Employee,Seattle WA,Feb 9 2023
7550,1,Worst Work Experience Of My Entire Life And This Is The Fashion Industry,The ability to work from home,Everything from poor management working until 1am working every single weekend without even rotations for all stylists low employee morale low pay lack of investment and appreciation for employees This was the absolute worst job Ive ever had in my entire life all for them to lay us off at the start of the new year One of the most toe curling experiences from this job was their decision to move stylists to a bidding scheduling system which made some employees no longer have 8 hours to work in one day This caused some employees to create a 40 hour work week with random 1hour blocks of time that were leftover This could cause random splits of time in our work day or create 10hour work days on weekends It was complete nonsense,Stylist,Former Employee,Atlanta GA,Feb 16 2023

7570,4,Easy work very lonely,The work was very easy Training took under two days and was paid for Hours are pretty much guaranteed and you can choose your shifts You work at your own station and can just zone out for a few hours,Close to no human interaction throughout your shift Sometimes I went the entire day without saying a single word to anyone It also takes a while to be noticed and promoted Usually you are just transferred to another position,Warehouse Associate Picker,Former Employee,Beaumont CA,Feb 18 2023
7580,3,Not all Managers are viewed equally tech functions are hypervalued over nontech,Great place to learn and add to a resume,can be very autocratic environment While they are portraying themselves as an open and fair environment the feeling of inclusion and openness will tend to diminish exponentially as you go up the management ladder The leadership principal of disagree and commit only really works in a downward fashion and almost never as an upward option,Snr Manager,Former Employee,Seattle WA,Mar 17 2023
7590,3,Good place to work for now but culture is changing,Brilliant people a lot of opportunities internally decent pay and benefits Happiness is largely dependent on the team you end up on,The culture is shifting and not in a positive way The RTO mandate is having a huge detremental impact on employees and doesnt align with the tech survey results Amazon will end up losing top talent and will have difficulty in recruiting new talent if they require they live near a hub This was a huge break in trust for so many people when we were previously told that we wouldnt be required to return to the office becasue wed proven that were were more productive and effective with more flexible work arrangements,Anonymous Employee,Current Employee,Tucson AZ,Feb 27 2023

7610,4,A lot of opportunities but accountability is hard to come by,Ive never worked for a company that allows you to explore and develop any and all of the ideas that you want People skills are hard to develop within operations so they lean on HR a lot for those skills which means that you get the freedom to develop your own ideas and implement new ways to approach situations,Working HR at Amazon can be incredibly stressful and downright dangerous at times They cut staffing and yet your operational leaders make more and more demands of you every day when they arent even held accountable to their own metrics,HR Business Partner,Current Employee,nan,Feb 3 2023

7640,3,Started 5 ended 3,I loved working from home for Amazon the first year I thought I found my dream job The training was great when I struggled my team leader was great at helping My schedule was every 3 weeks we did a shift bid of avail hours that would be my schedule for the next 3 weeks You could swap with coworker before using pto Work load was stressful at times but manageable,After you get comfortable with your position they switch your department rather you want to or not Then increase your workload I started 1 call or chat at a time with a occasional email then they started to expect you to take a call 2 chats at a time I have ADHD it was very hard for me Then they would take away your yes from a customer review if that customer called back for any reason in a 48hr period Even if it was to request to leave a good review to a manager about your customer service So when you get yes turned to no they black out the hours avail on your shift bid I would be forced to work every weekend or do split shifts or 2 hrs on 2 hrs off all day,Customer Service Representative,Former Employee,Seattle WA,Mar 9 2023

8350,4,The experience is what you make of it,Amazon has talented employees who truly embody the characteristics outlined in the leadership principles Most of the people you encounter to solve problems will work diligently with you to solve the issue presented to them Youll learn an extensive range of topics related to your role in a short period of time which may be used later in your tenure to assist a different team Depending on the team you will be pushed to learn as much as possible and challenged to dive deep with each concern,You will be pulled in to support on going issues at any given hour dependent on the severity of the issue,Technical Program Manager,Current Employee,nan,Jan 22 2023

8410,5,Fantasic oppertunity working with brillient people,Competitive pay focused on customers Obsessed with customer creates a clear path to learn and be curious strong bias for action aka focus and hard work really is a guild to promotion The culture is lived at Amazon Not just a bumper stickers you read once a year when the annual report is published you can feel the Leadership Principles very day in every meeting,The hiring process is to long ownership means vetting at manager levels not so nearly effective as the firm would like them to be 7 hours of interviews when perhaps 2 or 3 hours would work as well All based on the principal that AZ would rather interview 50 times and not hire than hire the wrong person I think allowing for evaluation and behavior vetting in a more stream line way gets there only faster,Sales Executive,Current Employee,Dallas TX,Jan 5 2023
8420,3,Great benefits but difficult to climb Corporate ladder,Entering into Amazon offers excellent benefits on paper International recognition free training of 5200 per year after as little of 90 days employment Solid pay periods banking support within the Amazon Network,Very little to no recognition by local Management easy to get approved training but very difficult to find support thereafter for the same approved training Micro Management to a point that few Managers have vision outside their own department A 40 hour work week often feels like 50,Water Spider General Labor,Current Employee,Sparrows Point OptionalMD,Feb 27 2023

8450,4,Leadership Principles Career Opportunities and Rate of Injuries,Amazon has the absolute best Leadership Principles I have ever experienced When they are followed they produce the greatest results and that is what makes Amazon so great Amazon also has some of the most committed leaders Ive ever had the pleasure of working with There is a significant and noticeable difference between those that always do whats right and those that just tell you what you want to hear Most of the time Ops will come around and make the necessary changes without putting up a fight Know when to move on by transferring to another site This is very site and Business Unit specific The grass truly is greener at other sites,When I started with Amazon the principle You own your career was encouraging and motivating Career opportunities are stunted by lack of shift rotation for proper exposure to the site leaders and lack of experience level by managers that dont know how to recognize talent and Develop the Best Reqs are often filled before they are opened and it has become about Who you know instead of what you have accomplished and what you have to contribute This creates barriers for those that are ready to be promoted relocating looking to transfer etc Amazon needs to get back to the preCovid standards across the board Its time for us to Return to Normal starting with the associate cell phones not being allowed on the FC floor The increased number of rest periods is having an adverse effect and increasing rate of injury Amazon has 20 years of operation prior to Covid and we need to use that data to drive the Safety Culture,Whs Specialist,Current Employee,Orlando FL,Feb 6 2023

8550,4,Depends on your team,Ive gotten very lucky in that I like everyone on my team and I love the team culture My manager is very approachable and helpful He does not mind what we do as long as we are achieving goals or reasonable progress Pretty decent WLB,Because Amazon is all about several smaller teams working together the experience varies heavily based on the team you are in I have heard horror stories of teams with a bad manager or having no work life balance,Software Development Engineer SDE,Current Employee,nan,Feb 13 2023
8560,4,Love my job but some changes are needed,Great pay managers PA friendly atmosphere,They have this thing called snappy gifts which you get as a incentive or for doing good job or in recognition or winnings and they gift tax you and take out of your paycheck which makes you feel really unappreciated and if you want to work full time you have to work swing shifts which isnt good for family life when you can add that shift as a VET and not as an full time employee shift makes no sense they should care about families so they are able to home with them and not be living at the work place so much,Associate,Current Employee,nan,Dec 28 2022

9800,4,Learning Ambassador,There is a lot of room for advancement I work at a SubSame Day warehouse for flex drivers so we have both the warehouse side and delivery side of the operation and we arent assigned specific roles like at normal stations On a given day you could do anywhere from two or more tasks so youre not stuck doing one thing all the time unless youre good at it then they tend to stick you there all the time,Its nothing more than what people usually say about Amazon theres a very uneven distribution of work especially when VTO is being given and the people who stay are left to pick up the work that was supposed to have been done for more people You are often doing multiple jobs at the same time,Warehouse Associate,Current Employee,Houston TX,Jan 9 2023

9840,5,Best Place to Work,Great Pay and benefits work from home and my peers are amazing I get to travel as part of my role supporting new launches and that has been a very rewarding perk to the job,Pay raises Amazon will give you stock as part of your promotion or yearly review but what they dont tell you is that it goes towards your total compensation so when you are due for a raise a year later you may very well be over your jobs salary cap and not get a raise due to having stocks vest and considered into your total comp Hypothetical Situation Lets say salary cap for your role is 70000 Your base salary is 65000 and you are awarded 10 stocks at 1000 for a total of 10000 that will vest over 4 years When its time for your raise they will add the 65000 and the 10000 together and say you are currently making 75000 and that is 5000 over the pay cap for this role so you will not be getting a raise this year It is very frustrating and annoying as most if not all new hires for Amazon come in with a stock sign on bonus so you are very much not likely to get a raise until your stocks all go away,Program Manager II,Current Employee,nan,Sep 7 2022

10020,2,Bashing my head against the wall,Easy to get in for first job if you meet the requirements bachelors in anything and can move to an available position Autonomy over time off even though its not enough time off,Overworked terrible schedule of which you have no say in pay is far too low for the amount and type of work expected Pay is also not location based which does not make any sense considering it is a fullyonsite role There is ZERO ability for negotiation or discussions about pay raises at least from L1 L4 Many issues with the promotion system If you even want to get to L5 in HR you must invent some problem and act the hell out of a pretend solution I am not supposed to be an actor I am supposed to be doing HR work They dont accept great work and the obvious ability to perform at the next level Not to mention the difference between HRP and HRBP L5 is just that they attend reginal meetings presenting the data that you gave them You also will not be promoted unless you manager is willing to vouch for you so you will have to kissup to them and basically beg for a promodoc They will make up reasons to say you are not ready even if they have said over and over that they have no feedback for you and you are a superstar and the best on the team Many people spend over a year in stretch roles where they are not given any extra pay or given a title increase but are doing the work of the next level And they are still not guaranteed that promotion when time comes Seen more than one get passed up for an outside hire Absolute nonsense If your in Sr leadership and your building metrics are not the best more than a few times they will fire you Doesnt matter the reason why the metrics are not met This on top of already terrible turnover rates mean I have had 34 HRBPs in 2 years and about 5 site leaders This is not to mention the desk work makes you wan to jump off a cliff Anyone can be hired as an associate and they will drive you crazy The turnover rate is insane for T1s and they act like its HRs fault for not having enough pizza parties and bingo days This means there are always new people who have questions everyday Associates will fight each other and do other nonsense that makes your job so much harder The bigger the building the worse the problems but at least they have more HR Small buildings are at gearing ratio but there is too much work and the small HR teams cannot keep up Ultimately not worth the amount of hoops they make you jump through I hear that the higher levels 56 outside of the warehouse are much more reasonable So if you want to work for Amazon come here to get your foot in the door with HR if you can handle the schedule and low pay in high COL areas ie no kids then get a better position and boomerang back to in a few years This will get you much more pay and a better position in way less time then the nonsense promotion system here,HR Partner,Current Employee,nan,Mar 4 2023

10140,2,0 job security be prepaired to be a robot,They have absoluly amazon benifits they have opperturnities that a lot of wearhouses dont have I feel Amazon treats their employees better than most werahouses They overtime options are really good and the overtime pay and potential yearly bonuses are very worth while during the peak season even though it is very exhausting,Even though I say Amzon has it going on for pros the management and systems they have in place to help employees are absolutly blurred ines just to fire you They have their PTO VTO and UPT unpaid time off all seperated and your upt is taken in hours away for being 1 minute late This is your emergency time that you can use but if you go negative you are fired by the system and if they have a schedule mistake doesnt matter no one checks anything please only use amazon as extra cash do not bank on having a job there if you are anything less than a perfect human being cause even a mistake will get you fired there,Inbound Problem Solver,Current Employee,Memphis TN,Dec 28 2022

10290,1,I can recommend Amazon warehouses only to those who really need good health insurance,The insurance coverage is the only benefit that makes this job worthwhile and thats only for the people who can make good use of it For anyone else look elsewhere,The rate they want you to work at for a shift that could be between 10 to 12 hours is really tiresome to deal with day in and day out particularly when they get to peakseason when theyll make you take an extra shift each week The student accommodation will immunize you against mandatory overtime but beyond that the time you can take off your schedule varies with who is working at HR for your site,nan,Former Employee,Avenel NJ,Feb 23 2023

10390,3,Good start but keep looking,Great benefits lots of autonomy many transfer opportunities learned a lot about myself and my management style with this job,Stress level can be very high due to a variety of factors outside of your control Building culture varies strongly so leadership turnover can be high or low Other departments HR Safety ERC RME IT etc can be unhelpful further increasing your burden Senior Ops tend to be full of themselves and equate tenure to knowledge Day to day tasks can get boring,Area Manager II,Current Employee,nan,Feb 20 2023

10410,2,Employee lack of loyalty to the companys success is tangible,Theres opportunity to suggest improvement and innovation as long as you dont need any help doing it,Most employees will openly state that they dont want to be at Amazon long They are there to accelerate their career which would be fine except their work and level of engagement reflect this The employees are definitely hard working and long hours are expected but a good percentage would rather get a quick win out of pointing out their peers failures than help resolve a problem Definitely take the time to overvocalize any successes you achieve do not depend on leadership to recognize wins without a white paper explaining why what you did mattered,Program Manager,Current Employee,Seattle WA,Jan 19 2023
10420,5,The willl you have to carry within soul to going on your Journey,The core values I got to embrace the fun and entertainment show how good of s job it is Didnt feel stress with have 200 deliveries a day My work ethic will always show what I dont want to sound like i am bragging,the deadlines to soo many co workers it can get easy to distrsct yourself from work,nan,Former Employee,Moreno Valley CA,Jan 28 2023

10490,3,Technical role Pay is great but be prepared to teach yourself everything,I was very happy with compensation and the role overall I had some great coworkers but I hear it varies from team to team of course I had the opportunity to lead large projects and learn a lot in a short amount of time,But you should be prepared to work very hard every day on often ambiguous projects You will need receive formal training and should expect to teach yourself how to be successful in your role Our team was yanked around left and right by our VP So it was difficult to predict what you would actually be working on from week to week or month to month,Anonymous Employee,Former Employee,nan,Feb 1 2023

10520,3,Stable job but the rules change constantly,Benefits Full time flexible hours paid time off,Every second of your time is tracked to be held against you even if you complete your goals The rules change constantly with no time given to adapt before you are held accountable Almost every change that gets made is made to increase the bottom line without consideration to how it interrupts the employees actual job processes We are often told to learn an entirely new process just to unlearn it when the systems finally get updated to match the new rules those two things almost never happen simultaneously,Quality Analyst,Current Employee,nan,Feb 17 2023

10640,4,Best place to grow your career,At Amazon AWS I have the best toolbox to learn and grow People here are respectful and high achievers They really abide by the Leadership Principles LP which can help you grow personally and professionally You can find many employee communities which makes it easier to belong and practice your culture Flexible although there is a lot to do Bias for Execution there is flexibility which allows for worklifebalance The LP of Hire and Develop the best means there is a lot of focus on employee wellbeing Compensation is competitive but Total Comp is also dependent upon RSUs and therefore share price,Difficult to get promoted not impossible You have to build a body of work showcasing your impact outside of daily responsibilities Since everyone here is a high achiever the bar is set quite high Large company can be difficult to get upwards visibility There seems to be too many services at AWS It allows AWS to innovate quickly but can get confusing to learn,Senior Solutions Architect,Current Employee,New York NY,Dec 15 2022
10650,5,Amazing place to work,I always heard that Amazon had the long hours and zero flexibility and hence was hesitant to join The hours can be long some days but its no different than other high performing companies When it comes to flexibility it really depends on your team and manager In my case we can start and end at anytime as long as the work is done Im grateful for this as I get to spend time with my family as well,Amazon recently started firing people something which they have not done before So there is a sense of fear among all teams these days,Finance Manager,Current Employee,Dallas TX,Jan 26 2023

10680,4,Was one of the best jobs I ever had,Because their was a productive system in where everyone would work and when anyone need help in the department they would help you And Amazon had a charity foundation where costumers would pick their own choice of charity and amazon would give charity there,That amazon had ended their charity foundation even though they are one of the biggest companys out there,Maketing,Former Employee,nan,Feb 13 2023

14800,4,Learning Ambassador,There is a lot of room for advancement I work at a SubSame Day warehouse for flex drivers so we have both the warehouse side and delivery side of the operation and we arent assigned specific roles like at normal stations On a given day you could do anywhere from two or more tasks so youre not stuck doing one thing all the time unless youre good at it then they tend to stick you there all the time,Its nothing more than what people usually say about Amazon theres a very uneven distribution of work especially when VTO is being given and the people who stay are left to pick up the work that was supposed to have been done for more people You are often doing multiple jobs at the same time,Warehouse Associate,Current Employee,Houston TX,Jan 9 2023

14890,5,Best Place to Work,Great Pay and benefits work from home and my peers are amazing I get to travel as part of my role supporting new launches and that has been a very rewarding perk to the job,Pay raises Amazon will give you stock as part of your promotion or yearly review but what they dont tell you is that it goes towards your total compensation so when you are due for a raise a year later you may very well be over your jobs salary cap and not get a raise due to having stocks vest and considered into your total comp Hypothetical Situation Lets say salary cap for your role is 70000 Your base salary is 65000 and you are awarded 10 stocks at 1000 for a total of 10000 that will vest over 4 years When its time for your raise they will add the 65000 and the 10000 together and say you are currently making 75000 and that is 5000 over the pay cap for this role so you will not be getting a raise this year It is very frustrating and annoying as most if not all new hires for Amazon come in with a stock sign on bonus so you are very much not likely to get a raise until your stocks all go away,Program Manager II,Current Employee,nan,Sep 7 2022

15490,3,Great Team Poor WLB,I really enjoy working with my specific team at Amazon Theyre very fun and we have good camaraderie Another thing I like about working at Amazon is that everything I do is something Im trying for the first time Work is usually not boring because there is always a new challenge to solve,At Amazon there is a belief that it is best to keep teams scrappy and that this will contribute to the companys success because it will make people continue to invent and simplify I personally have not found this policy to have this intended effect One of the most immediate things I noticed working at Amazon is that the internal tooling is horrifically maintained and makes most of your job like pushing a boulder uphill as method after method that you take to find a solution turns out to be a deadend or not to be feasible because of some techdebt quick hack that some other team or your team took that now limits the range of options you have available to you I think this is due to customer obsession everything that does not pertain to a customerrelated launch is deprioritized into obscurity I feel also that there is a sense of willful blindness at the company a curious doublethink where work life balance is strongly encouraged and all management is advocating for it but the timelines that are set are so aggressive that they push developers to the limit and make it impossible to achieve At its heart I dont think this is an intentional blindness rather I think it comes from the simple fact that technical unknowns tend to slow a project not to speed it up and high level management is working with more levels of uncertainty than lower level teams,SDEI,Current Employee,nan,Jan 31 2023

15800,5,I love working for Amazonand Im really not trying to leave but…,Only thing that I can say—thats clear —is the Amazon internal structure was designed from the beginning to take care of its employeesand pardon the pun but Amazon delivers Pay is fair to excellent benefits are active from day one there’s usually as much overtime as anyone would want promotions bonuses access to stock purchases paid training for extra certifications and qualifications etc A day after working hard at Amazon is well felt when one arrives home to spend quiet evenings with loved ones,Huge huge company sometimes Amazon feels unmanageable cultures vary between facilities and regions Work environment behavioral culture can lack esteem pride and generally optimistic credence andor proactivity This is highly variable howevermost facilities have a decent work culture but parts of Amazon are very transient due to the size of Amazon Management is civil and required to exercise maturity when dealing with employees regardless of other reviews the truth about Amazon is that the leadership management cannot be abusive to employees under any circumstances Amazon policy is to terminate abusive management or demote with impunity however management does play games and they know it with other employees especially when earned promotions are due promotions that are due may be obstructed andor outright prevented usually in the name of exclusivity Organizational cohesion is a real challenge at Amazon and very difficult to maintain due to the size of Amazon however it is not impossible to achieve and Amazon provides the necessary training to achieve it While the next aspect is not overwhelming or prohibitive from enjoying working for amazon it is noticeable sometimes Amazons culture feels completely unmanageable and most internal employees will experience a feeling of being excluded ao generally forgotten Self sufficiency and autonomy of employees is requisite for all employees yet this is a tacit expectation that is not emphasized enough compared to the practicalities of the typical Amazon work environments Amazon is actually not a company that will cooperate with employees who are exploring resignation optionsmeaning that if an employee is an established performer at Amazon and is considering changing jobs Amazon may actively obstruct the resignation in some manner,Transportation Engineer,Current Employee,nan,Jan 13 2023

17760,5,HIGHLY Recommend for HR,I HIGHLY recommend Amazon as an employer particularly operating in the field to fast track your career and enhance your career experience Amazon is the only company I have experienced that TRULY lives their leadership principles it is what your annual review touch bases promotions terminations projects everything is based on From these values you will know exactly what a successful Amazonian looks like Amazon enhances employees development by sending employees to launch sites or sites in need of additional help They also have temporary teams built that you can take part of to learn to specialize such as employee relations They want to promote people quickly and from within as often as possible If you want to try something and you can present a solid reason why they are willing to invest in you This is one of the best companies I have ever worked for If you are willing to put in the work you can triple your salary or more with stock options in 5 years I was able to double mine in 25 years Had I not wanted to own a business I would have stayed with Amazon for much longer If my business fails I would go back to Amazon in a heartbeat,I firmly believe you have to be in the right time of your life to support Amazon warehouses I would not work at Amazon if I had a children andor prioritized worklife balance depending on your position in this case HR manager L6 or below I would recommend it if youre single or a fresh college graduate In the field aka warehouses you will work 55 hours per work can be responsible for any shift and the PTO policy isnt great if you have a good boss they can make up for that You will have a lot of managers at Amazon some AMAZING and others TERRIBLE there is no in between If you want to promote FAST you will have to relocate to support launches That being said you can still promote quickly in your location but it will be faster in 1 a larger site 2000 people andor 2 a geographical area saturated with sites ex southern California It is a stressful job but you will learn a lot in a VERY short period of time When and if you are ready to leave the warehousesfield operations there are so MANY opportunities and business lines to explore I did this and found myself missing the grind of the warehouses immensely Specifically for HR I would try to join Amazon as an HRBP vs HR Partner if you have experience in HR 2 years If you are new to HR and serious about a career in it I would recommend starting as an HR partner and grinding away keep in mind this may require swingnight shifts There are people that have been promoted 45 times in 57 years from a position like that Overall if you want to grind in your career you could be VP status by 30 if youre lucky and worklife balance isnt a priority Amazon is a good fit for you Its not a bad thing its just a fit for a certain type of person,Senior HRBP,Former Employee,nan,Jan 6 2023

17800,2,Don’t get stuck here the pay is all it offers,Lots of room for advancement and growth pay is pretty great,Company is incredibly unpeople friendly and does the almost nothing to try to make people happy there Refuses to make changes to actual work flow or processes to improve the experience even after suggestions or feedback from the team As you move up higher there is even less care given to you as a person and you are treated more as a number tool to drive numbers Upper management will almost never leave the office or make efforts to speak to their team outside of bad conditions and will instead just use Slack to micromanage you from the office even though they are a 3 minute walk away,Area Manager,Current Employee,nan,Dec 31 2022

17850,5,Onboarding Advice,After completing two months of onboarding I am still quite happy I came aboard Amazon My advice would be to prioritize your training period and understand upfront there are multiple training platforms This gets confusing so slow down and utilize your partners to ensure you are on track,Too many training platforms and training session times can be misleading when there are trainings within trainings and links within links to review,HR Generalist III,Current Employee,nan,Jan 8 2023

17880,5,Great people,Everyone Ive met with and work with at Amazon is highly intelligent kind and helpful Its impressive to see a business Jeff Bezos created so many years ago still runs on the foundation he created which makes it such an impressive business model Youre encouraged to ask questions and to share your opinion here and people in other businesses across Amazon are willing to connect and help you too if you reach out and ask There is a lot of opportunity and growth here,Majority of things at Amazon are selfserve which in general really isnt a con and for the most part I think its a pro But if youre someone who does not feel comfortable figuring things out on your own 99 of the time doing the research doing new things while also understanding the Amazon way going to find the people and resources you need instead of being told what to do it might be difficult for you,Marketing,Current Employee,nan,Aug 30 2022

17970,1,Resume fodder,Your skills will be developed through trialbyfire The company provides a fantastic opportunity to collect resume fodder,The company loves to measure metrics for the sake of tracking metrics There is a huge focus on developing action plans to address poor metrics but the effort is placed on drafting action plans not executing said plans As long as the plan is recorded everyone is happy Much of your day is spent working on tasks that don’t add value to the business Site leadership tries hard to treat workers with respect but is often relegated by senior leadership to treat the workforce like children The hourly workforce responds appropriately to this behavior I’ve witnessed employees at all levels break down in tears,Human Resources Business Partner HRBP,Former Employee,nan,Jan 25 2023

19780,4,Great Career Opportunity possible downsides,Overall the position has been great and I learn a lot of skills for my future safety Career Amazon also pays for your OSHA 30 if you havent received it already which is nice for someone starting the field Overall the company is nice to work for and you get great benefits This specific position is still hourly so you can get overtime and you work 4 days on 10 hours so you get 3 days off,Depending on the building you get placed at this can determine your overall happiness or stress level Not all amazon buildings have the same structure and unfortunately bad leadership can make any aspect of safety difficult Some buildings also have too many older associates that are stuck in the ways of the past and this can sometimes make building a culture of safety difficult,Workplace Health and Safety Specialist,Current Employee,Atlanta GA,Sep 22 2022

19960,1,Grinds up smart competent people spits out their broken husks,Many very smart capable people work there Compensation at the low end of big tech but still above the overall industry average You learn a lot about how to make high throughput global software,You can only succeed in most of the company if you are a workaholic If you dont prioritize your job over everything else in your life youll be viewed as underperforming This has always been an issue with Amazon and the race to the bottom has only intensified in recent years It wasnt unusual to hear managers brag about how their team was the first one to start work in the morning and the last to leave Extreme churnandburn with employees in many teams People who want to do anything other than put in long hours for the company and step on their coworkers heads to advance their own career are quickly managed out If youre a kind decent person when you start a job here then chances are you either wont last long or you will come out the other side a nasty jerk Not truly a tech company Glaring on the retail side of things where most teams are full time working on keeping systems that barely worked when they were built a decade ago running while slowly replacing them with new systems that will be badly outdated when if they finally launch Even in AWS the retail ethos is pervasive and productbusiness interests perpetually trump investments in innovation and reducing tech debt Specifically as a manager the company is incredibly isolating and draining You have no peers every other manager is competition for funding stack ranking slots and promotions A constant stream of toxic antiworker policies and demands filter down through you You either have to be a good manager from Amazons perspective and put enough gold paint on the turds youre handing out to convince your reports that they should be thankful for them or be honest with your reports and paint a huge target on your own back Diversity and inclusion are FAR worse there than any other big tech company Ive seen Some managersdirectors are good about this But entire orgs in the Seattle HQ will be 90 people from mainland China or India Exclusionary social environments and blatant favoritism of the ingroup for performance and promotion evaluations are the norm Middle and upper management dont care,Software Development Manager,Former Employee,Seattle WA,Feb 8 2023

20090,4,Depends on where you land,NAME,The workforce is rapidly changing so it is not uncommon to find yourself a part of an expansion team where the most experienced member has been at Amazon for less than 3 years That can make it difficult to become acclimated to the project work and working at the company in general It also becomes difficult to gauge how you stack up within the organization when your own management is relatively new and learning the culture and standards themselves Depending on the team your workload will vary It isnt notoriously high across the board as public threads may seem to suggest The bottom line is that you will feel pressure to deliver quality work in a timely manner as your product will most likely be highly visible and served from infrastructure that can deploy in minutes AWS The emphasis on raising the bar means you will be challenged to never settle as new barraising talent is constantly flowing in,Software Engineer,Current Employee,nan,Oct 6 2022

20140,3,Headline,Flexible hours and non conflicting schedules,Flex up strenuous hours poor leadership and the inability to access benefits,Associate,Former Employee,Hazelwood MO,Mar 15 2023
20150,5,The leadership principles are not just something they say,Many companies give lip service to the building of leaders but Amazon truly embraces it from day one Having run my own company in the past I know firsthand how difficult it is to create and build a culture I was amazed that from day one my manager and my team have taken a sincere personal interest in my professional development and the desire to help me achieve my career goals There is equal emphasis on achieving short term and long term goals and everything we do is tied to the leadership principles that Amazon lives by from the top down,The only downside to working at Amazon is simply the sheer size of the organization and the intense need for data privacy Amazon is a place where you really need to leverage your ability to work across teams This isnt really a negative but it can be a daunting task As an ecommerce company that puts the customer first in every decision that is made data is very hard to access between teams This can make account penetration more challenging than you would hope While these are inconvenient I appreciate sharpening new skills and as a customer of Amazon I appreciate the data security,Business Development Manager,Current Employee,Boulder CO,Sep 14 2022

20370,5,Im home,They live their leadership principles in everything they do The ones I love the most are bias for action and customer obsession Amazon has the feel of a young scrappy company but the budget of a well established and successful company The training they give is well thought out and comprehensive You are encouraged to speak up if you have an opinion or disagree no matter your level or area of expertise Their peculiar ways are certainly what separates them and makes Amazon the success it is,In their quest to move quickly and get stuff done there is not as much focus on recognition and celebrating individuals,Senior Analyst,Current Employee,nan,Jan 10 2023

22230,5,I love working for Amazonand Im really not trying to leave but…,Only thing that I can say—thats clear —is the Amazon internal structure was designed from the beginning to take care of its employeesand pardon the pun but Amazon delivers Pay is fair to excellent benefits are active from day one there’s usually as much overtime as anyone would want promotions bonuses access to stock purchases paid training for extra certifications and qualifications etc A day after working hard at Amazon is well felt when one arrives home to spend quiet evenings with loved ones,Huge huge company sometimes Amazon feels unmanageable cultures vary between facilities and regions Work environment behavioral culture can lack esteem pride and generally optimistic credence andor proactivity This is highly variable howevermost facilities have a decent work culture but parts of Amazon are very transient due to the size of Amazon Management is civil and required to exercise maturity when dealing with employees regardless of other reviews the truth about Amazon is that the leadership management cannot be abusive to employees under any circumstances Amazon policy is to terminate abusive management or demote with impunity however management does play games and they know it with other employees especially when earned promotions are due promotions that are due may be obstructed andor outright prevented usually in the name of exclusivity Organizational cohesion is a real challenge at Amazon and very difficult to maintain due to the size of Amazon however it is not impossible to achieve and Amazon provides the necessary training to achieve it While the next aspect is not overwhelming or prohibitive from enjoying working for amazon it is noticeable sometimes Amazons culture feels completely unmanageable and most internal employees will experience a feeling of being excluded ao generally forgotten Self sufficiency and autonomy of employees is requisite for all employees yet this is a tacit expectation that is not emphasized enough compared to the practicalities of the typical Amazon work environments Amazon is actually not a company that will cooperate with employees who are exploring resignation optionsmeaning that if an employee is an established performer at Amazon and is considering changing jobs Amazon may actively obstruct the resignation in some manner,Transportation Engineer,Current Employee,nan,Jan 13 2023

23140,1,Your just another brick in the wallthe never ending wall,Flexibility with taking time off and changing schedules partial stock purchase plan and decent benefits,This place has a huge turnover due to the fact that management treats employees like numbers In the first year the facility was open it went thru a little over 4000 employees Some dont even make it thru the first shift The place is literally ran like a high school although some days it feels more like kindergarten due the childish behavior of some managers We have been working an extra day of mandatory overtime since October of 2022 due to a shortage of staff As soon as one batch is hired another batch leaves Mandatory overtime is called MET and sometimes it gets added to your schedule at the last minute If there is bad weather like the ice storm we had a few weeks ago they wont close the facility even though surrounding cities and schools shut down They said they would excuse peoples time but after the fact refused to do so and in some cases ask for pictures to prove you could not get out of your neighborhood Pretty petty childish behavior of them to cheat people out of their time like that There is a lot of favoritism bullying and intimidation by the managers The few good managers we have dont stay long or get moved to another area In the first year my area went thru about a dozen managers and the longest one stayed was about 5 months He was a pretty good guy but the constant stress of the place drove him back to the facility he came from in Memphis Our department just acquired a problem manager that was passed over to us by another department She has already ran off several good people in our area and about half of our department is now looking for a job or a transfer to another facility No one in the area wants to pick up shifts on her end of the week and work with her She has bullied several employees with health issues and put them in dangerous situations Forcing employees to work in situations that are not ergonomic and could cause injury Forcing employees to do very physical indirect task that they may not be physically able to do or desire to do and were not hired to do Dont let her see you talking to someone or she will question you about your conversation Upper management refuses to get rid of her and just lets it go on Its really sad because it could be a great place to work The facility has been open about a year and a half and most of the original employees are long gone The few of us who remain most likely will not be there much longer at the rate it is going There is just too many other good opportunities in the area that dont treat their employees like this company does,Outbound Packer,Current Employee,Little Rock AR,Feb 20 2023

23960,4,Good company for the right person,Good benefits program happy with the time off that is provided There is upwards mobility in certain networks fulfillmentoperations are where there is good opportunity to promote and promote quickly If you are in a support rolenetwork the mobility is still there but will take longer to promote Less moving parts outside of operations If you are interested in learning a lot about operations and day to day business protocol as well as improving certain business acumen this can be a really good opportunity to learn about metrics such as cost and quality as well as a great opportunity to learn how to manage people in general,Hours can be inhumane at times I have worked shifts clear over 13 hours They claim safety as a number one priority but scrutinize when operational efficiency is impacted due to rising safety concerns or new safety protocol The company tends to be not as competitive with their pay scale in certain areas due to their ability to continue to hire new associates instead of looking to retain their associates with higher financial compensation packages There is a lot of opportunity for more support to be provided to this role Often it feels as you are on your own so to speak and need to figure it out Which can be a good thing if you are a proficient problem solver and enjoy owning certain tasks,Assistant Manager,Current Employee,nan,Aug 16 2022

24150,2,Love the company as a consumer hate it as an employee,Some benefits are good such as various medical options mental health support a few timeoff options The company is large enough so often its possible to relocate to another facility Its a good employer for homeless people,Extremely poor to no training absolute lack of standardization and consistency they use what they call Highjudgement decision making to justify each individual decision based on subjective factor such as the managers mood their personality The feeling I have is that the company is growing so much there is not enough qualified labor so they just hire anyone Then when they finally hire a good employee they wont stay due to the total mess disorganization and toxic environment They treat their employees ruthlessly and they see them as numbers People get fired for wrong reasons out of the blue and when the associate wants to explain why their termination was wrong they dont give the right of appealing to everyone Sometimes no one shows up for the appeal and they keep having to reschedule The policies are outdated thats WHEN they have at least a date so we can know which one is the most updated one You ask dozens of employees from different departments for a simple answer and sometimes very often to be honest it is just impossible to find an answer They say you should disagree and commit but guess what happens when you give a manager feedback even in the nicest way They retaliate against you One may say but they have a nonretaliation policy Do you know how hard it is to prove retaliatory behavior They will do anything to protect management and the most you will get is oh that is just their management style well work on that If your manager works remotely they will probably show up once a week or every other week for a half an hour discussion that is usually just a formality and no matter what you say they are always too busy to follow up with your concerns If you are an Amazonian that has ever tried to get HR support especially if your building doesnt have an HR you know how hard it can be to get your issue fixed I have so many bad things to say about the company I feel sick just to think about them Best day in years was when I decided to resign First good night of sleep in a very long time,Sr HR Assistant,Former Employee,nan,Feb 1 2023

24210,3,Good hours but too much micromanagingfavoritism,Can always work 40 hrs even if you are a parttime associate by picking up shifts on the app Fair pay for someone who didnt go to college Started at 15 and then there is a step plan and you max out at about 1618 after like 34 years Only work 4 days in a week Work four 10 hr shifts and have 3 days off Set schedule so u can plan out your vacations in advance,Long work days 10 hr work days During peak season holiday season you work 5 days in a row all 12 hr shifts It is mandatory overtime Managers always on your case for having time off task which is how much time you spent away and not working Like I went to the bathroom Calm down Favoritism is alive and well Got to buddy up with managers to get water spider roleproblem solver Little to no room to advance Its all rates rates and rates Managers always bug u everyday if your rates are low Tell you to get it higher Like I dont control what type of items I get on my sleigh If I get big items all day I cant stow it as fast as someone who has a water spider buddy and gets all the smalls Yes get a water spider buddy Make a new friend with benefits They will give u small items to stow all day and you will have good rates,Stow Associate,Former Employee,nan,Aug 16 2022

24270,3,Read below,Competitive compensation My organization is internal facing so it has reasonable expectations and work is reasonably paced Related oncall isn’t terrible usually but can fluctuate Resume boost from Amazon name brand Remote friendly Internal politics can be tiresome but generally at lower levels you can ignore them this is also easier now with full remote Another benefit of full remote don’t have to interact with highly “Amazonian” managers and PMs in person who are bouncing off the wall making requests and asking status updates at your desk team room common areas and lunch,Working here cultivates apathy I see a lot of talented and passionate people morph into lifeless drones This can be due to uninspiring projects nonstimulating work or perhaps other reasons Some huge egos at higher levels that are difficult to work with and generally unpleasant to be around will speak condescendingly and even say explictly that other teams and coworkers are idiots useless etc Paging system of autoescalation is designed to glue you to computer during shift or else risk an escalation to directors and VPs Overload of documents surrounding career growth and metrics such as level guidelines and leadership principles You constantly have to be documenting and discussing this This could be a pro for some people However these metrics can detract from doing your job well and making the most impact for customers Amazon tends to attract more “ladder climber” types than other companies Probably not the best place for someone who wants to just focus on getting work done in peace You may have to pretend you care about climbing the Amazon corporate ladder else your manager will think you’re coasting and manage you out Related managers tend to be under a lot of stress due to broken systems they’re forced to comply with You can read more about this elsewhere They generally do their best to shield employees from this One of my former managers consistently appeared to be under a great deal of stress Eventually he had a heart attack Without adequate information I can’t comment on whether work stress was linked to this,Software Development Engineer SDE II,Current Employee,nan,Jan 8 2023

24420,3,Great Team Poor WLB,I really enjoy working with my specific team at Amazon Theyre very fun and we have good camaraderie Another thing I like about working at Amazon is that everything I do is something Im trying for the first time Work is usually not boring because there is always a new challenge to solve,At Amazon there is a belief that it is best to keep teams scrappy and that this will contribute to the companys success because it will make people continue to invent and simplify I personally have not found this policy to have this intended effect One of the most immediate things I noticed working at Amazon is that the internal tooling is horrifically maintained and makes most of your job like pushing a boulder uphill as method after method that you take to find a solution turns out to be a deadend or not to be feasible because of some techdebt quick hack that some other team or your team took that now limits the range of options you have available to you I think this is due to customer obsession everything that does not pertain to a customerrelated launch is deprioritized into obscurity I feel also that there is a sense of willful blindness at the company a curious doublethink where work life balance is strongly encouraged and all management is advocating for it but the timelines that are set are so aggressive that they push developers to the limit and make it impossible to achieve At its heart I dont think this is an intentional blindness rather I think it comes from the simple fact that technical unknowns tend to slow a project not to speed it up and high level management is working with more levels of uncertainty than lower level teams,SDEI,Current Employee,nan,Jan 31 2023

24550,1,Employee Driver,Adventure you get to go to places youd probably never go to depending on your delivery areafor better or for worse If you really have nowhere to turn in terms of finding employment this job isnt the worst one out there It really depends on the area youre delivering at and the company you sign up with Amazon hires smaller companies to hire drivers keep that in mind But hear me now you deserve better Put in the time and effort to find the job you deserve because Amazon will not treat you like a person Theyll treat you like a mule This should only be a job taken as a last resort,In the years Ive worked at Amazon being a delivery driver since 2019 only one time can I say that Amazon has made a change for the Drivers benefit Every other change theyve made in a Drivers job has only made things more difficult to accomplish a route Whether its the rabbit app or the mentor app everything in the company is designed in a meticulous way to create obstacles for the driver with no incentive to maintain their ridiculous level of standards Except for not being fired Theyll ask you questions look for your opinion but its all placebos Changes are not made to help drivers I dont hate the people I directly work with My dispatch is pretty awesome But every day I live in fear that Amazon is going to introduce yet another rule or update to their apps to make delivering harder The biggest con is that Amazon does not care about you as a person As I said in the pros section youre a mule a robot someone theyll squeeze every ounce of work out of and toss you aside when you cant work no more Im going to dive into some darker stories here during my time at Amazon so dont read on if you dont want to hear it This is your warning Id heard that a delivery guy had gotten mauled to death by a couple of dogs They didnt find his body till the morning Which is awful since the vans are tracked Should have found him that night But I wasnt there so I cant say for certain what could and couldnt have been done What I can say for certain is that the only thing Amazon did after this incident was add a little warning system on their app which allows drivers to report dogs at a location I hope that mans family got something from Amazon as compensation but somehow I doubt it I myself had gotten attacked by a dog luckily not nearly as brutally as that man It comes with the territory sadly it can happen But what infuriated me about the situation was not that I was attacked but that I had been asking to get out of that dangerous area for a while Despite my preferred area being somewhere else I literally put in their system that I preferred a certain area they continuously send me to a dangerous place that I am simply not cut out to do And sure enough I was attacked by a dog in this area Id hoped this would have shown them that yeah maybe we should send this driver somewhere where theyll excel instead of fail but no the next week they had me deliver to the same house I was attacked There are also the writeups youll get because Amazon is too lazy to clean up its own messes An Amazon locker I had to deliver to daily had its scanner broken meaning we have to type in the packages individual codes which are 15 digits long I had 40 packages for this locker which meant I had to type in 600 different characters This of course was in the burning sun live in the hotter part of the US and I still had a full route to complete after this Luckily for me I was able to deliver it to the campus mailroom instead of having to do all that I called up Amazon Locker Services to have it fixed and they said theyd get it done so thered be no future problems This locker was on a college campus that consistently gets packages delivered to it so this is a problem I figured theyd want to take care of right away This was months ago Recently I found out a girl on our team found herself in the same situation and did the same as me She got a 2nd tier writeup theres only one above it for not delivering to the locker In other words Amazon unwilling to get the locker fixed would rather you spend hours in the burning sun typing in 600 characters and complete your route afterward instead of simply fixing THEIR machine theyd been told is broken And if you dont then youre getting written up There are so many more situations I could write about in my years working at Amazon but TLDR youre expendable to them so dont expect to be treated in a humane way Youre a tool nothing more And you deserve more than that Dont work here Find something that will bring you joy I promise you Amazon wont,Delivery Driver,Current Employee,nan,Jan 29 2023

24580,5,HIGHLY Recommend for HR,I HIGHLY recommend Amazon as an employer particularly operating in the field to fast track your career and enhance your career experience Amazon is the only company I have experienced that TRULY lives their leadership principles it is what your annual review touch bases promotions terminations projects everything is based on From these values you will know exactly what a successful Amazonian looks like Amazon enhances employees development by sending employees to launch sites or sites in need of additional help They also have temporary teams built that you can take part of to learn to specialize such as employee relations They want to promote people quickly and from within as often as possible If you want to try something and you can present a solid reason why they are willing to invest in you This is one of the best companies I have ever worked for If you are willing to put in the work you can triple your salary or more with stock options in 5 years I was able to double mine in 25 years Had I not wanted to own a business I would have stayed with Amazon for much longer If my business fails I would go back to Amazon in a heartbeat,I firmly believe you have to be in the right time of your life to support Amazon warehouses I would not work at Amazon if I had a children andor prioritized worklife balance depending on your position in this case HR manager L6 or below I would recommend it if youre single or a fresh college graduate In the field aka warehouses you will work 55 hours per work can be responsible for any shift and the PTO policy isnt great if you have a good boss they can make up for that You will have a lot of managers at Amazon some AMAZING and others TERRIBLE there is no in between If you want to promote FAST you will have to relocate to support launches That being said you can still promote quickly in your location but it will be faster in 1 a larger site 2000 people andor 2 a geographical area saturated with sites ex southern California It is a stressful job but you will learn a lot in a VERY short period of time When and if you are ready to leave the warehousesfield operations there are so MANY opportunities and business lines to explore I did this and found myself missing the grind of the warehouses immensely Specifically for HR I would try to join Amazon as an HRBP vs HR Partner if you have experience in HR 2 years If you are new to HR and serious about a career in it I would recommend starting as an HR partner and grinding away keep in mind this may require swingnight shifts There are people that have been promoted 45 times in 57 years from a position like that Overall if you want to grind in your career you could be VP status by 30 if youre lucky and worklife balance isnt a priority Amazon is a good fit for you Its not a bad thing its just a fit for a certain type of person,Senior HRBP,Former Employee,nan,Jan 6 2023

nan,5,Best place to experience data at scale,Amazon has some great leadership principles which are put into action in day to day life at Amazon It is hard to forget them as they show up in every meeting you are in and every deliverable you make There are few powerful mechanisms inbuilt into the culture where there are systems that you can leverage to page any team and cut tickets to any team I am also impressed with Amazons writing culture There is no powerpoint here hence no scope for misinterpretation as a reader As a writer its hard to write docs that are crisp and effective But you will get support from your own team or outside your team to get feedback on the docs You will see a very active set of groups who are ever ready to give you feedback and thus help raising the bar on the overall quality of your doc The feedback culture may sound critical but everyone is trained on how to be respectful while passing feedback Things like these leaves a good impression and very encouraging place to work High quality Engineers under one roof The hiring process is solid and non compromising It is ok to reject 50 candidates but hire the best are some of the unofficial principles that will create a lasting impression on you Lot of great teams here you will find great opportunities open for internal transfer,You are successful provided you are good at writing Just by being someone with big ideas and proved execution in the past will not make you successful here You will have to write write a lot and be good at writing to be successful,Sr Systems Developer,Current Employee,Seattle WA,Apr 28 2022

nan,3,It wouldve been fine if performance expectations stayed consistent,I was a warehouse worker packing boxes I liked that for the most part I was left to my devices to do my one job and it didnt require a lot of multi tasking or interacting with a customer interface It was easy to fix things like issues with PTO and UPT with the HR Chatbot When I was able to speak to HR in person they took my concerns seriously,The expected rate is constantly fluctuating mostly based on top performers I stayed in the middle for most of my time there and had to quit because in the last month it increased so drastically that I was in the bottom percentage My position in particular did feel very isolated but that might be a pro to some people For me it was a bit of both a pro and con The breakrooms and the bathrooms are so far from the working floor you barely have time for your scheduled breaks or any bathroom breaks you may need HR is also constantly understaffed and most of the time impossible to find There were days where it felt like I searched the whole building for an HR representative and found no one,Amazon Associate Tier I,Former Employee,nan,Aug 25 2022

nan,2,HR is a nightmare,Certain managers are really helpful to the best of their abilities The break room has a wide selection of items to purchase for snacking pick me up You are provided gloves blades and vests at no cost to you,There are some interesting folks there… but mostly my cons would be with HR Especially when there was a huge COVID outbreak in the beginning of 2022 HR gave the run around with how to handle leave and apparently if you had COVID and then A few weeks later your child had COVID and you needed leave to attend to them they only granted ONE COVID leave even after approving it And there’s no way to physically speak to someone in an HR office as they will only direct you to the HR hotline because they “don’t handle COVID leaves” but that only gets you so far because the hotline constantly hangs up on you or the email threads don’t put you with a live specialist just copy paste prompts irrelevant to your unique situations All in all the attitude from HR in my experience was subpar and even after actively seeking help multiple times and not getting the basic information needed I quit Ironically when I quit a few weeks later someone reached out to me regarding my leave and I then explained the situation and never heard from them again,Fulfillment Associate,Former Employee,Sacramento CA,May 17 2022

nan,1,Terrible Experience,Can work at any time of day,Monotonous work No human to human interaction Managed by a device have to meet strict quotas,Seasonal Warehouse Associate,Former Employee,Langhorne PA,Feb 20 2023
nan,1,Bottom Line over People,The best part of my experience was the people I worked with The most diverse group of individuals I have ever encountered who taught me so much kept a smile on my face and genuinely became my sole motivation for work You will meet the best people here unfortunately the high ups dont interact with the associates who actually run Amazon and their needs are subsided,Overtime During Peak last year I was working 65 hour work weeks with no overtime and no night differential We were expected to put in 3x the work during the holiday season without any real benefit As a manager you dont get the perks that hourly employees get like two breaks overtime holiday pay and any other benefits throughout the year Management is separate from associates and has unbelievably high expectations for compensation that is lets say not reflective of the work It is no wonder the turnover is so high The first 6 months of my job I didnt take a lunch break because it was frowned upon to ever be off the floor The second part of my tenure I made sure I took a 30 minute break every night to eat and escape the craziness but they told me that I shouldnt leave the building Policing I cant even describe how much of my time was wasted policing associates I felt like a high school principal trying to get students in trouble If you didnt give out enough written warnings every night you had to go out of your way to look for people doing something wrong So instead of helping my associates with problems they faced day to day or working to achieve long term goals with them or dedicating any time to fix the endless mechanical and technical problems faced on the daily I had to spend my time going around my department trying to catch someone on their phone or off task or not doing their job in some other way I used to have to go through everyones time cards from the day before find the people off task the most and spend my time reprimanding the few strays who werent doing their job effectively ignoring the needs of all the associates who show up and do the right thing everyday It was ridiculous and what made me lose my connections with the people and therefore my work Turnover You could never get comfortable As soon as you had a routine there were new associates or new managers or new ways to do the process or new rules or new write ups you had to give It is a constantly revolving door that goes around and around without making any real progress People were fired every day and new people came in practically every week No adjustment period no getting comfortable just work and work and work and pick up the pieces along the way Do your best theyd say But I need to see more results I was constantly putting out fires on a sinking ship Management I was at Amazon for a little over a year and I saw a multitude of leadership transitions Its very cutthroat and I lost too many good leaders who moved to other jobs after not getting their welldeserved promotion On the contrary I had too many managers who were insufficient at their jobs and stayed in leadership positions simply because they were willing to be miserable for a paycheck They cared about themselves their careers their opportunities and ABOVE ALL how YOU made them look to THEIR bosses I would be on the floor making real time quick decisions based on what I thought was best for the associates and operation and I would be reprimanded because some higher up across the country looking at a screen of data didnt like that decision didnt think it was worth it didnt see the positive result in the performance data I constantly had to compete safety with performance instead of wholly prioritizing safety and putting performance on the back burner until the situation is resolved Amazon is a giant company and unfortunately to a giant company its all a numbers game I used to defend Amazon I wanted to be the difference I wanted to change the narrative boy was I naive I quickly learned that I was caring for my people way more than any manager was caring for me And that being a good leader didnt get you recognized or praised being a good manager did A good manager does the reports on time and listens to their boss and does what is best for the company A good leader looks out for their people and creates a team environment in which we can all thrive I created a beautiful synergy in my first department on my own I was a great leader and the associates would tell you they loved me In my second department I wasnt given the time or freedom to create meaningful relationships and was forced to go into strictly manager mode Listen to your boss and do what youre told even if you dont think its the right thing to do for the people Working with people especially the number of people I was working with 100 requires a certain level of nuance I was working with all different ages ethnicities backgrounds and financial situations and as easy as it would be to throw a blanket over everyone and treat them the same theres no equity in that Maybe it just wasnt the job for me but I used to love it As soon as I was forced to set my morals aside for the betterment of the company I knew I was out,Area Manager II,Former Employee,Baltimore MD,Jan 5 2023

nan,5,Best place to experience data at scale,Amazon has some great leadership principles which are put into action in day to day life at Amazon It is hard to forget them as they show up in every meeting you are in and every deliverable you make There are few powerful mechanisms inbuilt into the culture where there are systems that you can leverage to page any team and cut tickets to any team I am also impressed with Amazons writing culture There is no powerpoint here hence no scope for misinterpretation as a reader As a writer its hard to write docs that are crisp and effective But you will get support from your own team or outside your team to get feedback on the docs You will see a very active set of groups who are ever ready to give you feedback and thus help raising the bar on the overall quality of your doc The feedback culture may sound critical but everyone is trained on how to be respectful while passing feedback Things like these leaves a good impression and very encouraging place to work High quality Engineers under one roof The hiring process is solid and non compromising It is ok to reject 50 candidates but hire the best are some of the unofficial principles that will create a lasting impression on you Lot of great teams here you will find great opportunities open for internal transfer,You are successful provided you are good at writing Just by being someone with big ideas and proved execution in the past will not make you successful here You will have to write write a lot and be good at writing to be successful,Sr Systems Developer,Current Employee,Seattle WA,Apr 28 2022

nan,4,Its alright if you are looking for an easy place to move,Fast growth and promotion happen quickly There is a gap from hourly to salary where you can make more as a top hourly over the bottom salary in my area due to overtime and you will likely hit that point as an hourly with peak season around the holidays and possible incentives,Lack of experience in a good amount of the leadership and sometimes you find a lack of logical direction There is a number of college hires that have to be met at times to take management roles and this may lead to experienced associates that are due to have to wait to get a position In my personal experience people with awesome management experience in manufacturing or warehouse outside of Amazon that comes into management tend to leave after a short amount of time because they may be reporting to less experienced managers above them and have to deal with their growth and development rather than utilizing what they already know,Process Assistant,Current Employee,West Jefferson OH,Jun 6 2022

nan,5,Fun place to work,Everyone is very welcoming at Amazon and while there is a ton to learn Ive never felt swallowed by my work load I can always rely on my team to help me through any time I get stuck Team sizes are relatively small 215 people so its pretty easy to get to know everyone on your team The pay is pretty great too The worklife balance is pretty good The worst part being on call stints but on call time is split between the entire team so you dont have to do it that often,There is a lot to learn and you will often find outdated information I suppose thats the nature of working at one of the largest companies in the world It is generally left up to the people working in a particular discipline to update documentation which is both a blessing because you can feel free to make changes to anything but also a curse because things fall out of date easily when everyone is busy working on other things,Software Development Engineer,Current Employee,nan,Aug 9 2022

nan,5,Straightforward Interview Process and Training,The interview process was exactly what I was told it would be and all the interviewers were very pleasant I definitely had to spend a good amount of time reviewing both the Leadership Principles connecting them to behavioral answers as well as typical technical questions and system design case interviews However in my prior position I was at much more of a business level in tech consulting rather than deep into the weeds in any specific area Just make sure to be very quantitative in your interviews As for training as an SA the process is super well structured for the first 3 months its a bit rigorous but it gives you a strong feeling for what it will feel like to be an Account SA In addition you are required to obtain multiple AWS certifications in the first 18 months which prepares you very well for the role alongside working directly with the services with clients Lastly you have the option to join a sort of concentration in one or two of multiple areas eg AIML so you can choose to dive a bit deeper into that area to learn more and make a wider impact Lateral movement as well as continuous improvement learning are super common and so there are many many opportunities for career growth So far work life balance seems pretty solid However I just joined 3 months ago so take this with a grain of salt,Benefits are not as good as they should be for such a massive company although the salary outweighs this which is probably partially due to the frugality leadership principle Also while I get the cultlike atmosphere is in reality very effective for maintaining cohesion and friendly work cultures within such a massive company I wouldnt change it the use of puns is out of control,Solutions Architect,Current Employee,Boston MA,Nov 23 2022

nan,5,Flexible Work Environment Manage Your Own Career,I really enjoy the lack of micromanagement at Amazon and the philosophy of speaking up for your ideas even above your management if you truly feel your idea has merit Compensation is very competitive in my experience and youre expected to chart your career trajectory with your manager and theyre expected to guide you to new opportunities even if it means you leave their team,There are only a few downsides I can think of and they feel nitpicky to me 1 Accruing PTO and vacation time as a salaried employee Its a little annoying especially if you live in a state where youre only paid once a month 2 Compensation increases are sometimes tied up in stock which about two years to vest 3 Constant change in the form or reorgs This could just be my corner of Amazon but its hard to understand who does whatespecially as a new hirewhen people and teams constantly get moved around The reasons are always good it just tends to make my head spin a little,Graphic Designer,Current Employee,Las Vegas NV,Jul 21 2022

nan,4,For BUF 5 associate,A surprisingly good place to work The pay is alright but should be more given fast food in NY is 15hour Base pay in NY is 1525 to be competitive I love the time off and how quickly you accrue UPT The short work break program is really nice,Base pay in NY 1525 go to fast food and you might make more Pretty repetitive eventually you burn out From what I read for parental leave options theyre definitely not great for a company as rich as amazon paid tuition means around 2k a year so nothing You also dont get free or discounted prime considering you do the work for the item and prime is 160 a year this sucks You do get a 10 discount but only on things shipped and sold by Amazon,Associate,Current Employee,Lancaster NY,Jun 22 2022

nan,1,Terrible Experience,Can work at any time of day,Monotonous work No human to human interaction Managed by a device have to meet strict quotas,Seasonal Warehouse Associate,Former Employee,Langhorne PA,Feb 20 2023
nan,1,Bottom Line over People,The best part of my experience was the people I worked with The most diverse group of individuals I have ever encountered who taught me so much kept a smile on my face and genuinely became my sole motivation for work You will meet the best people here unfortunately the high ups dont interact with the associates who actually run Amazon and their needs are subsided,Overtime During Peak last year I was working 65 hour work weeks with no overtime and no night differential We were expected to put in 3x the work during the holiday season without any real benefit As a manager you dont get the perks that hourly employees get like two breaks overtime holiday pay and any other benefits throughout the year Management is separate from associates and has unbelievably high expectations for compensation that is lets say not reflective of the work It is no wonder the turnover is so high The first 6 months of my job I didnt take a lunch break because it was frowned upon to ever be off the floor The second part of my tenure I made sure I took a 30 minute break every night to eat and escape the craziness but they told me that I shouldnt leave the building Policing I cant even describe how much of my time was wasted policing associates I felt like a high school principal trying to get students in trouble If you didnt give out enough written warnings every night you had to go out of your way to look for people doing something wrong So instead of helping my associates with problems they faced day to day or working to achieve long term goals with them or dedicating any time to fix the endless mechanical and technical problems faced on the daily I had to spend my time going around my department trying to catch someone on their phone or off task or not doing their job in some other way I used to have to go through everyones time cards from the day before find the people off task the most and spend my time reprimanding the few strays who werent doing their job effectively ignoring the needs of all the associates who show up and do the right thing everyday It was ridiculous and what made me lose my connections with the people and therefore my work Turnover You could never get comfortable As soon as you had a routine there were new associates or new managers or new ways to do the process or new rules or new write ups you had to give It is a constantly revolving door that goes around and around without making any real progress People were fired every day and new people came in practically every week No adjustment period no getting comfortable just work and work and work and pick up the pieces along the way Do your best theyd say But I need to see more results I was constantly putting out fires on a sinking ship Management I was at Amazon for a little over a year and I saw a multitude of leadership transitions Its very cutthroat and I lost too many good leaders who moved to other jobs after not getting their welldeserved promotion On the contrary I had too many managers who were insufficient at their jobs and stayed in leadership positions simply because they were willing to be miserable for a paycheck They cared about themselves their careers their opportunities and ABOVE ALL how YOU made them look to THEIR bosses I would be on the floor making real time quick decisions based on what I thought was best for the associates and operation and I would be reprimanded because some higher up across the country looking at a screen of data didnt like that decision didnt think it was worth it didnt see the positive result in the performance data I constantly had to compete safety with performance instead of wholly prioritizing safety and putting performance on the back burner until the situation is resolved Amazon is a giant company and unfortunately to a giant company its all a numbers game I used to defend Amazon I wanted to be the difference I wanted to change the narrative boy was I naive I quickly learned that I was caring for my people way more than any manager was caring for me And that being a good leader didnt get you recognized or praised being a good manager did A good manager does the reports on time and listens to their boss and does what is best for the company A good leader looks out for their people and creates a team environment in which we can all thrive I created a beautiful synergy in my first department on my own I was a great leader and the associates would tell you they loved me In my second department I wasnt given the time or freedom to create meaningful relationships and was forced to go into strictly manager mode Listen to your boss and do what youre told even if you dont think its the right thing to do for the people Working with people especially the number of people I was working with 100 requires a certain level of nuance I was working with all different ages ethnicities backgrounds and financial situations and as easy as it would be to throw a blanket over everyone and treat them the same theres no equity in that Maybe it just wasnt the job for me but I used to love it As soon as I was forced to set my morals aside for the betterment of the company I knew I was out,Area Manager II,Former Employee,Baltimore MD,Jan 5 2023

nan,4,Sense of Belonging,One of the great things Ive noticed since starting at Amazon is their culture of belonging Because their hiring process is so involved they already trust you to do the work when you come into the job There isnt a sense of having to prove yourself because youre new its already there because youve gone through the process,Because theyre always expecting you to raise the bar there is pressure to perform and have that bias for action,Product Manager,Current Employee,Los Angeles CA,Jul 14 2022

nan,3,Great if youre lucky brutal if not,If youre a high performer and on a team with a good culture this is a great place to be Managers are encouraged to develop your career and promote on criteria that aim to be as objective as possible The people who work here are super sharp and there are hard problems to solve Youll learn a lot here and have a huge impact The pay is great but highly dependent on stock My managers have generally been supportive of me expensing technical books to help grow my skills I also got to go to an expensive tech conference one time,If you get unlucky you might wind up on a team where the norm is to overwork and youll feel obligated to do the same Some projects are cared about more by leadership and then extreme pressure cascades down to meet deadlines Sometimes youll wind up doing more politics and negotiating than coding like if you work on something that impacts or requires help from other teams Leadership is increasingly non technical Upper leadership is starting to seem more like most popular kid in high school instead of smartest kid in high school And there are some complete total jerks in leadership Everyone in leadership there is brilliant and some are kind but some are really rulebyterror style This made me feel that I would never have what it takes to be in that level of leadership at Amazon I wish the company offered more time off Kindness empathy and collaboration are undervalued here They are glaringly absent from the leadership principles even after the recent new additions As a result people coming in who are abrasive and hostile dont learn any better so long as theyre delivering results Some of the people who Ive seen promoted to L6 which is supposed to be a leadership and role model position are such complete jerks that I feel something very important is missing from promotion guidelines Sometimes the tech work is really unglamorous like a version upgrade that would be simple at a smaller company but is a year of bureaucracy and slogging through slow builds at Amazon or having to use very outdated programming languages or using weird internal frameworks rather than something industry standard,Sr Software Engineer,Former Employee,Seattle WA,Sep 4 2022

nan,4,Simple job but hard work,The job itself is very easy though can be physical depending on what youre doing You may be lifting packages that are up to 50 lbs and they can be awkward to carry as well though you can slide them on the floor or ask for a team lift if you need help There are different sections of the warehouse that have you do different things so you arent always doing the same thing ideally You might be scanning and palletizing or you might be unloading a truck or sorting packages to go to a certain lane I liked using pallet jacks to move pallets around because it takes very little effort compared to lifting boxes and moving them,You definitely feel like a number They keep track of you by scanning your badge which feels very impersonal though most managerssupervisors do learn your name or get to know you a bit Upwards mobility offers very few perks and is limited,Warehouse Associate I,Current Employee,Brooklyn Park MN,Feb 16 2022

nan,2,FlexPT Packer it was mid,The job was simple I was a packer and because I was parttime and flex schedule I only had to make up a minimum of 4 hours a week which was easy I never got trained or asked to do another function because I was rarely there so days I did work were chill and easy I had the option of doing full shifts 8 hours or 10 at some or half shifts 3 hours and 30 mins or 4 hours and 30 mins and in some 5 hrs I generally did about 1220 hours every week and it came with 401k benefits PTO and an 8 point attendance system They also offer premiums of 25 dollars on some shifts which is a good way a making lots of money but with shorter shifts,They only offer good flexible hours during peak outside of that season you only get hours of shifts that you typically pick so if you generally do nights they’ll only start offering night shifts but if you wanted to switch to mornings which being flex you should have the ability to do so you won’t be able too because they do not give you the option too It’s vice versa for days They also try to make you vto on days you do come in even though you are already doing the least amount of hours possible if you don’t they illegally try to force you to do another function You have to take care of your of your attendance for carefully because they try to give you a point for everything even if it is not a violation and when you try to get it fixed HR takes forever and sometimes does not even understand or refuses to read cases They will close your case without fixing anything then you have to go back and open it again and basically keep doing that until they fix your issue And they are suppose to update you if you hit 8 points which qualifies you for termination but they do not always do that I was fired because I was not warned that I had 8 points and because they did not even give me a week to deal with it it boot me out of A to Z and making a case was the hardest thing ever If you are there a lot management will take advantage of you and try to harass you in the most subtle ways possible they really try to condescend you A MAJORITY OF HR PEOPLE DO NOT KNOW AMAZON POLICY OR STATE LABOR LAWS and will break them consistently Break times are really short and managers will make petty comments if you take to long to get back even though TOT is not an issue in the state of California,AAAmazon Associate,Former Employee,nan,Sep 4 2022

nan,5,IT Support Associate II Amazon,Learning on the job from day one you come in expecting to be working on printers and monitors and immediately you are welcomed by the IT team At my site we have two really good engineers that immediately gave me a tour of the building and broke down the job functions then two days later on day 3 they asked me to accompany them on a server launch On day 3 at amazon I was able to see the amazon way of deploying servers and this made me confirm that I made the right choice by leaving my cushy IT job at the school and make a change to a place where i will be challenged daily and learn something new everyday The pay is also awesome,I personally am not fond of rotating schedules as an IT support tech II you are expected to work rotating shifts that go from 7am 530pm or 5pm 430am 4 days a week These shifts rotate on a front end or back end day Sunday Wed or Wed Sunday So far that is the only downfall to this career,IT Support Associate II,Current Employee,San Antonio TX,Oct 28 2021

nan,2,4 years of amazon experience,The benefits package is really good,You do not matter You are 100 replaceable How well you do your job will not help you advance as an associate favoritism is rampant The management does not know what they are doing as most are hired right out of college and a trained by managers with about 3 weeks experience with the company the associate who have 2 years of experience are used to maintain numbers and most the work load is in turned dumped onto them L1’s are expected to pickstowpack at a faster rate then the ones with less experience but the new associates are not expected to ever reach the same rate Process assistants regularly do the jobs of area managers as the AM’s regularly dump most of their work onto PA’s so they can continue gossiping with each other in conference rooms while claiming to be discussing business metrics however never discussing anything remotely related to work for hours on end HR is not there to help you when you need help they are there to make sure management level personnel doesn’t get the company sued so you will be let go without hesitation if there is a issue with management The only way you will move up in this company is by kissing butt your performance has as much influence as your ability to walk,Warehouse Worker,Former Employee,Ruskin FL,Dec 20 2021

nan,5,Thoughts After Three Months,Amazon as a whole is incredibly customerobsessed unlike anything Ive ever experienced before Even during my onboarding process Ive been encouraged numerous times to work backwards and think about what the customer needs and how they would benefit from this Their virtual onboarding process is topnotch and Ive had zero issues getting ramped up remotely Their leadership principles are something that seemingly everyone I talk to has memorized and embodies in their daytoday activities So far Ive been really impressed,In my role Amazon has a formal onboarding process that can take up to 34 months to complete This isnt simply a checkbox after you watch some training videos rather they want to ensure that you can innovate and build on behalf of their customers My onboarding experience has been great but you do feel a bit isolated from the team while youre going through this,Senior Solutions Architect,Current Employee,Saint Louis MO,Feb 11 2022

nan,5,want to do disruptive projects and don’t fear stepping out of comfort zone this place is for you,1learning the learning I received in 2 month at Amazon was more than I received in any of my previous jobs in a period of 2 years 2 innovation if you are a person who can’t deal with ambiguity then this job may get difficult If you do well in ambiguity then you will have 1000 ideas from the 1st week itself to make things better here The fast environment and your smart colleagues will create a very conducive environment for that 3 my team and manager very much believe in work life balance This was one of my greatest fear while joining Amazon from hearing to people’s experience But thankfully my team has a good work life balance It is very important to ask work hours on call support needed etc during interview final or after you receive offer to eliminate any surprises shocks Amazon hiring managers are very transparent about the team’s working hours needs,1 I was leading projects programs within 1 month joining Amazon although my manager did not give any deliverable but the competitive environment and fast moving projects make you perform best cons of it is you yourself take unnecessary pressure for the fear of missing out or to prove your skill So it is important to know how and when to draw the line else there is high chance of burn out Remind yourself this everyday 2 things move very fast and you need to be always ready to take fast actions Sometimes you will do very well and sometimes you will fail to take best decisions If you are a person who gets bogged down by mistakes or critical feedback this place can become stressful,Senior Program Manager,Current Employee,nan,May 31 2022

nan,4,Very Straightforward Easy Job Overall,Amazon incorporates a flexup flexdown system This means that if theres not enough work to be done everyone is allowed to leave up to an hour early or even eariler occasonially If theres a lot of work to be done everyone has to stay an extra hour but worry not you get paid for that extra hour Near the end of a shift they will also provide the option for you to leave early if the workload decreases enough to justify doing so This option is on a first come firstserved basis so keep an ear out for the opprotunity if you want to leave early However know that you get paid less for leaving early After about three months of working in an Amazon Sort Center you get to modify your shift to your liking if there are empty shifts availible The break times are sufficient and the vending machines have decent food chocolates candy sweet savory,In order to keep track of the diligent workers from the slackers Amazon tracks the scanners of the appropiate workers They record how many boxes you scanned per minute This means that if you scan at a fast rate then are later directed by a leader to load the trailers the rate will go down The following week or so you will be questioned on why your rate is low then youll have to tell the inquiring leader that another leader told you to do another task Supposedly the person directing you to the other task is supposed to scan your bagde when you switch so that management knows this However this never happens in reality Instead you are rushed to your new task leading to multiple unncessary interrogations Another con lack of consistancy When I first started working at the job only people who where crossdocked trained could load the trailers Then all of a sudden everyone could Then only those trained could Also you will keep getting questions on whether you are trained for a certain position The trainings you receive arent officially recorded in Amazons employee database nor are you giving an indication eg sticker to verify that you are trained in a particular skill,Warehouse Associate,Former Employee,nan,Jul 5 2022

nan,4,Not terrible but not ideal either,Voluntary Time Off and Paid Time Off Benefits are super flexible my requests were always accepted when I qualified for them Unpaid Time Off means you have flexibility regarding being late my commute was a little on the long side so I was occasionally late 3day weekends Pick your schedule on the application site 10hour 4day shifts if you want to work full time You dont need to do much to get a job at Amazon just apply do a drug test and all the basic stuff Not much was required regarding interviewing either Seriously theyll hire practically anyone so dont worry about hiring discrimination or tons of interviews and qualifications Pay and benefits are decent Medical dental vision 401K and all that good stuff were included I think there are additional benefits and you can earn more Paid Time Off and Vacation Time the longer you work there the PTO adds up the more you work This job actually helped me make enough to move out of my parents house I live in Indiana though so keep in mind your financial situation may vary depending on the state you live in Managers people working there were pretty nice overall Good opportunities for promotion I was promoted to a problem solver within 6 months Theyre somewhat understanding if you have a disability of some kind as long as it doesnt overly interfere with your work just ask for an accommodation My Brother in Christ this is a factory job It isnt meant to be your dream job but it pays the bills and its a relatively easy job provided you can adapt to it,Constant backlog during peak season means tons of daunting mandatory 11hour shifts 4 10hour shifts plus a 30minute lunch break makes for long exhausting workdays and oddly structured weeks Also dont work nights just for the extra buck per hour if youre not built for that itll mess up your sleep schedule Theyre a little overly obsessive about making your rate of items scanned per hour depending on what part of the factory you work in which is hard to do especially when youre starting out Somewhat dangerous working conditions lots of heavy lifting in some roles I injured my back at one point while working there Dont take too long when youre taking a bathroom breaks or you might get counted for Time Off Task I have IBS so this was a problem for me for a while If youre not happy about Amazons more controversial practices and really dont like their higherups or Jeff Bezos dont work here Itll just make you more depressed about latestage capitalism and all that,Warehouse Associate,Former Employee,Greenfield IN,Sep 1 2022

nan,5,Solid place to start a career but easy to burn out Dont stay too long,• Solid place to learn best practices of quality software engineering Lots of established processes and documentation ensure only good quality code is shipped out The environment is very structured • Firsthand access to learning and mastering all aspects of AWS as Amazon uses its own product to host its own infrastructure Any training you can find here is extremely valuable and carry from job to job,• Company is frugal but in practice extremely stingy Snacks arent free theyre placed behind a vending machine you need to pay for The only napkins you get are paper towel rolls Pro from this is that I can bet that with WFH becoming more popular Amazon is probably going to use this to cut costs on their office buildings for software developers • At least for my team there was a high turnover There were 14 people on the team when I joined but 10 when I left Those 10 were not the same 14 and someone was leaving every month We had portraits of people organized in order of likeliness to leave and called that the graveyard I thought it was a joke until it wasnt But thats just my experience • Upward mobility is easy at first then it becomes exponentially harder without too much payoff People usually just promote and leave for another big company that pays more and has better perks since its not worth the overwork to get to that next level Youre going to see more people earlier in their career and the veteran Amazonian is incredibly rare • There are incentives and clear goals to make it to the next level but chances are the workload is so high that youre probably going to burn out before you get there and transfer out before you vest all your RSUs WLB is not really valued just work,Software Development Engineer I,Former Employee,Santa Monica CA,Sep 12 2022

nan,1,John Henry DSP is the worst company to ever work for,Decent benefits that start from first day of work,There is an enormous amount of cons working as an Associate for Amazon Warehouse Ill just be listing what I see as major cons 1 Once 3 month period is up managers expect 200hr on Pack 600hr on rebin and over 1000hr on induct This these are achievable only if there is a constantly flow of items and absolutely working like a horse I would say I was one of the harder working employees and the numbers are unrealistic Our managers would post the average numbers of each person after lunch I was usually in the top 5 but most people are getting about half of these numbers working at a normal pace 2 ToT Time off task is an absolutely ridiculous concept There had been a few items I was flagged for ToT and a manager had came and spoke to me about it Every time I was using the restroom The restrooms were not evenly spaced apart in my facility Just walking to the restroom you would take you 5 minutes alone Not to mention actually using the restroom and walking back Managers told me that the best time to use the restroom would be during breaks or lunch exclusively This seems like some kind of human rights in the workplace violation 3 Switching roles is near impossible This is based off which facility and area you are that but the managers in my department played favorites I wanted to switch roles and find a schedule that better suited me I started by going to HR who were completely incompetent They ask you to submit requests on the mobile app and they will be evaluated My requests were always denied Why were they denied They were denied because of ToT violations in the last month When I brought this up to my department managers they repeated that the restroom should be exclusively used during breakslunches Not only that they told me I was needed in the AFE department with me being in the top 5 average numbers consistently 4 Advancement in the company is difficult I was told moving from level 1 to level 3 internally you would have to be with the company at least a year This is understandable if it was actually true The facility I was working at was newly built and higher level positions were needed Even though I was trained in all aspects of the AFE department including Quality as well as being an Ambassador I was excluded from the advancement because I was not qualified enough A level 3 was eventually chosen and quit within 2 months of having the position The position was eventually filled again by an level 3 of a different facility He also left within 6 months The best way to advance in the company is be willing to relocate potentially to different states or to launch facilities Yet not everyone is willing or have the want to relocate to a different state 5 Equipment in the facility are not properly working or down There had been multiple times where our entire shift was sent home due to malfunctions in equipment There were several times where we were left standing around for multiple hours Yes not sitting standing around Managers at in our department were keen that you could not sit during the downtime The solutions to these malfunctions was assigning MET There was a span in for almost 11 days where I did not have a single day off due to MET Another human rights in the workplace violation I understand that some of these are based off location and which facility I was working at but problems nonetheless I believe some locations could be more optimal than others but favoritism in my facility was at large This is by no means a job you would want to keep in the long run Definitely a temporary job while looking for something better,AFE Associate,Former Employee,nan,Oct 10 2022

nan,2,OK,The job was simple I was a packer and because I was parttime and flex schedule I only had to make up a minimum of 4 hours a week which was easy I never got trained or asked to do another function because I was rarely there so days I did work were chill and easy I had the option of doing full shifts 8 hours or 10 at some or half shifts 3 hours and 30 mins or 4 hours and 30 mins and in some 5 hrs I generally did about 1220 hours every week and it came with 401k benefits PTO and an 8 point attendance system They also offer premiums of 25 dollars on some shifts which is a good way a making lots of money but with shorter shifts,They only offer good flexible hours during peak outside of that season you only get hours of shifts that you typically pick so if you generally do nights they’ll only start offering night shifts but if you wanted to switch to mornings which being flex you should have the ability to do so you won’t be able too because they do not give you the option too It’s vice versa for days They also try to make you vto on days you do come in even though you are already doing the least amount of hours possible if you don’t they illegally try to force you to do another function You have to take care of your of your attendance for carefully because they try to give you a point for everything even if it is not a violation and when you try to get it fixed HR takes forever and sometimes does not even understand or refuses to read cases They will close your case without fixing anything then you have to go back and open it again and basically keep doing that until they fix your issue And they are suppose to update you if you hit 8 points which qualifies you for termination but they do not always do that I was fired because I was not warned that I had 8 points and because they did not even give me a week to deal with it it boot me out of A to Z and making a case was the hardest thing ever If you are there a lot management will take advantage of you and try to harass you in the most subtle ways possible they really try to condescend you A MAJORITY OF HR PEOPLE DO NOT KNOW AMAZON POLICY OR STATE LABOR LAWS and will break them consistently Break times are really short and managers will make petty comments if you take to long to get back even though TOT is not an issue in the state of California,AAAmazon Associate,Former Employee,nan,Sep 4 2022

nan,5,,Amazon AWS has a very clear culture that revolves around customer obsession Everything we do stems from something a customer wants and then working backwards to provide a solution I really appreciate this as my previous employer had no culture no clear vision and lacked direction In addition Amazon has amazing selfservice tools and lots of documentation so anytime I need to do something I have all the tools available to get it done without reaching out and waiting for someone else Again compared to my previous employer who had little selfserve and a lot of high touch processes this is a welcome change of pace And finally the company seems to care about people I read a lot of negative comments and articles about Amazon and how they treat their people That may have been true at one point but I have not encountered anything negative towards employees since I startedit has been the opposite with many tools and services available to make my life bettereasier,I work for AWS and for both Amazon and AWS the biggest downside is the size I am still relatively new just over 3 months and I receive emails daily for invites to discussions and events from people and groups who I do not recognize and it is difficult to discern which communications are relevant I work virtually and so far dont really feel like part of the team I am hoping that changes with time but that is probably the biggest con In addition because Amazon AWS operates in so many different areas and are beholden to so many security and compliance obligations there is a lot of upfront and ongoing training on all the usual topics security insider trading inclusiveness and so on It gets to be a lot at times,Senior Solutions Architect,Current Employee,Indianapolis IN,Aug 24 2022

nan,1,Amazon Review,You get to drive in a new van explore neighborhoods and be outside,Amazon gave us way too many packages to deliver a day and I think a lot of that was Guled’s fault our manager in Shaffey Logistics We were extremely overworked and it was unsafe and inhumane This job was very stressful with receiving approximately 200250 packages on average to deliver every day The more packages delivered the more money our manager made so he encouraged us to overwork ourselves He was unclear what the work hours were and it was never consistent He and the dispatchers would always want us to work late The delivery app has a lot of issues that need to be worked on to improve the safety of the delivery It was also very challenging to find a bathroom to go to and if we went to find a bathroom we would fall behind and disappoint our manager So this encouraged us to not go to the bathroom Also delivering to houses with dogs that could run at you and possibly bite you increased anxiety for many of us Many of my coworkers had been bit by dogs The manager also did not call off work on days that were over 100 degrees Fahrenheit and that was risking people’s lives,Delivery Associate,Former Employee,Seattle WA,May 2 2022

nan,5,Good place,Im fully remote as a preface Started during covid so they let me work from where ever Team is a data product in AWS I have good and understanding managers Cool projects that challenge me at the right level Good hours I set them myself basically Project timeline make sense for number of resources Leaders are willing to delay deadlines due to unforeseen situations Long term goals make sense Performance reviews make sense you get feedback anonymously from peers and manager The tool available are sufficient for work Clear growth areas and paths as an engineer Everyone is very helpful and responsive I find it silly to disregard an entire massive company because of a few bad teams here and there I suggest you to get to know the teamproduct you are interviewing with and then make a judgement I hear talks of PIP all the time but that happens to like bottom 10 If you are the other 90 AKA most people its irrelevant for you,Oncall is rough at times Im on like 3 oncall rotations An extra one for me since Im US citizen and US citizens have exclusive access to certain cloud regions Lack of enough senior engineers seasoned veterans on my team Theyre already pretty rare but we can do with more to learn from None of the typical software perks No free food drinks etc You get free banana if youre in Seattle Can have WFH things reimbursed but with a budget cap backloaded RSU schedule,Software Development Engineer II,Current Employee,Boston MA,Aug 9 2022

nan,5,Interesting,Learning on the job from day one you come in expecting to be working on printers and monitors and immediately you are welcomed by the IT team At my site we have two really good engineers that immediately gave me a tour of the building and broke down the job functions then two days later on day 3 they asked me to accompany them on a server launch On day 3 at amazon I was able to see the amazon way of deploying servers and this made me confirm that I made the right choice by leaving my cushy IT job at the school and make a change to a place where i will be challenged daily and learn something new everyday The pay is also awesome,I personally am not fond of rotating schedules as an IT support tech II you are expected to work rotating shifts that go from 7am 530pm or 5pm 430am 4 days a week These shifts rotate on a front end or back end day Sunday Wed or Wed Sunday So far that is the only downfall to this career,IT Support Associate II,Current Employee,San Antonio TX,Oct 28 2021

nan,3,Great Culture and Flexibility,Amazon offers a lot of accommodations options from voluntary time of paid time off vacation personal leave of absence school accommodations family accommodations etc Since there are so many people coming and going in Amazon there isn’t personal expectations on personally developing every person at work if you just want to come to work and get paid There’s always changes and random new projects for innovation but in production sense makes little sense Amazon wants to put any person to do any job So you can always get trained in a new role to find something you like but depending on your personality and work ethics it may be challenging to juggle all at once,Since Amazon has such a high turnover rate at times getting to know everyone is a hard task And most accountability is more automated by statistics and when statistics aren’t met management will coach you Every management coaching style varies Amazon has many opportunities for growth but sometimes it’s more of who you know and how long you’ve been with amazon than what you know What you know gets the door open but who you know gets you through the door Since people from many walks of life work here from 18 and up professionalism is limited and people may be more vocal and crass at times or blatant bias can be seen,Tier III Process Assistant,Current Employee,Rialto CA,Aug 5 2022

nan,4,Great,Amazon incorporates a flexup flexdown system This means that if theres not enough work to be done everyone is allowed to leave up to an hour early or even eariler occasonially If theres a lot of work to be done everyone has to stay an extra hour but worry not you get paid for that extra hour Near the end of a shift they will also provide the option for you to leave early if the workload decreases enough to justify doing so This option is on a first come firstserved basis so keep an ear out for the opprotunity if you want to leave early However know that you get paid less for leaving early After about three months of working in an Amazon Sort Center you get to modify your shift to your liking if there are empty shifts availible The break times are sufficient and the vending machines have decent food chocolates candy sweet savory,In order to keep track of the diligent workers from the slackers Amazon tracks the scanners of the appropiate workers They record how many boxes you scanned per minute This means that if you scan at a fast rate then are later directed by a leader to load the trailers the rate will go down The following week or so you will be questioned on why your rate is low then youll have to tell the inquiring leader that another leader told you to do another task Supposedly the person directing you to the other task is supposed to scan your bagde when you switch so that management knows this However this never happens in reality Instead you are rushed to your new task leading to multiple unncessary interrogations Another con lack of consistancy When I first started working at the job only people who where crossdocked trained could load the trailers Then all of a sudden everyone could Then only those trained could Also you will keep getting questions on whether you are trained for a certain position The trainings you receive arent officially recorded in Amazons employee database nor are you giving an indication eg sticker to verify that you are trained in a particular skill,Warehouse Associate,Former Employee,nan,Jul 5 2022

nan,1,Mediocre and dangerous,Three day weekends good benefits,A few weeks ago ￼I was transferred to a site in Joliet MDW2 I was genuinely put in one of the most toxic work environments I have ever known or experienced I was warned before I came that it would be challenging but no one mentioned that It would be ridiculously toxic and that I would be hazed by an entire 40 people From my understanding I was put on the team to replace the current manager who already has a lengthy HR investigation against them So I started at this new site and I had a counterpart that was already having some HR issues ￼ From the start it was toxic I recognized several safety policies being broken by my counterpart and the team Every single time I escalated or tried to correct them I was told it was no big deal and to let it go So I kept letting it go although I was fully aware of the actual policies ￼ Things began to come to a head when ￼my counterpart demeaned me and yelled at ￼me over the radio in front of my entire team for “doing too much” ￼ Then when I escalated to higher up because of the disrespect I was not advocated for at all In fact I was told that I should take the abuse from her on the radio and then later attempt to have a facetoface conversation with my equivalent despite her lengthy record of disrespect and the fact that I’d only been there two weeks oh and also managing her is actually NOT in my job description at all Once I realized that I wasn’t safe at work that everyone hated me and that I would not be advocated for when I was mistreated I started having severe panic attacks In fact if any of you have been questioning my mental health lately you now know what I’ve been dealing with Anyways I had no choice but to take matters into my own hands So I spoke to HR myself Unfortunately my counterpart keeps eyes on me at all times by accessing the camera system at our site￼ So She was fully aware at the actions I had taken to protect myself Next she called together the entire team and actually advised them to not acknowledge me sit by me or talk to me at all￼ In fact I noticed the treatment from the team before I realized that they were actually instructed to treat me this way It even got to the point where if I answered a radio call out someone would respond “no I don’t want you” ￼Anyways a couple of The AA’s On my team actually did come forward today to admit that they were all told to treat me that way by their direct manager At this point my mental health had been slipping drastically I’ve never once had a job where I struggled so hard to just walk in I have never had a job give me such severe panic attacks￼ I was at my wits end I reached out again to my boss and the HR person because I knew that I honestly could not handle being put in environment that fostered gang mentality and influenced people to be cruel to me 40 hours a week So I reached out I begged them and pleaded with them to send me to a different site Instead of being understanding and empathetic about my mental health and the very toxic situation They put me in they were basically annoyed They really didn’t have alternatives for me and they were so rude to me while I was desperately begging for help in their office￼￼￼￼ Despite working at Amazon for years being a manager and not having any issues like this at prior sites Amazon did not advocate for me ￼￼,Transportation Area Manager,Current Employee,Joliet IL,Sep 9 2022

nan,5,Even better than expected,AWS is truly a culture of innovation highvelocity decision making where everyone is a builder and a leader even if they arent managers AWS imbues the 16 Amazon Leadership Principles in everything from strategic decision making to every day meetings and interactions The mechanisms and processes that enable bottom up invention on behalf of customers isnt just hype it is real The bar raising LOOP interview process is not just some right of passage but rather the first introduction to what life is like inside Amazon and what is expected of you If you read the Leadership Principles or watch YouTube videos of them and think wow I want to be part of that then AWS is for you on the other hand if you tilt your head and think I dont know about all of that culture stuff then AWS isnt for you dont fake it Amazon is a longterm company particularly with hiring and retention Once inside Amazon it is very likely you can pursue your career goals even at a completely different part of the company for example going from an Amazon warehouse worker to a Software Developer yep seriously,AWS is demanding as it should be to belong to a company that strives to be earths best employer and truly obsesses over customers AWS is a very selfhelp culture which can be overwhelming to many who prefer having a lot of guidance and structure to learn their job and daily duties instead AWS demands a lot of invention and deep understanding of problems plus initiative to find the right solutions AWS can be a little inefficient at times but it serves a purpose as it empowers action and invention on behalf of customer obsession even if multiple teams are trying to solve the samesimilar problems It appears to those new to Amazon that these inefficiencies are bad for the company but they are intentional until over the longer term one version of a solution is the best the multiple threads can benefit our customers and sharpen our innovative solutions,Senior Program Manager,Current Employee,Arlington VA,Jun 26 2022

nan,1,Amazon does not care for its employees and fosters a toxic work environment,Three day weekends good benefits,A few weeks ago ￼I was transferred to a site in Joliet MDW2 I was genuinely put in one of the most toxic work environments I have ever known or experienced I was warned before I came that it would be challenging but no one mentioned that It would be ridiculously toxic and that I would be hazed by an entire 40 people From my understanding I was put on the team to replace the current manager who already has a lengthy HR investigation against them So I started at this new site and I had a counterpart that was already having some HR issues ￼ From the start it was toxic I recognized several safety policies being broken by my counterpart and the team Every single time I escalated or tried to correct them I was told it was no big deal and to let it go So I kept letting it go although I was fully aware of the actual policies ￼ Things began to come to a head when ￼my counterpart demeaned me and yelled at ￼me over the radio in front of my entire team for “doing too much” ￼ Then when I escalated to higher up because of the disrespect I was not advocated for at all In fact I was told that I should take the abuse from her on the radio and then later attempt to have a facetoface conversation with my equivalent despite her lengthy record of disrespect and the fact that I’d only been there two weeks oh and also managing her is actually NOT in my job description at all Once I realized that I wasn’t safe at work that everyone hated me and that I would not be advocated for when I was mistreated I started having severe panic attacks In fact if any of you have been questioning my mental health lately you now know what I’ve been dealing with Anyways I had no choice but to take matters into my own hands So I spoke to HR myself Unfortunately my counterpart keeps eyes on me at all times by accessing the camera system at our site￼ So She was fully aware at the actions I had taken to protect myself Next she called together the entire team and actually advised them to not acknowledge me sit by me or talk to me at all￼ In fact I noticed the treatment from the team before I realized that they were actually instructed to treat me this way It even got to the point where if I answered a radio call out someone would respond “no I don’t want you” ￼Anyways a couple of The AA’s On my team actually did come forward today to admit that they were all told to treat me that way by their direct manager At this point my mental health had been slipping drastically I’ve never once had a job where I struggled so hard to just walk in I have never had a job give me such severe panic attacks￼ I was at my wits end I reached out again to my boss and the HR person because I knew that I honestly could not handle being put in environment that fostered gang mentality and influenced people to be cruel to me 40 hours a week So I reached out I begged them and pleaded with them to send me to a different site Instead of being understanding and empathetic about my mental health and the very toxic situation They put me in they were basically annoyed They really didn’t have alternatives for me and they were so rude to me while I was desperately begging for help in their office￼￼￼￼ Despite working at Amazon for years being a manager and not having any issues like this at prior sites Amazon did not advocate for me ￼￼,Transportation Area Manager,Current Employee,Joliet IL,Sep 9 2022

nan,1,Its okay if youre cool with being worked like a dog,Pay is not bad And you get paid more on holidays Lots of over time during busy times Like back to school Christmas summer etc You also still get paid if they have to shut the warehouse for any reason Like weather etc When its not busy you sometimes can choose to go home early no they wont pay you if you choose to go home Career choice program Im getting my CDL and do not have to pay for classes Paid Time Off Lots of leave options Paid leave for certain circumstances,Limited Time off If you get sick or something and youve already used the time off they gave you you cant take any more time off Sometimes theyll cut you a break but its a coin flip They are watching over your progress every second If you deviate from your task for over 5 minutes the system alerts them So you are to be working on your feet nonstop for up to 2 hours and 45 minutes at a time They say they dont limit bathroom time but if you take too much time in the bathroom theyll repeatedly write you up And if you get more than three wrote ups you could get fired A lot of the time the managers dont consult you before giving you a write up And sometimes they wont you they gave you one You wont know unless you ask A lot of the managers are rather nice But one manager who happened to be my manager is not After telling her that I had been moving slow because I was walking for hours my boots were heavy and my feet hurt really bad she responded “well everyone else can do it” they tell you when theyre hiring you that you get two 15minute breaks and a 30minute break but when you start working they tell you that those 15 minute breaks are “scan to scan” that means after the last time you scanned an item you have 15 minutes to scan another item It can take about 5 minutes to walk to the nearest break room because the facility is so big So you sometimes only get 5 minutes or less to sit down which feels like nothing when youve been walking for 2 hours and 45 minutes you dont get to choose your job They put you where they need you as soon as youre hired And you cant get a new position for at least 30 days And even then they may not let you switch In my case I tried multiple times to switch to a position I thought I could perform better in and was denied I was constantly written up because my productivity didnt meet their demands I could go on but Ill stop here,Warehouse Picker,Current Employee,Middletown DE,Sep 8 2022

nan,4,Heres the Truth,Number 1 Pro is your stock options that is if you can stay with the company the required time to allow stock to vest Overall good working environment based on the building section and leadership in place There is always an opportunity to cross train and move to a different job The health benefits are phenomenal and they company will pay for school for advancement Employees even have the opportunity to have a personalized shift to accommodate classes,From day 1 everyone talks to you with these acronyms as if you are expected to understand what all that jargon means A lot of information is thrown at you in week which may have nothing to do with your direct job Depending on your building and turn over you may be training yourself on the new job The hours are brutal with shifts ranging from various days and times Amazon does not really allow sitting onsite 10 Hours on your feet is devastating to the body be sure that you want to put your body through this if you have medical or disability items The time off is minimal I have never worked so many hours for so little vacation and PTO You are also given 10 hours of unpaid time that can only be used in 1 hour increments,Whs Specialist,Current Employee,nan,May 11 2022

nan,4,Large and Complex,The opportunity to learn and grow is top notch Amazon is leading the way in many technologies and there is most likely an area to work on that you can feel passionate about This could be a particular technology stack you want to work in or a particular market sector you want to work in,Amazon is large and it is easy to got lost in the ocean without a mentor or someone you can talk with While Amazon is fast paced I felt like I moved at a snails pace to get onboarded and to get to some real work I do have 0 years of experience though so Almost all experiences will be different based on the team you are on,Software Dev Engineer,Current Employee,nan,May 4 2022
nan,4,Different Organizations Different ProsCons,Unmatched benefits Ive seriously never had benefits like this before Extremely affordable start Day1 Fairish pay If youre coming into Amazon in a more professional role you typically will be paid more if youre an external hire vs an internal hiretransfer Growth Upward Mobility Being such a large company there are venues and areas to grow into that wouldnt be possible at other corporations If youre at Amazon for 2 years you can apply transfer to any role in the company regardless of collegiate degree requirements I think thats pretty cool,Fairish pay If youre coming into Amazon in a more professional role you typically will be paid more if youre an external hire vs an internal hiretransfer I put this on both the proscons because its frustrating when you work really hard to get promoted and then an external hire comes in probably making more than you with less Amazon experience Rollouts Updates Amazon rolls out new procedures when it seems like theyre only about 50 ready and leaves the heavy lifting to the folks on the ground to figure out the rest of the work,Recruitment Marketing Coordinator,Current Employee,nan,Oct 13 2021

nan,3,More or less what you expect,I like the benefit time system Pto vto and unpaid time makes it very flexible for an employee to handle life and events as they come up,Low almost exploitative wages in my opinion They want you to take on 34 role responsibilities before even having a chance at a any real pay increase The company is so reliant on the app and what their computer system says doesnt seem to really care about their employees lives or reasons behind any possible issues I wish their benefit package was better,Warehouse Fullfilment Associate,Current Employee,nan,Apr 4 2022

nan,4,New Hire ApplicationInterviewFirst Months,Job interview was straight forward and smooth process Interview questions were straight forward and simple enough in scope Very accommodating workload Small tasks and less work expected at start and the team works with my school schedule as I finish my classes Ample time off and work life balance with little micromanagement and never working more than 40 hours per week Compensation came in much higher than I asked for or expected Free reign on tools to implement solutions Management is knowledgeable on tech Problems and work is engaging interesting and has high impact,Lots of proprietary and legacy code and frameworks to learn Help networks for code and questions not always as strong as I would like Compensation appears to stall Original offer is for a four year plan and each years performance wont affect comp until 4 years later No yearly bonus and retirement and health are mediocre But comp is high enough that is not much of a bother Promotions appear difficult to obtain and no clear growth to move through Seems it relies on large jumps II III once every 5 years or so Instead of lots of micro movements But again comp is much higher than comparative offers that this is not much of a bother,Software Development Engineer SDE II,Current Employee,Seattle WA,Dec 2 2021
nan,3,Meat Grinder,Amazing opportunity to work with other hardworking and intelligent peers The work is complex and challenging with a steep learning curve and once you pass it its pretty easy Unless you want to contribute to making it challenging for the next person by adding to the complexity,Rumors of it being a meat grinder are understated Its an aggressive culture with toxicity promoted by mid level managers sr finance and director level who use it to suppress talent There are obvious exceptions so when landing a job dont be afraid to be diligent with the hiring manager Get as good a sense of their style personality and willingness to be supportive and not just toss you to the side after Day 1 with the time honored you own it mindset even though its your second day on the job and you had nothing to do with how it was being done or what the prior person had done to it before you started Its horrible environment where you dont get grace and even when your manager might have been the one in the role youre filling now they can easily reprimand you for the poor job youre they had been doing,Finance Manager,Former Employee,Seattle WA,Dec 2 2021
nan,3,Real mixed bag when it comes to managers,Compensation is above average Most teams are still remote after covid,I have been on the same team for close to 3 years I stayed because of how much I liked and respected my manager and skip level manager I’m the last 6 months they have both left and my new manager is far far worse All of my friends and coworkers who have left have said something similar about their teams If you’re lucky enough to get a good teammanager then it’s a great place to be Otherwise it’s horrible,Product Manager,Current Employee,Santa Barbara CA,Jun 1 2022
nan,3,Not a bad job but shouldn’t be a forever job,Decent benefits decent pay You only work 4 days in a row 10 hour shifts and lots of overtime opportunities You can also wear whatever you want in the building easy job no interview process you just get hired on the spot,It can get very hot in the building in the summer Because the work hours are 10 and a half hours a day it can be very physically exhausting The work is very repetitive and you can’t listen to music I’ve been here for 3 years so I’m sick of the work but that’s just me personally,Packer,Current Employee,Robinsville NJ,Jun 1 2022

nan,5,This will be a bit of a different take on the hiring process,Demographic Info 50 Male with 20 years of tech experience Ive been at Amazon for less than 6 months The Next Steps were always clearly described From my first contact with a Recruiter to being made an offer I always knew where I was in the process Obviously there were times where I didnt know if I passed an interview or not but I did know when I would be contacted with a specified number of days Amazon went out of their way to make sure I and other candidates were well educated on the company culture and hiring process From my first contact with a Recruiter I was provided information on the LPs you gotta know the LPs and other detailed information I participated with about 100 other candidates where I was given specific clarifications and instructions about the position and the specific LPs that interviewers were looking for They are practically giving you the answers They set interviewees up for success This was unlike anything I had experienced Even during very technical demanding interviews I never felt like the interviewers were laying traps or coming up with gotchas If I made a statement or explanation about some topic the interviewers would frequently dig for more details Hint Thats an LP I felt the interviewers had a vested interest in asking difficult but good questions during the interview process and making sure I was a good fit I have seen many requests from potential candidates on getting the answers to the questionsscenarios While I understand that mentality and did a serious amount of research on the type of questions asked if youre just looking for the right answers youre missing a HUGE part of the process The technical ability is one thing but the CULTURE is often overlooked Do you really want to work at a company where you dont gel with the corporate culture I sure didnt I spoke with enough people and asked enough questions to get an excellent feel for the culture and the type of people with whom I would be working Its not a monoculture Prior to interviewing I was expecting a Yes Man type of culture Its not like that at all Its actually very refreshing to hear disagreements about process functionality etc and its all based on whats right for the product team and ultimately the customer Its not a my turf type of thing which I found exasperating at other companies LPs When I first heard about them Ill admit I rolled my eyes and thought this was just another take on the infamous Corporate Mission Statement I was very pleased that a bunch of these really resonated with my personal belief system Another way to look at them is that even if you think the LPs are not effective meaningful or whatever they provide a lens that allows you to know how people think about work products features colleagues customers etc I personally like most of them,I wish the hiring process would have been faster but the sheer number of candidates that they have to interview is staggering Amazon does a good job of weeding out people who do not have a good sense of analysis and nontechnical people at least for my role,Senior Technical Account Manager,Current Employee,Nashville TN,Apr 7 2022

nan,3,KCVG New Air Hub,Colleagues Benefits and work life balance,I thought Amazon was a World Class Company but coming from 21 years at ProcterGamble I was really disappointed in they way the business was led and operated by such unqualified managers They are so insecure that they refuse to recognize or appreciate technical mastery They seemed paranoid and delusional more concerned with building clicks and a bubble of trust versus aligning the right people with the right positions They totally ignore capabilities and contributions of great individuals It’s a real pity to experience such nonsense in what I had envisioned as a “World Class Company” We had the dream team in controls we had an incredible startup and launch at KCVG thanks to the star power of our team Sadly I had to watched my team members quit one after another until I had no choice but to also quit because they were not being replaced and it was no longer sustainable The regional and senior maintenance managers lack technical mastery they are under qualified to hold such positions This alone has a huge impact on the whole operation and moral of the technical community We were often abused because we were unable to communicate reliably with upper level management who are out of touch because they literally don’t have the expertise or experience to comprehend what is being said or what needs to happen to make a difference The business and the workforce suffers from such poor judgment decision making Amazon is an immature operation that is struggling to grow up They have this idiotic misconception that employees who have the option to sit will not perform well They truly believe that an employee who is in physical pain will perform better than one that has the ability to sit relieve the pain of standing in one spot for hours This is how absurd they’re thinking absolutely no people skills They actually believe an employee won’t get out of their chair when the job requires it not true They should take the chairs away from administrative workers let them stand all day and see if their performance improves,Controls Technician,Former Employee,nan,Jul 29 2022

nan,5,want to do disruptive projects and don’t fear stepping out of comfort zone this place is for you,1learning the learning I received in 2 month at Amazon was more than I received in any of my previous jobs in a period of 2 years 2 innovation if you are a person who can’t deal with ambiguity then this job may get difficult If you do well in ambiguity then you will have 1000 ideas from the 1st week itself to make things better here The fast environment and your smart colleagues will create a very conducive environment for that 3 my team and manager very much believe in work life balance This was one of my greatest fear while joining Amazon from hearing to people’s experience But thankfully my team has a good work life balance It is very important to ask work hours on call support needed etc during interview final or after you receive offer to eliminate any surprises shocks Amazon hiring managers are very transparent about the team’s working hours needs,1 I was leading projects programs within 1 month joining Amazon although my manager did not give any deliverable but the competitive environment and fast moving projects make you perform best cons of it is you yourself take unnecessary pressure for the fear of missing out or to prove your skill So it is important to know how and when to draw the line else there is high chance of burn out Remind yourself this everyday 2 things move very fast and you need to be always ready to take fast actions Sometimes you will do very well and sometimes you will fail to take best decisions If you are a person who gets bogged down by mistakes or critical feedback this place can become stressful,Senior Program Manager,Current Employee,nan,May 31 2022

nan,2,Robots Wanted,Immediate Benefits Good Benefits Self Managed LOL,Between the poor training and lack of inclusion you well feel alone and incompetent from day one Very few managers even try to manage people but with no idea how Most employees cant name their supervisor They force you to use an app Amazon AZ for anything HR but it offers a terrible user interface difficult to understand with NO training and calling ERC its like calling your bank where they just keep pushing you to a website as you sit on indefinite hold And never expect a follow up call Between the App and HR they constantly make errors with your VTO UPT and PTO They over market the culture inclusion Green Initiative and Customer Centric message In practice they do just the opposite They are supposedly Lean Six Sigma Certified but the rate of defect is ridiculous so bad it wouldnt even qualify The work stations and equipment are disorganized outdated in disrepair and disorganized as employees reorganize as they see fit MAny are held together with the same packaging tape that are used on boxes Some employees sleep on the work stations watch TV on their IPhones and if youre walking through the parking lot will get you a contact high Turnover is a constant wave of unmeasurable numbers They train inbound and outbound to look for colored lights to identify products set for shipping but 30 dont work But not too worry you are still accountable to the numbers And the waste levels for consumables boxes dunnage bubble packing etc is close to 20 The management is unmotivated lazy disinterested lack people skills inexperienced in distribution untrained in managing people and their favorite quote regarding for problems It doesnt matter Amazon doesnt care because they can afford it Im sure they can but the costs get passed down to their Customer Centric customers I took a job their at night due to a divorce and not sleeping anyway I wanted to see what kind of company it was to see if it might be a good fit for an Executive Career change I was tasked with doing a Process Analysis following Lean Six Sigma guidelines uncompensated and on my own time I constantly battled the Amazon AZ app and HR regarding my hours You know coming in late due to my ProBono work I was getting a little fed up so I decided to follow their leadership mission statement I was direct in my criticism of the aforementioned I needed certain information to complete my Lean Six project and the upper management were dragging their feet I suppose Maybe the King in his new clothes didnt want to people to know he was naked So after being told by my supervisor dont worry about being late I was notified of termination Thats right the form COO killing time due to insomnia and working on a project that could have been billed in excess of 50000 if done by an outside firm got let go I decided to go through the hearing with The Head of Operations Manny and two HR people I was told to gather evidence but as I was collecting the infamous AZ locked me out The first meeting they never sent me a link for the Amazon Chime virtual meeting not surprising no one in HR is really sure of anything So funny thing on the call the HR staff didnt say a word not even their names And Manny was almost as quiet I think he went to sleep I owned the fact that I was often late I have two day jobs one as a consultant and the other Freebie for Besos Its no wonder he stepped down hes likely running away Anyway I was very direct on all subjects even referring to my report my case study as a blood bath and embarrassment I stuck to that leadership credo And why shouldnt I They couldnt get the meeting right they were rude or arrogant at best Inclusive I was a one man show with no audience and the meeting they actually remembered to send a link for was just an exercise in eye rolls So the process is suppose to take about two weeks before I get an answer I was informed in less than 15 minutes by a form letter and an anonymous noreply email Im sure they had their fragile egos threatened and had long before that made the decision to neutralize the threat This is the problem often with large companies the middle and next tier managers start believing they are as big as the company and their egos follow They forget humility teamwork inclusion and who is actually doing the work I guarantee you Manny is the guy that takes credit but he isnt smart enough to realize his biggest claim to fame is wasting millions of dollars while he is watching funny animal videos on his smart phone By the way the reason I was tasked with the Lean Six project Because I was complaining I identified a problems that was as obvious as the Amazon logo I cannot tolerate waste of resources especially human I cannot tolerate companies that throw around words like culture inclusion yet have no idea how to create manage or spread it organically Likewise Green and Customer Centric Wasting mountains of new boxes bubble package which is a petroleum processed consumable human resources and at such a rate is embarrassing Next time you get a way too large box for something very small and packed with a half a roll of plastic bubbles dont be surprised Amazon can afford it or rather the Centric Customer can right Funny all I needed was the numbers the fixes were easy and required little to no Capital Investment I had already demonstrated that the culture attitude and teamwork could improve I had coworkers thank me at the end of shifts for helping to change things My reward petty actions by small leaders They should try hiring a few mangers that know how to manage people and have a little experience in distribution processes or at least someone with common sense enough to identify something terribly wrong Its tough when you have an ownership mentality and go against the status quo to improve things and they couldnt care anymore than the latest employee to get terminated The worst part for me to accept is that I know that with a little effort all those problems could be fixed and the employees would actually feel included part of a team and not have to overwork themselves to try to hit numbers I tried to explaining to a couple managers that felt people just needed to move faster the concept of Speed and Quality as being incompatible terminology That only efficiency and quality were compatible They looked at me with a coked head and blank expression like my dog does when he heres a dog bark on the TV huh Amazon does a good job marketing to their external and internal customer Although their internal and some external Marketing Messages are nothing more than lipstick on a pig Because the message does not match the action and words have little value its the actions that give them value Im sure there are good managers and executives in all departments I just never met any of them There are better places to work because most new hires at amazon dont last long enough to take care advantage of the amazing benefits But truthfully I think these big companies that promote employee benefits to their customers like I dont know maybe the two largest Are really just creating a false narrative for their own brand image Look at how good we take care of our employes dont you love us Which is why only a single digit number of employees likely get to take advantage Lets be honest there are certainly some very good employees that just want to do their job Why not offer them a small bonus or more time off in lue of something they will never use Maybe because it would actually cost so much that it would be to expenseives as a marketing strategy Think about this I was working on a project for free that I would say conservatively would have saved them close to 20 which would have gone to the bottom line But compared to the intangible and even greater number I feel like reducing turnover by 50 is a fair number But Amazon doesnt need that they already make too much money Just ask the average middle manager Last word of advice go on the amazon AZ and hidden on the second page of your personal information will be your supervisors name Of course that is subject to change with zero notice Any way find he or she or and get in their little group click Its your best chance at longterm survival Actually my supervisor was pretty good and seemed to care until he realized he was supposed to work on the project he had volunteered me for Then he became wheres Waldo So no currently I cannot recommend them as an employer I still purchase from them who else is able to get things I probably dont need to my front door the next day But I have noticed as have others their prices going up too bad they couldnt find a way to lower their cost at their distribution facilities Yea so no Im an aggravated customer too,Warehouse Associate,Former Employee,nan,Jun 10 2022
