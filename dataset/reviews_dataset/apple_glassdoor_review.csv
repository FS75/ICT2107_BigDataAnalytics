1,"We work with geniuses - in every department,   We create innovative products that thrill our customers and create new product categories -  who else can say that?","ZERO   ZERO   ZERO   work/life balance.   Execs have been saying for YEARS that they understand and will make it better.  But in actuality,  it gets worse every year!  It is obviously top management LIP SERVICE because if they meant it,  they could fix it tomorrow.   They have hundreds of BILLIONS in the bank.   If they REALLY cared about employee work/life balance,  they could bring aboard the right number of folks to make that issue dissolve.   Sick of hearing the lies.   Just don't lie about wanting to fix it,  when they clearly DON'T care",4.0
2,"The position is at home. The company is AMAZING. There are limitless advancement opportunities. You work with some very cool people and the leadership cares about your development. You may get coaching but you never get battered or belittled. The pay is decent and the benefits include, 401(k) match, stock purchase options, product discounts and discounts on services across many different areas, education assistance, child care assistance, paid vacation, sick time and other time off options, health club Reimbursment or bike cost set off. You get 1.5 time for OT and it's pretty much unlimited as long as you don't exceed 12 hours in a day or 59 total in a week.",The schedule changes every 90 days and you have to bid for your shifts so you never know what you are going to get. This makes it extremely hard to plan your life to far in advance. You are also pretty much assured to work a Saturday or Sunday.,5.0
3,"Working at Apple means that the things you work on get into the hands of hundreds of millions of people, literally. It's a lot of pressure to get things right and drives one to do the best work of their lives. 2+ years later I'm still blown away by the talent and creativity of people I work with.","It's a lot of work, teams are usually strapped for resources and under pressure to deliver on strict timelines leading to high stress and long hours at certain times during the year.",5.0
4,"Competitive Pay, Great Benefits, Amazing People, Great Work, Awesome Opportunities, Excellent Experiences, Great atmospheres in a beautiful store, no matter where you're working!",None! I had one of the best times ever at this company. Hopefully I stay to go on to corporate!,5.0
5,"- organized, structured, and corporatey: instruction manuals for literally every task, and clear order of operations for every single interaction you had. This made the job easy, if monotonous, for people who do well with structure, and frustratingly rigid for those who didn't enjoy structure/rules. 

- benefits were really what made it worthwhile to work there: great stock options, discounts on apple products, industry discounts on phone service plans","- poor scheduling practices: lead to inflexibility and inequality of hours and times 

- poor management and leadership: led to petty store politics, cliques, and favoritism. Often did not feel supported by management, and resorted to working with heads of department or coworkers for problems that management could have handled easily. 

- pay and raises: incredibly frustrating pay system. Salary was based on a rigid formula of performance, position, cost of labor (not cost of living) in your area, and the salary you started with. There was no nuance or humanity or sensibility to the way employees were paid. It was all up to the pay formula equation. So for example, store transfers and new hires would frequently make 20%–40% more per hour than employees with the same job who had been working at the store for many years, because their starting salary was higher (whether from starting in a location with a higher cost of labor, or starting more recently after a minimum wage had increased). Managers and leaders seemed to have their hands tied when it came to fixing this.",4.0
6,"Amazing pay. I went from making around $9/hr with Best Buy to $15/hr with Apple. Doing pretty much the same thing. (I ended my tenure at $20/hr) Prior to this I worked at Hollister, Target, Verizon, and Best Buy. This is, by far, the best retail experience you can have. Education reimbursement is what allowed me to leave retail altogether.","Very very busy most of the time. There weren't many days where we could just 'stand around'. The manager culture is absolutely horrible. They reward based on 'attitude' over skill. The feedback culture is completely corrupted, using extremely broad competencies to justify promotions for their favorite employees over skilled employees.",5.0
7,"Leadership continually fostered a place to freely share ideas, advocate for yourself and colleagues, as well as provide tools to better serve the retail store experience. Time management was heavily encouraged for well being, and the team supported one another when needed to meet those requirements.","Customers ranged from civilized to crotchety. If met with the latter, you could potentially be working with a customer for an alarming amount of time. Be prepared to be verbally assaulted by customers.",5.0
8,Get benefits and perks. This review isn’t based off contract work. This is a direct hire with over 5 years.,"No room to grow at all. If you come in as a T1, you can transition to T2 quickly but expect to be in the T2 role for a long time and all of the moves from T2 sometimes are considered as lateral moves and people have more responsibilities but the pay don’t change unless you are in management or a engineer.",5.0
9,"Pay was pretty good considering is retail, not to mention the perks such as discounted stocks, discounts on cell carrier plans. Lots of like minded individuals, a lot of great people to work with, most are part-timers going to school. Management did change around the beginning of 2022 and we lost some great leadership and co-workers.","not having a set work schedule, schedule varies every week.",3.0

11,"Pay: pay is great. Frequent raises to keep up with cost of living and to ensure everyone in your role is around the same pay rate. Benefits: amazing; benefits team actually does listen to employees and has implemented new benefits or changed old ones to make them more favorable for employees Incentives: ESPP and stock options that vest yearly, nice discount on products The name: honestly being able to say you work or worked for Apple opens a lot of doors that would otherwise be closed or much more difficult to open otherwise","It’s retail: inconsistent schedules which makes it incredibly hard to maintain any sort of routine or to make appointments without constantly inputting in off requests Customers: most of them are great, but the bad ones really put a sour taste in your mouth. There is a level of elitism with some customers that I haven’t experienced in other jobs, both pre and post-employment with Apple. NPS: it’s a useful tool to measure performance but too much stock is put into it considering how easy it is to drop a score. I’ve had my NPS score drop because even though the customer said my service was “impeccable”, the music in the store was too loud so they gave me a passive instead of a promoter. One detractor or passive survey drops a score so much that you have to get 5-10 promoters to make up for it. There is no appeals process to have the survey not count. It affects your numbers and can affect your raise/performance when review time comes around. Unrealistic expectations: I worked at the Genius Bar. By the time I left we were expected to take 3-4 appointments per hour where we were expected to not only troubleshoot/diagnose/resolve/check in for repair devices, but to also talk up AppleCare+, get a new business intro, talk about new products and upgrades, answer all customer questions, and learn/connect with the customer as a human. All of that CAN be done, but not in 15 minutes. That’s 1-2 appointments per hour, not 3-4. It didn’t matter how high your NPS or other metrics were, if you didn’t hit that 3-4 appointments per hour you were constantly pulled into “connections” with your connection leader to talk about it. Irritating. Leadership: inconsistent and very hit-or-miss. Some were very by-the-book and almost robotic, others were more human and understanding. Some had issues with micromanaging, no matter how many feedback conversations you had with them. Very few I felt I could actually trust. Lack of upward mobility: moving from specialist to expert is pretty easy. Anything beyond that gets significantly harder. Breaking into the corporate side is virtually impossible. Phone Support: there is a HUGE disconnect between phone support and store support. Phone support is awful, and they frequently lie and/or give incorrect information to customers, and store employees are left to clean up the mess and reset expectations.",3.0
12,Amazing culture and benefits. You work with diverse and insightful peers that all bring unique insights. Apple culture welcomes this diversity of different ways of thinking.,Must reflect a lot - if you struggle with that you develop the skill.,5.0
13,Great work environment and a lot of diversity and inclusion,Hours can sometimes be difficult to get,5.0
14,"Love working here, wouldn't trade it for anything",Can be long days and hours time to time,5.0
15,"As an employee, the benefits are the best part. Even part time employees qualify for health coverage, employee discounts, employee stock options, and paid vacation time.","Despite all the benefits, the actual wages that one is paid per hour could certainly be higher. While a base pay of around $20 an hour based on what part of the country you’re in is relatively high, it’s a drop in the bucket compared to how much profit the company turns annually. Wages could and should be higher.",4.0
16,"Apple has shown great care and support to all employees. The company cares so much about their employees to ensure that they are in a comfortable workspace and given opportunities to grow in the company. I've learned so much, training was more about what the company was about and what it stands for. I learn about the products and services a few days after the main training days. Employment and interview process is very intricate to ensure that the best hard workers would be given the chance to share their knowledge on the sales floor while also continuing to learn and grow from every interaction.","Since I was on a seasonal contract, I wish that they were given more room to expand and keep seasonal workers longer. In most cases they can, but due to how the economy is like right now, it is something they have to do with the company. Other than letting seasonals go, they have a really good system on how to support employees on and off the sales floor.",5.0
17,"Pretty good discounts, decent pay, good overall benefits. Gives you a start in a big company, easy to move up.",Retail is Retail. Having to deal with rich snobby customers gets really tiring really fast. Having to deal with managers pestering you about your numbers that don't reflect your work ethic is frustrating. Be weary that some locations participate in some predatory salesmen behavior just to get their numbers up. This can conflict with work performance if you're a decent human being.,3.0
18,"Everyone has a lot of motivation, and brings energy to the discussion. People are passionate about their work. Managers and directors are technically proficient and quite personable. Each day poses new, difficult challenges which is always really exciting. The inclusion and diversity is so refreshing, too. The facilities are amazing, and it's easy to accomplish work/tasks from anywhere. You have all of the tools and information available to you to execute your job. The cafes are also really great, and there are a ton of perks. I could go on and on about how much I enjoy my job.","Honestly, none that I can think of so far. The hours can be long, but it depends where you're at in your life. I don't have any personal obligations right now, so it's really easy for me to stay plugged in since I'm passionate about the product and mission, but I can empathize with those that might be at a different place in their life.",5.0
19,"Incredible meetings of minds, great facilities, open-minded workspace, people truly care and are devoted to their work. Incredible collaboration and reliable teammates. Kind, friendly, warm, approachable, teammates who become your family. People don't feel the need to prove themselves - just want to help the team and product.","12-13 hour days, pay for lunch (~$13), incredibly demanding level of perfection demanded. Hard to enjoy life outside of work when there is so much pressure and people depending on you for excellence.",4.0

23,"We didn't have sales quotas. The job was solely educating customers on products and providing great customer service. Great for those with no tech experience, apple will do all the internal work to train you. What they look for are people who are passionate and go above and beyond with customer service. Being a people's person!","Certain stores have a harder time with internal growth than others. After I left the company (not no bad terms), I still had friends who worked for apple who were looking to progress and work up the ladder. After I recommended leaving that particular store (Apple Fifth Ave) and transferring to another location, their career development was immediate. Be mindful for environments that speak about professional development and growth but do act on the practice. This happened with multiple people. However this is my only con, everything else about the company is great.",4.0

29,"Working in the Apple store is a lot of fun. You're offered a lot of autonomy in how you interact with customers, and many of those interactions can be super engaging, fulfilling, and friendly.","It was a bit stressful to try to keep a perfect customer service rating, as a single mistake even as you are just learning will severely drop your score. Coming in as a seasonal hire also makes it a more competitive environment to try to get a full-time role than you might expect coming into an entry-level retail job.",5.0

56,Decent pay considering lack of requirements for work history or education. Generally good environment where your relationships with coworkers makes all the difference. The vibe on the technical support and repair side of things tends to be pretty close knit and supportive of each other. Benefits for part timers are decent and have gotten better over the last couple years.,Really varies depending on your particular store and leadership. You can only really move up if you fully buy into the culture which can feel cultish. Corporate bureaucracy can often complicate things that should be simple.,4.0
57,"Apple has a very competitive pay and benefits structure when compared with other retail locations. Apple is laser-focused on DEI, which has been helping to elevate under-represented community members. Apple retail workers are largely educated, and interesting individuals. It's a fun environment","Apple is not a normal retailer. Retail workers create tickets for emerging tech issues, complete complicated repairs, overcome extremely angry customers on a daily basis, and many other complex and ambiguous tasks, but are still paid as though they fold jeans or sell hammers (having close friends within clothing and home goods retailers, the pay is within 5-10%). The work is not equitable with the pay. While there has been a focus on DEI, and elevating minorities, Apple does not have many pipelines for upward mobility from within Retail. Unlike myself, most teammates are unable to move into leadership within 5 years of starting at Apple. 5 years is a career-lifetime in our modern business environment, so Apple loses many skilled people who want upward mobility.",2.0

You build vacation/sick time by the hours you work each pay period. Management is toxic. They will hold you to standards that they themselves don’t abide by. They come and go as they please if they even show up at all yet they still get paid because they’re salary. It’s a buddy club at the management level. You have your manager, they report to an area manager, and the area manager reports to a senior area manager. They all do the same shady thing where they collect a paycheck but barely show up so you will never see a manager get fired because all of the shady behavior is just swept under the rug and hidden from upper management. Not to mention that all these different tiers of management work mostly from home so there’s nobody above them that has eyes on them. If upper management wasn’t so clueless they’d see that there’s absolutely no reason for three different tiers of management. Upper management has recently implemented a policy in which people who were working from home even long before the pandemic are no longer going to be considered for promotions unless they move to an on-site location. Management will counter that claim by saying it’s all about who you know, and developing your skills but they don’t give you time off the phones to better yourself. The training is very poor in quality too. You will never have weekends or holidays off and if you do it’s a rarity. Also, the hours of operation are horrible. AppleCare goes by Central Time hours which is 7AM-10PM Central. What this means that if you live outside of the Pacific time zone you are working later hours which is horrible in my opinion. Forget having a work-life balance if you’re on the east coast. And here’s the worst part, your schedule is not fixed. You have to bid on a new shift every few months and that process is very convoluted because it’s based on job performance, not seniority. As far as the metrics they use to judge your performance, they’re near impossible to meet. A large part of the metrics are based on customer surveys which basically means you’re on the front lines taking bad surveys from customers who are not necessarily upset at you but are angry with Apple’s products or their policies. So you’re punished with a horrible schedule for things that are entirely out of your control. Raises are not that great. If I average out my yearly pay increase since I’ve been here it comes out to an $1.78 dollar increase each year. To me that is just not great considering the cost of living and the fact that Apple has no problem giving stock grants to privileged board members.",1.0

Retail workers create tickets for emerging tech issues, complete complicated repairs, overcome extremely angry customers on a daily basis, and many other complex and ambiguous tasks, but are still paid as though they fold jeans or sell hammers (having close friends within clothing and home goods retailers, the pay is within 5-10%). The work is not equitable with the pay. While there has been a focus on DEI, and elevating minorities, Apple does not have many pipelines for upward mobility from within Retail.

165,I began working for Apple in 2015 and was initially impressed and excited about the job because it was my first remote position.,"As a chat advisor, you'll be expected to take up to 3 chats at a time. When I first started at Apple, it was only 1 chat at a time. It was increased to 3 fairly quickly but the chat quality standards never changed at all. You have 2 minutes to respond to every customer which is fine on one chat. But when you're on 3 chats at a time that means you have only 40 seconds per customer to read their message, research the answer, provide resources and explain the next step. It's nearly impossible achieve, let alone maintain for 8 hours. You're being set up to fail. Your entire life is scheduled down to the minute. You have to ask for any extra time you need away from your desk. For example, the day my dog was being put to sleep, I asked for an extra break to compose myself and was told I would need to clock out entirely for 15 minutes and take the time unpaid instead of just allowing me a small break while on the clock. At review time, you won't receive a decent raise unless you've ""Exceeded"" in all areas of your job but this is difficult to do when you have to ask/beg for time out of the chat queue to do special projects and make a name for yourself. It's entirely up to your specific manager whether you have the opportunity to succeed or not. Even when you are able to develop something to share with the area managers, they often drop the ball and your project goes nowhere or you find later that someone else is implementing the changes that you presented and you get no recognition for it. There's very little chance of being promoted up and out of the customer service side of the business as you won't be given the time or direction needed to improve your skills, mentor with other departments or receive any additional training outside of your role. Apple increasingly relies on vendors to provide their chat and phone customer service. The vendors have less training and are often coached to ""just send it to T2"" before they've even completed basic steps. Customers are frustrated because they spent time being transferred for a simple issue. As a T2 advisor, you then receive the customer's survey and you're scored down based on the actions of the T1 advisor. There is no way to reassign surveys even if the other advisor was mentioned by name and the survey clearly wasn't for you. Last year, Apple decided to move all of their internal chat advisors over to phone support. If you had an existing medical accommodation related to hearing loss or PTSD or anything else, you either had to give up your accommodation to make the move or find another job within the company that would accommodate you...which was impossible. I was put on a 30 day job search to do this and, despite a position being available for me to take that would accommodate me, I was not allowed to take it because the actual move to phone support was still upcoming. I would not be allowed into the open position until the day of the transition and the position closed before that date. I ended up reaching out to the EEOC about this who informed me that this is practice was NOT within the EEOC guidelines (An employee is supposed to receive the accommodation when THEY need it.. not when Apple needs it). Ultimately I left Apple because my last manager was extremely overbearing, very much a micro-manager and continually gave us tasks that would take us away from the chat queue but would refuse to give us additional time to complete them. Projects I had started on my previous team were taken away from me. Reports of system issues and downtime were not taken seriously and I constantly had to ""cover my Apple"" because any deviation away from your schedule was seen as suspicious. I recorded nearly 300 system issues resulting in downtime over a 2 year period complete with screenshots, screen recordings, internal IT tickets and personal notes but this was still not taken seriously. After asking multiple times (my area manager and HR) to be removed from this team, I was told that my manger was going on a rotation and I wouldn't have to speak to him again because of the move to phone support. However, my area manager then had him call me outside of work hours, while I was on medical leave, to ask me to login and work. I brought this back to my area manager who then responded by saying ""I didn't think it was so serious"".. despite my asking multiple times to be removed from a team being run by a person I found to be oppressive, hateful, and abusive. After leaving Apple, I spent about 6 months in therapy having been diagnosed with Major Depression and Agoraphobia (feeling unable to escape bad situations) caused directly by the interaction I had with the manager in question. Bottom line.. I was in an unhealthy and mentally unsafe environment and Apple REFUSED to do anything about it and even put me back into direct contact with the offender all the while ignoring and refusing to accommodate my medical status despite an option being open and available. One more thing (see what I did there?), Apple claims to believe in diversity and inclusion however this does not appear to extend to people with disabilities. Their D&L website only highlights their Black@Apple and LGBTQ+ groups. Folks with disabilities are ignored and simply not highlighted or even listened to.",2.0

302,I began working for Apple in 2015 and was initially impressed and excited about the job because it was my first remote position.,"As a chat advisor, you'll be expected to take up to 3 chats at a time. When I first started at Apple, it was only 1 chat at a time. It was increased to 3 fairly quickly but the chat quality standards never changed at all. You have 2 minutes to respond to every customer which is fine on one chat. But when you're on 3 chats at a time that means you have only 40 seconds per customer to read their message, research the answer, provide resources and explain the next step. It's nearly impossible achieve, let alone maintain for 8 hours. You're being set up to fail. Your entire life is scheduled down to the minute. You have to ask for any extra time you need away from your desk. For example, the day my dog was being put to sleep, I asked for an extra break to compose myself and was told I would need to clock out entirely for 15 minutes and take the time unpaid instead of just allowing me a small break while on the clock. At review time, you won't receive a decent raise unless you've ""Exceeded"" in all areas of your job but this is difficult to do when you have to ask/beg for time out of the chat queue to do special projects and make a name for yourself. It's entirely up to your specific manager whether you have the opportunity to succeed or not. Even when you are able to develop something to share with the area managers, they often drop the ball and your project goes nowhere or you find later that someone else is implementing the changes that you presented and you get no recognition for it. There's very little chance of being promoted up and out of the customer service side of the business as you won't be given the time or direction needed to improve your skills, mentor with other departments or receive any additional training outside of your role. Apple increasingly relies on vendors to provide their chat and phone customer service. The vendors have less training and are often coached to ""just send it to T2"" before they've even completed basic steps. Customers are frustrated because they spent time being transferred for a simple issue. As a T2 advisor, you then receive the customer's survey and you're scored down based on the actions of the T1 advisor. There is no way to reassign surveys even if the other advisor was mentioned by name and the survey clearly wasn't for you. Last year, Apple decided to move all of their internal chat advisors over to phone support. If you had an existing medical accommodation related to hearing loss or PTSD or anything else, you either had to give up your accommodation to make the move or find another job within the company that would accommodate you...which was impossible. I was put on a 30 day job search to do this and, despite a position being available for me to take that would accommodate me, I was not allowed to take it because the actual move to phone support was still upcoming. I would not be allowed into the open position until the day of the transition and the position closed before that date. I ended up reaching out to the EEOC about this who informed me that this is practice was NOT within the EEOC guidelines (An employee is supposed to receive the accommodation when THEY need it.. not when Apple needs it). Ultimately I left Apple because my last manager was extremely overbearing, very much a micro-manager and continually gave us tasks that would take us away from the chat queue but would refuse to give us additional time to complete them. Projects I had started on my previous team were taken away from me. Reports of system issues and downtime were not taken seriously and I constantly had to ""cover my Apple"" because any deviation away from your schedule was seen as suspicious. I recorded nearly 300 system issues resulting in downtime over a 2 year period complete with screenshots, screen recordings, internal IT tickets and personal notes but this was still not taken seriously. After asking multiple times (my area manager and HR) to be removed from this team, I was told that my manger was going on a rotation and I wouldn't have to speak to him again because of the move to phone support. However, my area manager then had him call me outside of work hours, while I was on medical leave, to ask me to login and work. I brought this back to my area manager who then responded by saying ""I didn't think it was so serious"".. despite my asking multiple times to be removed from a team being run by a person I found to be oppressive, hateful, and abusive. After leaving Apple, I spent about 6 months in therapy having been diagnosed with Major Depression and Agoraphobia (feeling unable to escape bad situations) caused directly by the interaction I had with the manager in question. Bottom line.. I was in an unhealthy and mentally unsafe environment and Apple REFUSED to do anything about it and even put me back into direct contact with the offender all the while ignoring and refusing to accommodate my medical status despite an option being open and available. One more thing (see what I did there?), Apple claims to believe in diversity and inclusion however this does not appear to extend to people with disabilities. Their D&L website only highlights their Black@Apple and LGBTQ+ groups. Folks with disabilities are ignored and simply not highlighted or even listened to.",2.0

311,"Good pay Allure of working for ""Apple"" because of Steve Job's legacy and high quality products Good food at caffe Macs Apple product discounts","Absolutely toxic. This company will eat your soul and spit it back at you, at least in hardware engineering. Management collectively uses fear and shame-based motivation. Team members are expected to present frequently to large groups with lots of shame and hostility toward people who either do not have certain expected tasks complete, have not made proper judgment calls, do not have the full depth of analysis that is expected, etc even when one is burning themselves out working over 65 hrs a weak to try to keep up. As a DRI (directly responsible individual) you own everything and are expected to do everything, even though management may tell you that ""some things can fall through the cracks"". When you complain about ""quality of life"", they pretend to hear you, but will immediately try to convince you that you are wrong. The management actively gas-lights people when they complain, contributing the lack of time or bandwidth that one has to their own time management issues. Working here is like actively living in an insane asylum. There is no social life, it's just awkward, no one is encouraged to talk or socialize, just to get your work done. Pay is the only thing that keeps people here. For several years I have worked until 11-p or as late as 4am consistently for 4 days a weak, Fridays ending early sometimes as early as 6pm. I've seen people with children do this years on end, they have no life. The question is why? Is your true sense of self value derived so deeply from this work? It probably shouldn't be.

- Amazing sense of belonging and community
- great stepping stone to new career, if that is your choice","- Too much ""drinking the kool aid"". WAY too much. I hope this is an apt metaphor: Imagine you have an 8oz cup in your hand. They pour a 64oz pitcher of Kool-Aid into your 8oz. cup. Then they pour a pitcher of sugar into the same cup. You get diabetes. The amount of company propaganda is absolutely astounding and excessive to point of being absolutely ridiculous, wherein you feel like a caricature of yourself wearing this blue shirt. This is coming from me, a lifelong Apple fan since 1987 (the year I started using computers).
- FAR too much bashing of anything that isn't Apple. Apple has now decided as a company, to compare itself to Samsung and Google, etc etc. It used to decide not to compare itself to anybody. This shows everywhere from development to retail attitudes.
- Willing isolation from and ignorance of the rest of the world of technology. Apple exists in a bubble, and those within the bubble are blissfully unaware that any other technology is relevant and useful. I heard one employee say that Microsoft Office is going the way of the dinosaurs. Nobody called him out on this. What dream world is he living in???? Isn't it better to learn Apple's technology in a way that helps it workably coexist with other technology? This is equally as important as learning the Apple ecosystem, which, yes, in itself is amazing.
- Training is too general, not specific enough to help sharpen one's technical skill set on a consistent basis.
- No ongoing training program to keep your technical skills sharp and up to date. Instead, they offer ""Pathways"", which is meant to improve your social skills. Great! But isn't that why they hired us to begin with? You have to search Apple's technical reporting system for relevant known issues, which is fine but if you don't (and a lot of techs don't)  you usually find out what those are when a customer has a problem and you don't know the answer. One person who happened to look at iDesk might know the answer, but if they're not available, you may end up giving the customer the wrong solution. The signal to noise ratio of important, specific information is a total mess.
- ""I can't believe they re-arranged the lockers. I'm thinking about quitting now."" Everyone joins in agreement. Really, guys? C'mon. Again, as I mentioned in my point about the Apple ""bubble"", the perception of reality can be largely distorted. Management has to work REALLY REALLY hard to bend over backwards for every little thing. So how much energy do they have left over to make sure their techs are up to date, or that sales staff knows their specs and has good ways of explaining tech to non-tech people? Apple is very big on managing expectations for customers (great, actually!) but could do a lot better to manage expectations for employees. Maybe this would improve management's time and ability to fix some more important issues.

453,"- Great benefits 
- great work environment
- great salary (especially for retail)
- lots of peer support
- lots of management support
- lots of learning experiences and resources
- opportunity for advancement
- opportunities for ""career experiences"" in corporate roles, for retail staff (underutilized, apparently. go for it!)
- you become really good friends with your peer group, or maybe even family!
- Amazing sense of belonging and community
- great stepping stone to new career, if that is your choice","- Too much ""drinking the kool aid"". WAY too much. I hope this is an apt metaphor: Imagine you have an 8oz cup in your hand. They pour a 64oz pitcher of Kool-Aid into your 8oz. cup. Then they pour a pitcher of sugar into the same cup. You get diabetes. The amount of company propaganda is absolutely astounding and excessive to point of being absolutely ridiculous, wherein you feel like a caricature of yourself wearing this blue shirt. This is coming from me, a lifelong Apple fan since 1987 (the year I started using computers).
- FAR too much bashing of anything that isn't Apple. Apple has now decided as a company, to compare itself to Samsung and Google, etc etc. It used to decide not to compare itself to anybody. This shows everywhere from development to retail attitudes.
- Willing isolation from and ignorance of the rest of the world of technology. Apple exists in a bubble, and those within the bubble are blissfully unaware that any other technology is relevant and useful. I heard one employee say that Microsoft Office is going the way of the dinosaurs. Nobody called him out on this. What dream world is he living in???? Isn't it better to learn Apple's technology in a way that helps it workably coexist with other technology? This is equally as important as learning the Apple ecosystem, which, yes, in itself is amazing.
- Training is too general, not specific enough to help sharpen one's technical skill set on a consistent basis.
- No ongoing training program to keep your technical skills sharp and up to date. Instead, they offer ""Pathways"", which is meant to improve your social skills. Great! But isn't that why they hired us to begin with? You have to search Apple's technical reporting system for relevant known issues, which is fine but if you don't (and a lot of techs don't)  you usually find out what those are when a customer has a problem and you don't know the answer. One person who happened to look at iDesk might know the answer, but if they're not available, you may end up giving the customer the wrong solution. The signal to noise ratio of important, specific information is a total mess.
- ""I can't believe they re-arranged the lockers. I'm thinking about quitting now."" Everyone joins in agreement. Really, guys? C'mon. Again, as I mentioned in my point about the Apple ""bubble"", the perception of reality can be largely distorted. Management has to work REALLY REALLY hard to bend over backwards for every little thing. So how much energy do they have left over to make sure their techs are up to date, or that sales staff knows their specs and has good ways of explaining tech to non-tech people? Apple is very big on managing expectations for customers (great, actually!) but could do a lot better to manage expectations for employees. Maybe this would improve management's time and ability to fix some more important issues.
- Far too many points of contact for customers. A customer may end up talking to between 4 and 8 different people who may end up telling them lots of conflicting things. Either communication needs to improve in the store or the number of contact points needs to decrease somehow.",5.0

The employee stock purchase program (ESPP) is the primary reason to stay employed.   ,"No advancement opportunities within retail.  If you become a genius there is a chance to land a corporate role, but the cost of living offsets the financial reasoning to move.  Many associates complain that they were working themselves to the bone but saving less than they did when in retail.  Managers are absolutely oblivious to their staff; self absorbed with their ambitions ferociously guided by their own career ambitions.  The management is daft, insincere, unhelpful in any regard, and absolutely metrics obsessed.  They only want to know about metrics os they have something to say to senior leaders to make themselves seem intelligent/productive, when in reality they just hide in the managers office throughout their shifts shifting all of their work onto Leads and other team members.  There is no access to sunlight within the building and the air quality is rancid due to all of the people being isolated within the store (no windows, only one large entry door where guests enter).  Seniority puts you at a higher risk of termination because Management wants to save on payroll.  Managers have no respect for individual associates; only team metrics.
