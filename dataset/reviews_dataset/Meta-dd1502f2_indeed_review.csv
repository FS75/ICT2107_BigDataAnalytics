The ball is completely in my court. If anything is falling short, all I have to do is work with my manager on how to fix it. The only thing I don’t like right now is the uncertainty of layoffs constantly in the air. if layoffs could ever subside, I would love to get back to living the work in the company again.","Fully remote work, encouraged, management is excellent, it’s easy to get promoted and move up, tons of opportunity for advancement, rewarding work","Layoffs create uncertainty and cause stress for teams, making it difficult to navigate relationships and team dynamics right now.",Content Designer,Current Employee,Remote,"March 7, 2023"

More metric heavy than KPI, depending on where you work. The more niche the role you're sourcing for...the better. The people are great, smart and helpful.

4.0,Good place to work but have to consider about impact all the time,"The work is meaningful and can be used by millions of users, which would make you satisfied.

3.0,Great talents but lack of directions,"I was in the management role and felt lucky to work with a great team of talented individual contributors. Sadly, I can’t say the same about the senior management and cross org leadership. Teams have been overworked since hiring freeze early this year, while being told to “work more with less.” It’s not worth to sacrifice one’s health and personal life to compensate the lack of vision and focus due to leadership mismanagement.",,,Product Design Manager,Former Employee,Remote,"November 20, 2022"

2.0,It's Something...,"It's good if you have nothing else. It'll pay you decent, however, management needs work, and fail to admit it. You'll have a hard time if you aren't ready to take a few punches before excelling. It's definitely a corporate job, even though they'll tell you otherwise.

If you want to build resume, come here. You'll gain some experience but you'll mental health will be as drained as possible. It's definitely a STEPPING STONE kind of company, not a company you'd want to spend 10+ years at.

So, overall, I'd give this company a 3. Great for experience but if you already got that, run.",,,Social Media Coordinator,Current Employee,"Austin, TX","September 8, 2022"

1.0,"Amazing benefits, worst work life balance","Great perks and benefits working there, even for remote employees. Lots of opportunities for training and to learn from the best in your field.
Extremely competitive environment. Cut throat culture in my group. Employees are driven by individual performance reviews (PSC) only and are lacking any true motivation and meaning in their work.

My workplace culture is the best I can experience I'm able to outline all details on positives living. The hardest part is getting people to understand you can't keep picking with someone who is ready to move forward you can't stand tall in front of someone life when they have achievements.The most enjoyable part of the job is when others get to tell others about what's going on in a field and they did not want that as expectations and they give you that face and fist fight that's very enjoyable in my life as a growth person I love it here.",,,Facebook Challenge Specialist - Remote,Former Employee,"West Monroe, LA","July 31, 2022"

5.0,it alright,"they have provided me with insight into what it is like to work for a forward thinking and balanced business with an amazing culture.
They show in many ways that they care for their team and want them to be compensated, rewarded and praised for their efforts.
Their level of care extends beyond monetary, they have an open leave policy, implemented extra mandatory days off during COVID to help individuals manage stress or pressure and help improve work life balance.
They have a plethora of diversity groups and constantly address what is happening around the world to ensure everyone feels supported and accepted.",,,cleaner,Former Employee,cleaner,"July 18, 2022"

5.0,Love working at Meta!,"I’ve been at Meta (previously Facebook) for a few years & overall love it. My team is very close & supportive. I’ve been able to learn a ton and really grow into the role. Meta is a high performance culture so I constantly feel pushed to be better which has been good for my growth but it can lead to some long weeks & mentally tiring.

The compensation is very generous compared to my previous role outside of tech. The only con is that the org can be very political (as is true for most big companies) which leads to frustration & as we’ve grown benefits have started to shift. Overall though, the company puts a lot of investment in helping its employees feel fulfilled in their role & if you focus on impact your work will be rewarded.",,,Manager,Current Employee,"Austin, TX","April 7, 2022"

3.0,"Innovative company, but suffers from some chaos","I am in a non-tech role at Meta. It is exciting to be at the forefront of some exciting new innovations in the tech space, but the company's structure (or lack thereof) leads to a bit of frustrating chaos that could benefit from a leader early on (rather than the bottom-up development that's common now).

Otherwise, the people are great, and the amenities and benefits are hard to beat. I pay very little for health care, and can have all three meals for free if I am in the office. The atmosphere is also flexible with coming in versus working at home, though this may be team-dependent.

The performance review system leaves a lot to be desired; there is a lot of pressure to make measurable ""impact,"" and some roles just don't function that way and are more reactive.","Free meals, flexibility",A lot of fire drills in non-tech roles,Policy Manager,Current Employee,United States,"April 2, 2022"

3.0,bad,"FB expects a lot out of engineers, and you can't slack off. Of course, you shouldn't slack off at any job, but since FB is pretty fast-paced, there is a risk that you'll have trouble adjusting at first.

FB has a lot of custom infrastructure and tools, and prehaps more impressively, it works great. It makes doing your job really great, but on the other hand, you'll end up learning a lot of stuff that won't be applicable elsewhere.

FB's code-base is very good in some ways, but in other ways, it's not as great as some of the existing engineers think it is. I don't think this is that big of a deal, but the important part is that as an engineer, you need to quickly learn FB's values and practices and ""get with the program"" so to speak. If you don't like some things, then you just have to deal with it, as it's not likely you're going to change people's minds at this point. The nice thing is that things are at least very consistent.",,,officer,Former Employee,space,"March 18, 2022"

4.0,"Lasseiz-faire position, wonderful community, competitive team environment.","I have really taken a liking to this position after having worked as a Brand Influencer for 4 months!
My efforts do not go unnoticed during our frequent team meetings and although infrequent there are incentives that spice things up for us sales reps; paired with an energetic and attentive manager there is a strong drive for many of us to be the absolute best and it shows in how fast product comes and goes at locations with vs. without BI's.
Your participation at your location is on you to be accountable for so planning your day and meeting personal goals is my best way of keeping myself on track. Also to note that there are extensive trainings required and optional for all employees to perform this job correctly and effectively.

3.0,Good place to work as a noob (out of school),"Do you believe in their mission and the direction they are going and actions (corrective) they have taken?
It started out as connecting people together and bringing the world together, which is fine. Now it seems they want you to be in their metaverse universe where you create a “twin” of yourself in the internet so you can live and also conduct commerce and be bombarded with ads.

2.0,So Phony,"Facebook has incredible pay and benefits but is rotten to the core. After working there, I do not believe the company truly cares about the evil it causes around the world. It sees threats everywhere, and no one is allowed to question its mission or practices.
Internally, the promotion system is shallow and a constant source of stress. It's Lord of the Flies disguised as utopia. If you want to work somewhere where you will literally be coached to keep a phony smile on your face and pretend all your work is solid gold, no matter how worthless it is, this is your company.",,,Facebook Analyst,Former Employee,"Menlo Park, CA","July 15, 2021"

2.0,Burned out at 3 months,"Go and do your best but set your expectations very low of what you'll actually be able to accomplish unless you have all the evenings and weekends in the world to spend on work. Then enjoy!

Going remote has made it even more difficult to understand what's going on, especially if you're new.

Unless you are obsessed with your job 24/7 you will have no idea what you're supposed to be doing until 1-1.5 years in (that's how long most folks told me it took before things finally started to make sense). It's much easier to be ""homegrown"" at Facebook and work your way up to digest the culture, rather than coming in totally new. Former interns or those who started at the bottom and transferred internally seem to do really well (understanding and thriving in FB culture is key here).

1.0,Milestone is joke,"For all that need extra money, it is a great place to work and it is flexible. Your job as a Screening Associate is to take the temperature of everyone who walks in.

But be aware. If you are there, most times you are an acting babysitter. Staff from other companies think they are superior to you and do not follow Facebook protocol, in terms of keeping Covid safe. They tend to not properly wear their masks, keep distancing etc. Your job is to remind them as well, but they can become hostile and disobedient. Even find reasons for to get you in trouble. In other words - they are a bunch of careless baby adults. Milestone's own employees do the same, which sets a bad example.

Management will schedule you for a shift, and someone else would be scheduled at the same time. Leading you to have to go home. Which isn't professional as well. Would suck if you lived further away.
They are aware of all the things the other employees do in terms of not keeping Covid safe, but continue to do nothing.

It is confusing because if you want to maintain safety measures, it isn't a place to do that. They were created for that sole purpose. Just work there until you can find a better place.",,,Screening Associate,Former Employee,All Buildings,"October 19, 2020"

Being here in Product or Engineering is near the peak most can hope to achieve career wise. However, some of the other orgs such as Operations have a sense of non-belonging. Definitely can still achieve a lot of success and get paid more than fairly, but its hard not to compare to the “A+” orgs.

5.0,Facebook sets the standard,"Facebook works to properly dazzle its employees, and does a lot to keep them happy and productive. Free food in the break rooms, mobile vendors visiting the campus, mandatory visit to their central campus for onboarding at their Menlo Park campus, they do their best to dazzle their own employees. The entrance process is an intensive, often rigorous 4-6 stage interview, (which I avoided due to it being an outreach position), but once you're there, they do their best to keep you on site and productive, with team building, copious amenities, and an absolutely immediate positive responsiveness to any and all work culture issues.

They're a forward thinking company with a wonderful culture that reinforces ideas, and encourages all within it. Their corporate leadership does not at all reflect the rank and file, and it's definitely a workplace to reach out to and get into.",,,Cooperative Education Student,Former Employee,"Los Lunas, NM","September 6, 2020"

1.0,Malevolent Smoke and Mirrors,"My FB org hired extremely over-qualified employees to create a never-ending dog and pony show. I cannot stress this enough, the work itself was almost entirely meaningless, and they knew it. The emphasis was on projecting the illusion to higher leadership that the org was useful and worthy of additional resources.
Information provided during the hiring process (including job responsibilities and potential transfer, advancement, and location options) proved to be untrue. Management had no shame when it came to establishing unrealistic expectations and could quickly devolve into pettiness if called out for it. Honest feedback was never welcomed, only compliance. We were expected to smile and be pleasant at all times, regardless of how much unimpactful work was heaped upon us (and often demanded urgently). I was told at one point ""this is tech, where everyone fakes it until they make it,"" which I found disgusting and untrue. Tech did not get to where it is today by only pretending to offer value.
The horrible performance review process required employees and managers to rate one another (not anonymously), and a certain number of workers were required to fail, regardless of performance. The managers would formally gather to argue over which employees could meet expectations, which equated to rewarding employees with a reputation for being smiley and compliant. Mentioning or trying to fix problems (aka innovating) painted a target on workers' backs.
The amount of bureaucracy, inflexibility, inefficiency, and substandard software was shocking for a tech company. The mixed messaging",,,Analyst Programmer,Former Employee,"Menlo Park, CA","July 22, 2020"
3.0,Elitist Culture,"This is a data driven culture that doesn't understand that data can be bent or skewed to drive a specific initiative. It's a good place to work, but you definitely need to have eyes in the back of your head because people at this company will take advantage of kind people for their own benefit. Speaking loud, interrupting others, and showing aggression is often rewarded at this company.",,,Manager,Former Employee,"Menlo Park, CA","July 10, 2020"
4.0,Great company,"If you've just been to a really great — or truly awful — business, you probably want to tell someone about it.

4.0,Good career; super political,"Good opportunities for career advancement. However a ton of people are SUPER political. Prepare to be made very unwelcome if you are anything but very far to the left.

2.0,Great pay but at a huge mental cost,"Wonderful pay and perks. Some pretty cool projects and smart people but your mileage will vary depending on which team you're on. Some teams are great, others not so great. Lots of ego and toxic bully behavior triggered by their stack ranking performance evaluations so everyone is competing against peers. They literally encourage people to talk behind people's backs (it's called providing peer feedback). Sometimes it goes out of hand because management sucks on average. They promote people with zero people skills, zero problem solving skills, zero team building skills and empathy to managers. Really, it takes more than taking your team out for lunch once in a while to call yourself a manager.
Diversity is a PR stunt only - they hire you for the stats, they boast about their diversity programs all while don't care about retention rates (they keep those secret). They really are a white-boys-under-25 club. I heard reports of people doing drugs to outperform peers and win the rat race towards a raise. One of my peers used to send pull requests at 2 am on a regular basis.
All in all a great company but each team has its own little micro-culture that may be toxic and you may be stuck. I joined for the company, left because of a manager.",,,Software Developer,Former Employee,"Seattle, WA","April 13, 2020"

2.0,Don't be fooled,"Just because it's Facebook doesn't mean it is all milk and honey. If you're here and you're contracted, you mean nothing. You're less than a number. Of course, great free perks even for the contingent workers, like unlimited free food and snacks and tech vending machines. But if you look at someone in management the wrong way, you could get cut.

1.0,Worst Company Ever,"Facebook is the worst experience in my career so far. The culture is toxic and management is a bunch of bullies in Community Operations. You can summarise it as you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours my Irish friend - yes you read it correct. Irish people have massive influence in company and they keep on hiring their friends, old colleagues etc. If they say we still have the start up culture / environment, don't believe it :) It is the most toxic, fake environment ever.

During the interview process, I was given many false promises about my role and my responsibilities. However, the reality was quite the opposite, I was bullied on a daily basis. They just squeeze you like a lemon on a daily basis. I've never seen employees going on sick leave / having mental issues like this before. Turn over is really high, 5 managers left (or were forced to leave as a result of BULLYING) in the space of 2-3 months. Everybody is talking about impact all the time but nobody can define it.

3.0,Caste System Socially Toxic,"Facebook as a business model, has 0 strategy for analyzing why something failed as far as management development goes and employee happiness. They just keep going on, hiring new people instead of investing in existing employees. Having a system mindset - analyzing why something failed, investigating the failure, and looking at the decision making choices that led to this failing is completely absent from Facebook's management team. They contract and subcontract work out, and make contract workers feel less than human in a caste system of social hierarchy. Even this would be ok, if the social aspect wasn't toxic as well. Facebook encouraged people to refer their friends, but at one point, over 20 people worked there connected all to the same group of friends which led to bullying, harassment, trolling, and all types of horrible behavior in the workplace - it became a mob. Instead of analyzing why this happened, an incentivizing improvement, or investing in professional development, they punished people for not fitting in and ignored the problems destroying productivity. On the surface Facebook sounds like they encourage innovation when in reality they reward conformity in a very unhealthy social environment lacking equal standards applied to everyone.",,,Advertising Executive,Former Employee,"Austin, TX","January 21, 2020"

5.0,Fun place to work,in few words Facebook is a great place to work. However when you are a contractor your opportunities get reduced significantly. You have to do whatever the team lead need you too. So you have a quite small room to be creative and innovative.

1.0,"Felt like a cult, but with none of the upsides","Management talked the talk of embracing diversity, but so authoritarian. Workers treated like livestock.

1.0,Terrible management,"Firstly, 7 interviews, some of which are from untrained personnel.
The company itself is okay, but local management can be a bit self centred and narcissistic. Some even consider it like a fashion show.
Some sycophants get away with doing very little due to their brown-nosing and telling tales on other staff. Beware of passive aggressive behaviour and snide little remarks when management are around.
Off sites are crazy, you will rarely get a week without some boring mandatory dinner or other activity, and its painful listening to the same stories every week on forced activities. Can't see why you cant be left alone once you finish work.

Good company, poor management, and some folk are brainwashed.",,,General Operative,Former Employee,Dublin,"December 12, 2019"

4.0,Excellent opportunity for the very ambitious,"Facebook hires very very young and extremely bright young people from all over the world. They then provide you with what I felt was an MBA level training in how to work the right way. This included: dealing with conflict (fast feedback), meeting cadences, star charts to evaluate work and get buy-in from peers on priorities, gobs and gobs of information and documents to do your job. BUT, and it's a big but, it is all self-directed. In other words, you must be able to thrive in ambiguity and be motivated to seek out the info you need.

4.0,Work Hard but Satisfied,"The work is challenging and plentiful but it's also very satisfying and your teammates are excellent. Definitely having the right mindset for this company matters. Somebody who is self motivated and ready to be jump head first into something they don't know can succeed in this environment. In my opinion it feels like people aren't competing against each other, rather they are competing against themselves to see how far they can grow. Every single day you are working hard, but you will improve a lot too.",,,Software Engineer,Current Employee,"Seattle, WA","November 10, 2019"

I had no problem with the work life balance which was mandated for me as a contractor. My team and manager were nothing short of awesome and it was an incredible opportunity to learn from some of the brightest minds in the field of AR/VR.

1.0,Do not waste your time,"Facebook hires people through 2 contractors. you first have to be with BC-forward, then Accenture. If you do not fit the mold then you'll never be Accenture. Once you are at Accenture long enough then you have a chance to be in Facebook's social groups.

Accenture employees all hire their spouses or friends. If you are not in their click you have no chance. Merit based promotions do not exist.

4.0,A corporation in tech clothing,"Be wary of the kool aid. It is a great place if you are fine with long hours and a review system that has been outpaced by growth. Typical days are filled with back to back meetings and it isn’t possible to keep work from overtaking personal time at home. The majority of time can easily be spent re-inventing the wheel due to constant change. Management is focused on metrics which doesn’t leave much time for their direct reports. Best advice for an IC is to be professional and keep your feelings out of it, you’ll do great if you don’t burn yourself out. Best advice for a manager is to roll with the “program”, show up early/stay late, and align with your leadership team. Email is the primary form of communication and tasking but there are a multitude of tools and groups that you need to utilize in order to keep pace with communications and workload. Be vigilant. If you are passionate about your work, this is not the ideal place but the perks/benefits/prestige are great.
The most enjoyable part of the job was being a part of something much larger than myself that was improving society.

The people were overwhelmingly pleasant, the benefits are phenomenal, and the work is rewarding if you're able to get into a role that fits you. It's going through some growth pains as far as people allocation, and the helter-skelter management culture supports that, but that's a product of the pace with which they work.

I worked there for two years. Expect to have a ridiculous schedule (some days 12-8 AM, some days 8-4 PM and some days 4-12 AM). As a contractor, you will be viewed as a second-class citizen. Your contracting agency will have little contact with you and your Manager will be a full-time employee, but they are not working for the same company so they can't help you with anything. Your contracting agency doesn't care about you because all they care about is the bottom line. They need warm bodies in seats reviewing content. That's all. There's thousands of people lined up behind you to take this ""prestigious"" job, so any complaints will be disregarded. ""You should just be happy to work here."" Everybody wants the golden egg ""FTE"" role so they won't make any waves to solve any problems you have. All of the administration staff for your contracting agency just wants to get promoted to FTE so they don't fix anything for fear of being a ""problem"" and all of your Facebook Managers are at the lowest level of FTE and they just want to get promoted to a better role so THEY won't fix anything for you.

4.0,Start-up Energy,"Oculus is a fantastic place to work; the community at Oculus is extremely passionate about products they/we develop and push to market. My colleagues and supervisor care deeply not just about the success of the collective team, but the success of each individual. It can occasionally be challenging to wait for the dust to settle before moving onto the next big endeavor, but folks are quick to learn.

A typical day would be arriving to the office between 8-9 a.m., and catching up on emails while eating breakfast/drinking coffee. After that, I generally task out my day, and begin grinding it out. Most of my colleagues are based in the bay area or LA, so much of my day is also spent collaborating/working with folks over video-conference. The culture of the office is laid back but respectful. Oculus has strong social good and diversity initiatives, and it makes me (and others, I presume) feel comfortable about bringing all of who I am to work each day.

The hardest part about the job is maintaining boundaries around work and life/family. Sometimes sacrifice is required, and sometimes, I've learned, it's okay to say no, or troubleshoot other options. While this was more of a challenge in my first couple of months, I have become better at listening to my own limits, and using my professional judgment to decide when I am able to give more.

The best part of my job is getting to use all of my experiences (from graduate school, social/personal experiences, personal interests, and beyond) to drive my passion for social good.

The office culture was AMAZING, but I believe that was due to the program we were in. It allowed things to be a little more relaxed. This is a call center environment.

I forged lasting friendships with this company due to the tight knit team environment, but again, this is a result of the specific program's atmosphere. I can't speak for other programs within the company as I only experience with one of them.

The HUGE downfall of working for Revana is that the programs come and go. While I was employed, I saw 2 programs (within a year) get laid off, and inevitably, our program as well. (despite performing with flying colors).
