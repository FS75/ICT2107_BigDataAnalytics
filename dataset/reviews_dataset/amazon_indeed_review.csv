3.0,Not a long term career I hoped,"I want to like the job but micromanagement is too much for me. Hard to enjoy the interactions with anyone up my reporting line because they want to ensure things are worded exactly how they want. I spend so much time on things that are barely read by sr leaders when presented it is unfortunate. That won’t ever change for any PM here.
Everyone on my level are enjoyable and sometimes others a level up are too but they must be on another team or department. Others on my direct team are seemingly worried about losing their job here. Very unfortunate. Creates more competitive atmosphere which is at odds with the PM role since it requires collaboration.
I think I can survive for a few more years and gain experience in this environment but what good will it do unless I end up in another similar environment. Let’s hope not.
The other issue is that those that joined more than 5 years ago will all be very much indoctrinated with the way things are and usually not want any massive changes to the culture or org structure. This is because they are thriving in it now, and if you want to change it, that is a threat. Wish I was making this up. So, work here and make some money and get your experience, but there are much better places to be a PM out there. I will eventually leave Amazon and that’s ultimately why the 3 stars.

5.0,Great place to work and advance in data center,"This company is 100% what you make it. If you don’t see a path forward for yourself you are always encouraged to change teams, or managers. There is no hand holding. I have been promoted twice and had three raises in 2022 alone, although promotion process is basically up to you to sell yourself. If you can’t provide data points let alone speak to why you deserve more money, you probably don’t deserve a raise.

Find yourself a manager who started out as a builder, not a manager with ZERO IT/data center experience who just got job bc of their bachelor degree.

3.0,A Tech business with very smart people led and managed by ammatures,"A place for builders and inventors but it has become an up or out culture. Your 3 month check-in survey will ask how many months (not years) do you plan to stay with Amazon? Pick from 3, 6, 9, 12, or 24. Most everyone who joins Amazon is very smart and has incredible experience to share with the community. Teams collaboratively tackling challenging problems can be an amazing and productive experience. The work is challenging and ambiguous due to striving to create growth through invention and investment in huge ""Blue Ocean"" opportunities that no-one has thought of yet. However, smart technical people do not always have the skills or understanding to be smart business people. This was exacerbated by the ""it's always Day 1"" culture that required even the simplest tasks to be ""re-discovered or re-invented"" by each new person on the team as formal process was shunned as ""Day 2 stagnation"". Advantages - easy pivot direction based on new information and ownership was pushed down to lowest possible decision maker. Disadvantages - very hard to capture best practices or lessons learned and common business practices had to be recreated every day/week/month without adding additional value. The leadership teams narrowly focus on skills and topic areas that got them into Amazon or were promoted for but many fail to expand their understanding or skills to fulfill the entirety of their responsibilities. Amazon is also a place where they practice forced ""un-regrettable attrition"" to reduce headcount. Positive performance reviews turn into negative reviews overnight and people are put -

The DSP managers are lowest you'll ever meet, they take from your money and treat you bad and only speak nice when they need you.

1.0,Read this with an open mind into an honest warning,Amazon is sooo boring hahahah. It's a horrible and boring environment. I come from a hardworking background and are also highly educated. I was there for economic reasons that led to financial hardships. The company is filled with specialness that I had rather give a job to homeless man or a highschool kid with no work ethic but a 4.0 GPA. This place is filled with uneducated people that will never amount to anything but a low 60k salary as somebody else's B locked away in a dungeon. It's a place for loving individuals from other countries that need a job and amazon will give it to them but the rest are just bums kids and people with business degrees that can't even analyze metrics.

And it can be easy to move up if you put your mind to it but I will not excuse the favoritism & selectively that goes on with management.

The computer tracks your rate and if there’s anything distracting you like new people, broken equipment, lack of supplies needed to do your job, even a bathroom break, it affects your rate. People who work hard and try their best don’t matter. There is a “flex” shift employee too who doesn’t have to watch their rate so they often stand around doing nothing and they get to keep their job. Amazon shovels in and shovels employees out.

The BENIFITS start day ONE and as long as you have PTO, or UPT you can leave early, show up late, and take days off when ever needed.

1.0,Decent money for grueling work. Not for a family oriented person,"Amazon has its perks, the benefits are unbeatable. The starting pay is also very enticing. However, what you are not told is that your breaks are 15 minutes, and your time starts as soon as you walk away from your station so in reality it’s a 5 minute break, 5 to walk to break room, 5 to rest, 5 to get back to your station. Your rates are outlandish, and though it’s positive make them, unless you are getting the right product you will potentially struggle and struggling leads to write ups. 3 wrote ups and your fired, no questions asked. Sick time is a joke, unless you are sick for a week (7days) you have to use time to be off. No doctors note will help you. Your manager will change often and frequently, and at times you’ll find yourself training them as they have no idea how to do what you do. If you are lucky enough to get a first shift position, keep it. After 5 years and multiple promotions I still had no opportunity to work 1st. If you have a family be prepared to either get very little to no sleep, or miss days sleeping . THIS JOB IS NOT FOR FAMILY ORIENTED PEOPLE!!!

When I was single and had no obligations to wife and kids this was a decent job, but once I had a family it became lost time with loved ones I will never get back and hard work wasted on management who will step all over you to meet there goals and leave you behind with nothing to show for your work.",,,"Warehouse Associate, Permanent Part-Time",Current Employee,"Boone County, KY","March 15, 2023"

4.0,"A good place to advance, if you're a good fit. It's a simple job for a decent wage, noncompetitive.","I enjoyed my time as a Fulfillment Center Associate. It was an easy job, a little mind numbing, but I felt mentally and physically good at the end of the day.
My coworkers ranged from great to awful; the interview process isn't really a filter, so you're going to be working with some real weirdos. The management was decent, no complaints, although they couldn't do much for you... except help you advance, which is something. I passed the bench interview in part because they were willing to work with me, although it was clear that many applicants never had a chance for consideration. Maybe the nature of the initial hiring process made it seem like they were obligated to an interview.
Overtime could be burdensome. PTO, VTO, and vacation weren't terrible, but it was made fairly clear that unless you work within that system there are no exceptions for time off outside of a leave of absence, which was given sparingly. The idea is that you leave and return when you can... but you obviously lose your benefits in the process.

1.0,A Broken System and stressful environment,"Directly at the Amazon Fresh Location in Manassas

At the start of the hiring process, we went from about 12 people to now 2 surviving. Been switched from paleo foods, to store center, to the challenges that is Inventory control. Our team shrank drastically in just less than a few months. And still were expected to reach out unrealistic task quotas. Last straw was finding out that day-time shift workers and even zone leads purposely mess up inventory to meet their own goals.

Management is too lost on a power trip that their only solution is searching for ""hardworking"" new hires to fill and replace rather than finding the core problems and solutions.

I take pride in my hard work ethic, but not when I'm constantly told I'm not fast enough, and constantly hearing our screaming radio to keep going faster.

I was only behind because I was responsible for constantly having to correct the most messed up Inventory store count I've seen in years, and it gets worse to terrible after a week from our bin audits from reasons I listed above.

Everyone that isn't a zone lead or in Management is absolutely miserable and are strongly trying to look elsewhere for other opportunities.

Funny how managers and zone lead supervisors can never go as fast as me without barely any errors or mistakes. Though they are the ones that idly talk and joke around more than the entire overnight staff combined, or what's left of it at this point.

Management is totally detached from employees but I do understand the hierarchy of a giant company like Amazon and I'm quite sure there's valid reasons but makes the work more difficult. The Ugly? The systems used are only as good as the proficiency of the person whom deployed them before you.

3.0,From an AM's POV,"Spent most of the day looking at numbers, coaching associates, and doing reports. Not super intensive once you learn the ways of Amazon. Site Leader never made sure the Ops Managers were on the same page, therefore the AMs were never on the same page causing each shift to run differently. This led to excessive complaints from AAs and rightfully so. My Ops Manager in particular never put much effort into my development. Yes, we're all there for a check essentially, but on the rare occasion that I asked her to do something they couldn't even follow through. All of our one-on-one conversations were pencil-whipped and never happened, and mechanisms for ""grading"" management are pretty much there for optics and aren't really monitored. So while this was an experience unique to me, proceed with caution.

I was a picker and you stood for 3 to 4 hours picking items. You have to go at a certain pace otherwise “management” comes up to you and basically threatens your job. I was working my hardest and still fell short to what they expected. I was drinking two energy drinks a night to keep up. Lunches are short. Takes ten hours to find a bathroom. Can’t listen to music.

Good software focused culture and processes help ensure all teams maintain a baseline level of best practices.

Be prepared to work very hard in some teams though. Even strictly 9AM-5/6AM teams can be extremely fast paced. New hires should expect a “sink or swim” environment. No real training period like some companies have and small/understaffed teams expect you to be a productive member very quickly.

Upper-upper crust of management is extremely out of touch with both lower corporate employees and the American public itself. This is shockingly obvious from internal communications and the small but telling decisions made by them that reveals their true outlook.

Amazon warehouse work is a challenge.

Amazon doesn't care about their employee's on any level. You are just a number. Amazon turns & burns so many employee's that 1 day they won't have anymore people applying to work there.

3.0,The work is unnecessarily painful,"I was a picker. As a picker, you must pull items from a 8ft pod with easily more then a hundred items inside. There are multiple pods that come to your station. You are to grab an item from the pod and put it on a bin. You or the system will determine if the bin has reached it's limit. You will push a button to complete the item transfer and forward the bin on to the next destination. Sound easy right? WRONG! You are required to go up and down a ladder consistent in order to reach top items and must squat sometimes all the way down on your knees for lower items. There will be heavy items that you will come across that may ruin your day if not lifted properly. You will not just be placing items in just one bin, there will be five and you will be filling them simultaneously and repeatedly throughout the shift. You can not sit at anytime at your station. You must move at all times. On top on the strenuous work, you will be timed and expected to move at a pace unreasonable for the human body. Especially for those working 12hr shifts. After a couple of months, I lost weight. My knees went bad, my legs began to swell, my blood pressure became harder to control and eventually the rest of my body gave out. So unless you want to be on muscle relaxants and pain killers for life, this is not a recommended career move. Before I left, the offered prize money for great ideas that may improve some aspect of the Company. I suggested they hire an ergonomics specialist to assist with restructuring the workstations so that they are not stressful on the human body, which will in turn increase",,,Amazon Fulfillment Associate,Former Employee,"Romulus, MI","March 11, 2023"

4.0,"My overall experience was very positive for nearly three years with the company, but in the end it became very stressful.","What is the best part of working at the company?
The leadership team for Disability and Leave Services is supportive and knowledgeable. The resources available to successfully execute my role were fantastic. The best part of working for Amazon were the teammates that I worked with. Amazon hires some of the most talented individuals that I have ever worked with. After nearly three years of working for Amazon those teammates have become friends. The ability to work remotely was a major benefit. My schedule was almost always a Monday thru Friday schedule. The focus on employee engagement was strong in my department in order to maintain a positive team environment. The medical benefits and all benefits were great. My input to problem solve and improve systems was always welcome by leadership. Customer focus was a top priority in serving other Amazonians.

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
The expectations and metrics for key performance indicators were not at all realistic. Those metrics are tracked daily, and you must meet or exceed those expectations to keep the job.

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?
It is difficult to explain what the culture was like at Amazon. The workers who I served as customers often would report they did not feel valued. It was easy to feel like a little fish in a gigantic Ocean. I heard peers say that we were all just a number to Sr. Leadership. I did not feel that way until the lay offs and cuts were being made to my direct team.

Management is not unbiased so a good degree of favoritism and misinterpretation so professional relationship will be tested.
The culture is ok not everyone is transparent or have reasonable interpersonal skills to be able to have a healthier environment.

Raises are only .50 cents every six months. It’s a very easy job but everyone at the warehouses can easily be overlooked and very under appreciated.

Turn over rate of managers. So many managers come and go but given more opnion and freedom than any one else, Un challenged. Most of the time l-1 are let go because of opinion rather that law or policy. Soo many labor laws violated. With no repercussions for the managers or company. Managers need to be held to the same standards as all other workers. HR never knows what's going on or what policy or laws are. Runs facility as if they was the CEO

WLB and benefits could be better. They aren't terrible, and if you can WFH the flexibility can kind of make up for it but there is definitely a sense of the company being cheap with the employees compared to other tech companies. For example, almost no free food (not even really snacks for some offices), majority stock vesting only really happens after year 3, 401k matching only happens starting on year 3, PTO still uses an accrual system and isn't nearly enough compared to other tech companies, very few holidays compared to the rest of tech.

Benefits: Amazon offers a comprehensive benefits package, including health, dental, and vision insurance, retirement plans, and employee discounts on Amazon products.

Compensation: Amazon is known for offering competitive compensation to its employees, including bonuses and stock options.
Innovation: Amazon is a company that values innovation and encourages its employees to think creatively and experiment with new ideas.
High-tech environment: Amazon is a technology-driven company, so its work environment can be exciting and fast-paced, with access to cutting-edge tools and technologies.
The Bad:

Intense work culture: Amazon is known for its intense work culture, with long hours, high-pressure workloads, and strict performance expectations.
Limited autonomy: Some employees have reported feeling like they have little autonomy in their work and that their job duties are heavily micromanaged.",,,ICQA Data Analyst,Former Employee,"Mansfield, OH","March 6, 2023"
4.0,Productive and easy work.,"Amazon gives a bunch of opportunities to grow in the workplace for sure. Whether it be to go and start school or to finish it! They train you and make sure you understand your job and willing to listen to your questions. Working with them will get you exhausted but that’s fine it’s like a free workout for only less than 5 days a week. No stressful situations or dealing with customers especially if you’re an introverted person. It gives you flexibility on doing things outside of work, like go to a dr’s appointment or watching your child’s game or event and even being able to take a vacation! It isn’t always for everyone considering the labor but you can always try it out and leave whenever you want to without having to do 1 or 2 week notices.

I like the job itself accountability in individual work ethics. The responsibility of work being done in a timely manner. Causes you to maintain and develop good working habits. This type job does not allow you time to not work!

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
Only stress is accounting for time loss and not making any productive value to Amazon. Keeping up with the fast work pace from the time you clock in to the end of your shift.

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?
Work environment is good there are a lot of benefits and incentives working for Amazon. They do a lot for the team everyday tips; exercise before shift, standup talks on safety, they supply your shoes, vests, gloves, safety glasses, first aid kits etc.

What is a typical day like for you at the company?
I come to work excited about being a part of a team. My shift starts greeting my co-workers at the time clock. We stretch sand exercise before any work starts. We also hear from management anything we should be aware of. Also discuss any concerns or issues any team member may have. We do discuss safety issues or accidents major or minor everyday.

We get an overall idea of how we are doing as a team. How we can improve getting packages out to better serve our customers.

The work itself I enjoyed doing as I like physically demanding jobs, however I did not like being asked to perform the job of three people while others are only able to do a third of their job and remain employed. Not only that, but those same individuals will be hired on, or given more and more contract extensions, over hard working employees if they happen to have been employed before you. There is no reason to work hard, just show up every day. The company doesnt value performance at all, in fact you will be penalized for it by being asked to do more and more until one day you are hurt or they just dont renew your contract.

3.0,"good job, but unrealistic safety measures","I've been a Transportation associate for 3+ years and have very much enjoyed it; Amazon paid for me to get my class-A CDL license which is very valuable to have. We operate yard trucks on the property to put trailers on/off dock doors, and with the CDL we are able to haul local loads within a 150 mile air radius.

Job is very low stress, and somewhat boring at times. Very easy job for the money, but you are just a number and easily replaced.
The safety rules continuously get more strict, and some are downright unrealistic. You are coached on how to drive trucks by managers who have never driven a truck.....makes no sense.

3.0,"Intense, but you can make it worth your while (for a short while)","@Fulfillment center/Warehouse -Find the good floor leaders and managers that are sensible and fair. They will help make your job easier, especially through all the drama, logistical chaos, and long shifts during peak seasons. Works best to lay out a mid-term and long-term plan of where you want to go next positionally or geographically within the company to advance yourself professionally and personally. If full-time, take advantage of the education award and use the health insurance, vision, and dental benefits to take care of your health, eyes, back (chiro), and rest of your body. Get plenty of rest before shifts. Remember, you are pretty much a warehouse athlete in some positions (10-12 hour shifts, 60,000+ steps in a single busy shift, etc.) If you don't have a plan while working at a fulfillment/warehouse center, don't stay there long enough to beat up your body detrimentally without an exit strategy. The wear and tear on your body in the long-term is not worth it.",,,Associate,Former Employee,"Spokane, WA","March 4, 2023"
2.0,No Real Chance of Advancement/Barely Any Raises/Robotic and Painfully Monotonous,"Been working at Amazon for over a year. During the first year I was on Water spider and Stow. Walked about 10 miles per day/lifting thousands of totes and boxes doing Water spider. I was doing the job of 2-3 people some days. I am a top performer in the company. Transferred to another facility. A random employee was aggressive towards me within my 2nd day shift there. The Management promotes new people and ignores the people who have been there longer. The job,(especially in stow),is monotonous, isolating and highly repetitive. Most employees leave feeling mentally drained by robotic, repetitive tasks that leave them time to do nothing but think as they have to work in complete silence. Then I found out that since I transferred from another facility I have to wait a year and a half to be eligible for a 10 cent raise. I'm actually paying more to live where I transferred to! This job enhances anxiety and depression. The pay is not keeping up with inflation but it's still better than some other warehouses pay and there are some decent benefits. Most Amazon facilities are in the middle of nowhere which creates travel time issues for workers. Also ,it feels like a prison setting as there are only windows at the front entrance and breakrooms. The average Amazon employee stays at Amazon for about 8-9 months. The brainpower required for this job is practically Nil and you learn just how materialistic people are and how much stuff people buy that they don't actually need while doing this job.",,,Amazon Warehouse Associate,Current Employee,"Ottawa, ON","March 4, 2023"

You have to work like a fast machine, if you do not work fast work for them, they will calculate every steps by very high performance computer programs. You do not have normal breaks. If you go to the breaks or toilet, the manager will call you angrily. I saw all the time employer’s coordinators contact you for speeding up your job.

4.0,Overall decent place to work,They were a decent place to work at least when it was a work from home position. I'm not entirely sure I would have commuted to the actual call center for the pay they offered. Decent benefits. Most co workers were great. Management is a bit overwhelmed and clueless no one to really reach out to in a crisis. I once went 3 full days before my manager responded to my urgent chimes and email so that's fun.

1.0,Poor management! Okay pay and good benefits,"Management is horrible, benefits are good and pay could be better for the amount of work you have to do. Going “ above and beyond “ gets you no where and to much favoritism. Extremely qualified/hard workers get overlooked for promotions and they get taken advantage of by management because they are hard workers.

Also, the HR dept is useless they will tell you to call the ERC (Employment Resource Center) and ERC will tell you just to contact your HR dept. Also at the FC location here in Omaha, you are not allowed to use the elevator unless you can get an accommodation note from your doctor.

1.0,Over worked,"If you work as a manager in operations expect a ""10 hour shift"" to really be a 12-14 hour shift. This des not count any ""projects"" you have to do if you want to get promoted to the next level.
Being good at your job does not necessarily mean you will get a promotion. It seemed that the only thing that mattered was the extracurricular things that you did. After putting 48 - 56 hour weeks (no overtime pay) putting more time toward Amazon on my days off were simply not worth it. Also, if you do manage to get promoted, it does not get better. You still put in the same amount of hours but the size and scale of your projects get bigger. Also you will get paid drastically less than an external hire at the same level. I was an external hire and felt bad for people that were doing the job the same I was doing for over a year, making 20% less than me.
This is a great job if you are single and don't really have a social life and you are looking for something fast pace that makes good money.",,,Operations Manager II,Former Employee,"Staten Island, NY","March 3, 2023"

We got paid every Friday. We could get overtime if we sign up for it.

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
The supervisor treated us like kids. They times us going to the restroom. They timed us getting to our machines when we walked in the door. Especially when we have to come from the first floor to third or floor and if you don’t get there on time you will get a right up. I’m fifty years old I can’t get up four flight of stairs in five minutes . So they try to write me up.

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?
It is hot and muggy in there. We use to supply water bottles but they stop. Now we have water fountain with cups. We have people in here falling out a lot for over heating.

You can get paid daily (if you opt for it) and you won't need a gym membership cuz you do a lot of walking there depending on what position you do and where you are stationed but you can move up or learn a new skill there too. They also have inclusion too.

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
They have quotas and if you don't keep up, they can fire you for that.

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?
They are interested in quantity and big on safety and reducing or eliminating injury. Culture is unsatisfactory for me. Not saying why.

1.0,Just find something else,"Working for a job that kind of well seems worth ut but it's not always the case. Being overworked, underappreciated, and constantly bossed around can make it difficult to enjoy the actual job. Many people find themselves struggling when they work in such an environment: feet hurt, back pain, being yelled at. When you can barely take a 10-minute break or have any freedom to rest, it can be tough to recharge your batteries and perform at your best. Management can often feel like they're ruling the world, making it challenging to voice concerns or make changes. Ultimately, a job that pays well but offers little else can leave you feeling drained and unsatisfied.

To many company rear end kissing managers and safety people constantly harping on you for all of Amazons ridiculous so called safety protocols.

Clock in work like a mule until break have to be back specifically after 30 minutes so using the washroom and eating has to be done in that timeline. They check your time card through their laptops so if you are not working right after the 30 minutes they take note of that.

2.0,Mentally exhausting,"I worked at Amazon for 3 years. I was trained in stow, pick, decant, outbound dock, pack, and also problem solved for a little bit. The main problem with amazon is the management and the higher ups. There are little to no managers that have ever done the work of a warehouse Associate. Due to Amazon's high turnover rate they would rather hire people straight out of college than treat their employees good and hire from within. I went through 4 different managers in my first year, and the last one just graduated from college and had never even had a job before. I'm not sure how they thought that would work out but that's amazon for you. Everyday you come in and go to your department. 99% of the time they will be overstaffed and offer you voluntary time off with no pay, or they will send you to another department with no training and just expect you to figure it out. You are also tracked for everything you do. The bottom 5% of rates get written up every week and it is automatically generated. That meaning that if you encountered a problem that caused your rate to fall that wasn't necessarily your fault, you get written up with no chance to explain why. The goal rate is based on a assumed mix of 60% small items and 40% large. Small items are faster to work, but you never have small items so you are in constant fear of your rate being low even though there is nothing you can do about it. Everyone that is working is always in a poopy mood due to the work environment. In 3 years I made no friends at all at Amazon because you don't really have to time to get to know your Co workers.",,,Warehouse Associate,Former Employee,"Tulsa, OK","March 1, 2023"

You can also easily swap a day or night you want to work if needed.
Amazon does offer a load of benefits, but they seem too complicated to use and to know how much they are a benefit!

Shifts are 10 hours long and on your feet all the time, with 2 breaks about half an hour. Can be tiring. Forced to work at a fast pace and on higher levels it can feel a toxic atmosphere, but on a basic level as an associate it feels OK to just do your job, get paid and go home, unless they are saying you are too low.

4.0,Was Super Flexible,"I worked as a shopper inside a Wholefoods. For the most part it was a super flexible job. But over time, some policies changed and made it not so great. I started in summer of 2020 and they were hiring like crazy. You could work as little as 3,
4 hour shifts a month. But then they changed it to minimum of one 4 hour shift per week minimum. And then things started changing again. Forever changing rules, etc.

This must have been due to the job centering around the pandemic(at least when I started working there) and when the pandemic started to die down, things changed.


But still overall the most flexible, laid back job Ive ever had. Kinda felt like you were your own boss. But I had to leave for peer related reasons at my site though I would have stayed a little longer otherwise.

1.0,Terrible pay for the amount effort required,"Working at a Sortation Centre, the pay is very low compared to similar warehouse jobs and the work is tiring. Job security is poor, Amazon treats ""associates"" as a number and so many talented people slip through their fingers because of their stingy hiring practices. Managers buy takeaways for themselves on the company credit card and constantly give away pointless tat instead of putting up wages. Mandatory overtime is deployed during busy periods but you will be constantly harassed to take ""Voluntary Time Off"" during quiet times.

3.0,Good place to work at,"If you’re a blue batch associate, you have all their benefits while white batch associates have limited benefits. I mean it makes sense, however I think it’s not fair when it comes to bereavement. White batch associates don’t get to use bereavement until you’re converted to a blue batch associate. You have to use your own hours (PTO, UPT) or you get deducted points on your schedule.

1.0,Amazon is not worth the stress nor lack of family time.,"What is the best part of working at the company?
Staff. Management is horrible. Management literally tells you to NOT care about your self or family. They don’t care if you have debilitating migraines or seizures. Amazon does NOT have a disability policy. Amazon WILL over-work you and NOT care! Horrible with their time, HR is a joke!

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
Everything! Management is horrible! Other staff will be in your ideas and personal life. No one respects privacy. Managers WILL tell your private life to regular associates AND EXPECT YOU WILL BE TAUNTED OVER IT! People will pick fights with you.

1.0,Horrible,"Came in thinking it’d be a straight forward warehouse job but it isn’t. You’ll proceed to be trained by idiots with no real leadership skills that lean on bad habit forming, that glare at cameras all day! Good luck trying to stand out here because you’ll be capped by a shrimp who thinks you’re tired. They preach the fact that your movements are traced, felt no real job security throughout my zombie horde like experience. At this point I’m worried about my biometrics being stowed somewhere. Terrible lower management, that gets sleepy when they hear you volunteered to work extra hours through automated text. I come from very strenuous and faced paced work environments, with lack of upper management belief in the overall job diminishes the will to perform at your best because you’ll just be quizzed on random acronyms once you’ve hit 1000 pieces or so by a depressing, lazy and favoritized work environment. Don’t worry about the swab. Was trolled during my training due to a tolerance break. Was lowballed on my initial pay rate upon I9 verification. Not actually 16.60 but maybe if you add in the massive amount of expensive vending machine items.

-ALL DAY Workout. On your feet with Steel Toe shoes for 8 hours.
-Very little pay.
-VTO (Voluntary Time Off) associates are encouraged to go home early and give up hours/pay to meet profit margin.
-If you work faster and more effectively, your pay stays the same and you are expected to help slower associates.
-No support from management, you are a number.

Pros:
Health insurance included.
Easy to request time off on App.
College tuition paid for.
No interview.",,,Seasonal Associate,Former Employee,"Los Angeles, CA","February 24, 2023"

Hundreds of programs and resources available to employees. It's pretty amazing the help that is available. They have discount programs, mental health resources, traveler rewards, rental assistance, the list goes on. The only reason I'm not working there anymore is because I moved two hours away from the site I was at and it seems to be the only location that offers the flex schedule. With flex schedule I was able to choose the days and shifts I worked. These spots are rarely open so it was a blessing to get the position at that time. I worked in Customer Returns. I went to work, did my job and no one bothered me. I have worked at another location and this was not the case. I was not as pleased working there. But the Jefferson location is great.

1.0,"Good pay, great benefits, a lot of BS","Fast paced work area at the expense of their employees. Physical injury from repetitive lifting, twisting, turning, reaching, gripping. Every thing is numbers based, on how many items an hour you can do. Each area has different number requirements, and if you are in the lower 5%, a computer writes you up, therefore pushing an employee to work even harder and faster.

You only work 10 hour shifts in most states. You get benefits day 1. Some people like that you get 80 plus hours of unpaid time you can use whenever (though I never use it).

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?
Workers aspiring to move up and being offered opportunities without a pay raise. Just to watch others who are brought in that do not know what they are doing ti manage those who have worked to move up.

What is a typical day like for you at the company?
Drag yourself into a job you do not want to do. Start working, get pulled over to discuss a quality error. Get back to work repeating the same task over and over. Talk about rate. Justify hurrying as a possible chance to move up, or get a raise. Go to break. Come back and listen to a manager’s ego talk. Hear about whatever the site director is pushing through managers. After that motivational moment go back to repeating a task over and over. Go on another break.

3.0,Not an encouraging place,"Overall, it was passable but miserable. The pay was fine, compensation is ok, insurances were cheap etc.

Leadership was awful, nepotism ran rampant. Highly unprofessional. Worst HR experience of my life. Was openly told on numerous occasions that I was expendable. Management played favorites despite levels of effort or work accomplished. The higher Management continually made unnecessary changes to systems that worked in the building for bonuses which made multiple tasks unbearable to do. Folks typically were incredibly rude outside of a few. The breaks were 15 minutes despite taking around 10 minutes to go to the break room and you would be scolded for taking your full break.","Insurance, pay, compensation","Short breaks, unprofessional environment, poor leadership",Amazon Associate,Former Employee,"Horn Lake, MS","February 22, 2023"

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
When nobody was home having to go back and the guy would make it go like right back so he's not going to be anybody there they're at work this is ridiculous just wasting my time... And the way they did the Boston packages around the colleges I was going back and forth to the same places why weren't they bunch together that was horrible

2.0,Avoid working here,"Amazon is not a company for work/life balance, you are there and they got you.

4.0,Great job if you do the work,"The job is super simple though many complain only because they don't want to work. Biggest fault would be communication between management. The PAs are honestly your go to people to get anything done or just to receive answers or support, amazing people but underpaid for what they do. Your AMs and OMs main priority is numbers and getting people wrote up. Benefits are amazing and the amount of upt, pto and vacation time you get is amazing.

2.0,Poor place to work,"You are over worked and underpaid for what you do. I am a operations supervisor but expected to do a supervisor's job, health and safety, HR, RME and security all on a operations pay (which is the lowest out of the lot).

I felt as though maybe they were trying to hard to seem as though they looked at you/are using you as a number than a soul. It is easy to learn new skills (its all super easy work) as long as they (management) are able to or remember to add you to list to be cross trained. From my experience and what others have mentioned to me. Not a horrible place to work especially with the benefits, but at the end of day, it is a multi-million if not billion $$ corp.

5.0,Product and fun workplace,"Nice place to work at, there is nice management and they always are willing to help you progress and learn better. Career advancement is a bit tricky because you need to be working there an x amount of time before you can grow but the leadership is always ready to help with that.

2.0,Overwork and underpaid,"The management will assign you many tasks, with long hours and little compensation. There have also been reports of poor working conditions, including inadequate break times and unsafe warehouse conditions. Some workers have complained about feeling like they are treated more like robots than human beings, with strict productivity quotas and little room for error.

Additionally, there have been reports of a high turnover rate and a lack of job security, with some employees feeling like they are easily replaceable and undervalued by the company. These factors, combined with a demanding and often physically exhausting job, can lead to low morale and high stress levels among Amazon.com employees in the logistics industry.",,,Process Assistance & Ambassador,Former Employee,"Vancouver, BC","February 22, 2023"
2.0,Brutal,"At the end of the day, its all about money, so people suck it up and do the job, but man, its brutal, especially if you work night shift.

3.0,Work here if you need a stepping stone,"This job is one of those where you work it until you can’t anymore. They work you to death, you don’t get holidays, the pay doesn’t match the labor, and you’re heavily micromanaged. I was a stower and a problem solver. Management is great depending where you’re working in the building/who you’re working with. On the other hand, management could be trash like I experienced. Amazon offers four or five different kinds of time you can take off. Some paid, the rest unpaid. During orientation I took a lot of notes, I highly recommend doing so, because they like to switch things up on people, especially with the sign on bonus—good luck getting that. If you do work for them they don’t test for weed, just hard drugs (which I hope you don’t do to begin with). Everyone gets in honestly, but you barely get a break. While they do have allotted times for break, your spot for it better be close. If it isn’t I promise you’ll spend 60% of your break speed walking to and from your break area. You have to clock out at a station that isn’t close, then go eat or nap and be st your station the SECOND your break is over ready to get back in the routine. Good luck man. Six months was pushing it for me. The premiums made it worth it until I had what I needed/couldn’t take it anymore.",,,Warehouse Associate,Former Employee,"Pontiac, MI","February 21, 2023"

3.0,Not what expected,Many of the leadership treat the employees like numbers. Most of the learning ambassadors are very unprofessional and not helpful at all.

1.0,Stay away,I strongly recommend people to stay away. I had to pay £230 a week for the van hire. The management was poor and only interested in one thing delivering the parcel at all costs. You will get added to a group chat and you will only get told the night before if you have a route for the next day meaning you cannot plan anything as you will not know when your days off are.

1.0,Worked 3 weeks didn’t like the position.,I worked briefly for Amazon as a seasonal associate. The position I was assigned was picker. I tried another role of cart pusher and also stacked trays at each station. However the training manager who had ideas of his own thinks being a picker was his way. I disliked the picker position because I wasn’t aware what I was getting into with Amazon. I wanted to originally be in loss prevention because I was good at Security with a major company that was not the Amazon vendor. Never was allowed to work in it. I would say picker is a job for someone who literally wants a disability retirement and never get enough sleep.,,,Warehouse Picker,Former Employee,"Haslet, TX","February 20, 2023"

Tell you if you have issues you can talk to them, I did and got in trouble for it. HR does not know how to do its job properly. No chance of growth at all.

Work was simple enough, help out drivers with problems, sort boxes and bags, then repeat. Depending on your manager, they can be relaxed or hovering over your shoulder.

3.0,"Physically (and emotionally) demanding, but straightforward and simple","I worked here for 2 months and only in my final weeks did my feet start to not kill me. I left work every day covered in grime and bruises and in pain. If I didn't have copious amounts of pain killers on hand I wouldn't have survived any of the days. You are on your feet and in constant motion, the only rest time being the 30 minute lunch time and two 15 minute breaks. By the final 3 hours of every shift I was mentally begging God to end my suffering despite being completely non-religious. Despite all this, honestly not a terrible place to work. It's impossible to do anything those 4 days after work because you're too exhausted, but the 3 days off in a row were pretty nice. The people there were generally pretty chill, and all the managers were kind and understanding. Good for both people who like to work silently on their own and who like to causally converse, with the different roles you can be assigned in a day allowing for either. Also great if you don't want to go to the gym, this job serves as an intense 10 hour work out a day. If you like strong structure, clear responsibility, and the ability to mind your own business independently most of the day. To be honest as well, this job is great for neurodivergent people and attracts a lot of autistic people, so as someone on the spectrum I felt right at home here.

3.0,Be prepared to lift heavy boxes,"I was surprised when I started working here that women would be doing most of the heavy lifting. Management would often put like 10 women, maybe one man in the most heaviest lifting section, and all of us were worried about injury. And I would see big strong men scanning envelopes.
This heavy, constant, non-stop lifting bothered my wrist.

3.0,Work Atmosphere,"Often in my department, managers are cliquish; if you aren't in the clique or they don't like you, you could potentially be overlooked or mistreated. A lack of utilization of valuable skills in the team is compounded by favoritism for managers' friends.

5.0,Great benefits,"Amazon has an excellent benefits package and they are generous with giving you time off if you need it (granted, if you run out of your 40 hrs PTO every year then it is unpaid time). It's great because you don't have to ""call in"" if you are sick you just request time off with the employee app. The work can get boring sometimes but it is nothing too outrageous. Sometimes they get on you about rates but as long as you do your job the rate won't matter because you will meet it. Breaks are too short considering how far the break areas are from the work stations. Moving up can sometimes be hard if your resume doesn't ""look good"" to the computer that scans it. I would still recommend the job though.",,,Warehouse Associate,Current Employee,"Tucson, AZ","February 19, 2023"

Amazon was amazing. I enjoyed having a front row seat as the company evolved weekly in front of me

2.0,Amazon is full of diversity. This is one of the thing I like about amazon.,"Amazon has amazing benefits. This is one asset that is very helpful for people. Second, Amazon is full of diversity. I like that factor. Third, the communication at Amazon is terrible. Many Leaders in Operations,and Human resources do not know how to encourage, motivate or communicate with there employees. There is also a lot of favoritism. Hard work is not valued. Trying to get a promotion is difficult, depending on who you know. Over All, Amazon is a great place to work and grow.

Come to work and not having a bad week? You’ll probably get fired. Literally the place is a revolving door where basically the one’s who work the hardest aren’t getting promoted to management. It took me almost 4 years to get promoted and that was after I expressed I would quit. Instead of promoting me at the building I was at to begin with, they sent me to a different building because I got black listed from being a manager at the first building due to me telling my operation manager no to him asking me to walk associates to HR for him to fire them. I said I was uncomfortable with doing that, he said well you can’t be a manager and literally told me he will deny my promotion as long as he is there.",The pay is the only pro,Everything else is a con.

4.0,Best Job I ever had,"I learned how to work in multiple areas, Working in a Amazon sortation center is probably the easiest warehouse you'll ever work in. Only problem is if you had two shifts in one day and it was slow they will flex down 1 hour each shift. For example if your normal shifts were 10am-2pm and 3:30pm-7:30pm and if it was a slow day it will become 10am -1pm and 3:30pm-6:30pm meaning you'll have a huge break between both shifts which I didn't like.",,,Amazon Warehouse Associate (mdt5),Former Employee,"Lewisberry, PA","February 17, 2023"

Work is very demanding and management in many areas within Technology are tough. So expect stress and less work-life balance, even though company on the whole is promoting it and is much better on the business side.

However if you successfully complete a performance plan then you are good to go.

4.0,Good place to start career,"Looking back, I wish that I stayed at Amazon longer than I did. It’s a good place to start working at. The interview is easy, because it’s just a drug check and background check. Also some of the people there were pretty cool. It was easy to get along with the supervisors. PTO and time off are easy to take and it gets added every quarter. On holidays employees get off early. In addition, they help pay for college tuition and offer multiple benefits. Also, if you quit, they will probably rehire you.
However, working at Amazon also has its cons. Work days can go by slowly depending on your role. During peak season employees work longer days, sometimes 12 hours. Also there was this one snitch, and some of the workers gossip.
Overall, Amazon is a great place to work for. They offer good benefits. The PTO and time off is easy to take. I would recommend this job to anyone who can lift 40 pounds or more and stand for the full 8 hours.

The pay is far too low for the work expectations, there's no communication whatsoever so it's always messed up every single day, HR is two different jokes in different locations that just refer you back and forth to each other so nothing ever gets fixed, and then they fire you for their mistake that they refused to take action on.",,,Packer,Former Employee,"Huntsville, AL","February 16, 2023"

Apply. Get in trouble for doing your work well. You're not getting recognition. You're another number that punches in and works for 10 hours. If you're a female you have it the easiest.

3.0,Ok place to work,"It is an ok place to work. We worked from home for 2 years due to Covid, and then everyone was forced back into the office, or you'll get fired.
There is a lot of micromanagement going on, where they would walk around looking to see what you're doing all the time. It is annoying.
Management would change your schedule out of nowhere while you've been employed for some time. For example, if you chose to start at 7am, they changed it to 6:30am without consulting you. Other people had it worse, they would start at about 1am and got moved to 6:30am without accommodation.
Employees have expressed that they would love to return to WFH, but do not, instead pizza is supposed to be motivating.
Management has added on more responsibilities without a reasonable pay increase. I am currently doing 3 times more work than when I started and have barely gone up in my wages.

It’s hard for them to admit fault when something is going on with their computer. They just blame your internet . Then you have to use time off for that as well. You use time off for everything.

5.0,Productive and Fun Workplace,"As a former Amazon warehouse worker, I can say with certainty that the job is an absolute nightmare. The work is physically grueling and the pace is unrelenting. You're expected to move quickly and efficiently, often without sufficient breaks or time to rest. The company's focus on productivity over employee well-being is evident in the punishing workloads and unrealistic targets. The management is harsh and unforgiving, and there's a constant feeling of being watched and evaluated. The pay is low, and the hours are long and irregular, making it difficult to plan your life outside of work. The company's commitment to meeting customer demand at any cost has created an environment that is toxic and dehumanizing. Overall, Amazon treats its workers as expendable cogs in a massive, profit-driven machine.

3.0,Very stressful and sometimes rude staff,"Working at Amazon sortation centers can be a challenging experience due to long hours, a stressful environment, and rude staff. The fast-paced work environment, high expectations and tight deadlines can put a lot of pressure on employees.

One of the main complaints among employees is the long hours. The company is known for requiring employees to work long shifts, often 10 hours or more, which can be physically and mentally exhausting. In addition, the fast pace of the work and the high volume of packages that need to be sorted can make for a high-stress environment.

Another issue that employees face is the behavior of some of the staff, including management. Some workers report rude and dismissive treatment from supervisors, which can make for a hostile work environment. This can be especially difficult for those who are new to the job or who are already feeling overwhelmed by the pace of work.

Overall, working at Amazon sortation centers can be a demanding and challenging experience. While the company is known for offering competitive pay and benefits, the long hours, stressful environment, and rude staff can make it a difficult place to work. However, it is important to note that everyone's experience may differ, and some employees may have had positive experiences working at Amazon.",,,amazon sortation operative,Former Employee,"Sparkhill, West Midlands","February 13, 2023"

They do not care about you. The only reason why they help people promote is for their own resume with amazon because they will force you up the latter and they force management to do so. Its a backstabbing company where you think you may be able to trust people but in the end they are in it only for their own gain. If you have kids or a family DO NOT WORK HERE!!!

The lunch times and clocking out

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
Not having adequate rest periods between cage changes

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?
Overall answer is you work without expressing your concerns. If there’s a problem ignore it so production doesn’t go down.

What is a typical day like for you at the company?
Clock in, stretch for 10 mins, start up pit machine and get first item scanned within the first 7 mins post huddle, last item scanned and put away 5mins before breaks and click out time.",,,Inventory Associate,Former Employee,"Shelby Township, MI","February 8, 2023"

2.0,Not a good place for safety professionals.,"At KCVG:

Typical day:

Standard work: which is numerous and tedious but not insurmountable.
Investigations: Most sites in amazon safety personnel write and analyze. Here they did not, the ability to make meaningful change as a specialist is close to 0. Kowtow to ops at every turn even when safety is involved.

Launch and policies: Management threw us to the wolves and expected us to do well. Even if we did well on policies there was really no recognition.

Culture: Bad. Firings with no management support, a culture of encouraged (either tacitly or explicitly) cutthroat behaviors, huge disconnect between safety personnel and management. Management held an air of ""we're better than you"" that never went away. Many colleagues broke down at work (sobbing).

Pay: Horrendous. Bottom 7% for safety professionals. Explained away by ""performance raises"" which were inconsistent and inadequate.

Hardest part: culture
Best Part: Lunch.",,,Safety Specialist,Former Employee,"Hebron, KY","February 8, 2023"

3.0,Workaholics Dream Turned Nightmare,"This company has been both the best place I could have gone to grow and challenge myself and the most unhealthy place I could have chosen to work. I have had some really amazing opportunities, but this company will take and take without any reciprocation. As a salaried leader, I have worked well over 70 hours a week and changed my schedule on a whim dozens of times. There are some sites that will be very supportive of work life balance, but over the culture is one that if you do not go well above and beyond and work at the next level for months without compensation, you will never get ahead. Even then it is very focused on the metrics, meaning bad people managers will be promoted even if there are significant behavioral issues. That's not to say every leader I have had has been been bad, I have had a few that have changed my life in the best ways, but there is simply not enough development for leaders so that they can be taught soft skills and people management. Overall, if someone can come into the right site, they will have a great experience, but with each site acting as its own little company with its own rules and norms, there is a lot of room for bad managers and behaviors to thrive.",,,Salaried Manager,Current Employee,Kentucky,"February 8, 2023"

2.0,"Great coworkers, terrible procedures","Maybe it depends on where you work (HGR2) for me, but unless you make use of Amazons extra benefits it’s not that great of a place to work for policy wise. The upper management really don’t help much, unless it’s safety related. Which is honestly more micromanaging than anything. Common sense should prevail in the majority of cases, but legality issues I’m sure can be more of a concern. Though I can’t be too surprised considering they never actually interview you, you’re just hired and have your start date as long as you pass drug and COVID tests. The pay is decent, the shifts are okay considering how long they are. The HR team is pretty much glorified time clocks. The way they set up their PTO, UPT and vacation time is ridiculous. You tend to use a whole hour of unpaid time or a just a quite a few minutes of the little PAID time off you do get to cover being late. So your PTO is paying you for the time you would’ve been at work and maybe miss stand up, Psychologically of course you think losing a few minutes of that would couldn’t hurt. Then it just keeps lowering your little paid time off. Which might not be so bad again but with the long hours you work it hardly helps with the little time you get off. I mean it’s smart on their part, especially when holidays roll around and you get time off for working the holiday, you know just not enough to actually cover a shift, especially if you work over night. The people around you tend to be amazing though. It’s really less about doing your best for Amazon’s as much as you’re doing it for your coworkers.

3.0,Great Pay,"I started off as a seasonal employee for the Christmas season. It was a four-hour shift. It started off great and then a coworker threw a package at me. I don't know if they deal with conflicts since we were seasonal. After that, I went full-time.. They have a thing called a stow rate which to me was unrealistic. It was 330 packages per hour.. scan 5-6 packages per minute. But it's impossible when people start the totes unorganized and by the time, there are 5-7 packages in the totes.. it is impossible to fit more unless you organize it. which you couldn't spend much time organizing cause your rate will go down... I had a lot of good managers but there was two managers who were on power trips.

Coming from seasonal (4hr shift) to full-time was messy... they didn't tell me when my last break was. the 10hr shift gets three breaks.. A 15min, 30min and another 15min. 10 hr shift kinda feels like a 6hr shift to me.

1.0,Very Stressful Work Enviornment,"I have been at Amazon Fulfillment Center since May 2022. At first I liked the position and am working as a flex employee choosing my hours as I am retired and collecting my social security benefits. After seven months at this job I have felt frustrated at the overall work environment plus Amazons policies. The pay is not up to par for the work expected. Being part time there are no benefits except I signed up for the 401k plan. The policies alone are stressful and management pushes for expected work flow and to reach their goals. I previously worked at Amazons sort center on 2020 and it is no different. I ended up quitting after eight months there. I have decided to try to find another part time job and get out of the factory job environment.

4.0,Good place to work,"I know everyone always has something bad to say when hard work is involved but as far as warehouse work goes, Amazon is definitely a good place to work. The pay is above most other warehouse jobs and the benefits are great! Yeah they expect that you work while your on the clock and they expect you to do the work correctly and efficiently. Which is really not that hard….I’m a woman in my mid 30’s with three school aged children who worked a graveyard shift at Amazon, if I can do that and juggle all the things that come with raising a family then anyone can do it if you have even a decent work ethic. The only thing that I think is a little much is the mandatory overtime that Amazon is know for during busy times. When already working 4 10 hr days in a labor intensive job, there should never be more then one mandatory overtime day. That to me, is taking advantage of their employees.

Favoritism to the fullest! That’s all I can say

A typical day for me involves getting myself mentally and physically prepared to be in an environment that is so toxic for 10 hours.

Which is why I deal with the doodoo other than that the rest of the day, I try my best to drift off and pretend I’m somewhere else other than Amazon and even then there’s a lot of people that tend to get in the way of that.

If you work at an SSD (Sub same day) warehouse, it's way better and the people are more enthusiastic.

You get paid every week and benefits are good. The only bad things is management is sometimes bad or good (depending on your department) They are sometimes inconsistent with things and also you WILL see favoritism. Opportunity to moving up in the company is based on tenure and your work ethic (again favoritism can move you up much quicker).

3.0,"Mturk is good for small cash, but don't relie on it.","Amazon Mechanical is good for small cash, but don't relie on it.

I've worked there since about 2016 and I've completed over 1,000 tasks, from these tasks I've earned about $1,000, but no where near above $2000.

Some of the tasks can be short and fun and usually pay about a cent or a nickle.

Other tasks that pay about 1 or 5 dollars can take much longer, some taking about 2 hours.

They send direct deposit every 3 days.

Also, if someone doesn't approve your work, your score goes down which can lead to less work opportunities.

The pay isn't easy nor fast, I average about $2 dollars a day and that takes about an hour or two, or more.

Of you need a little change then Mturk is an excellent source, however if you're looking to earn a salary of $10,000 a year, this is going to take about 50 hours a week of your time to reach that $10k a year goal.

IT SUCKED, even more so when you ally get to the counter and the not so friendly associate tells you something that adds to the already inconvenienced process. Well Amazon has created a process that eliminates all the xyz's and replaced em with ABC's. Literally, you use a scanner to do 3 scans...and the customers return is complete. Its easy as ABC... for both the customer and the staff. Amazon streamlined the process right in The APP or Amazon.com, where the shopping is so simple, the return process is just as easy. Your work day has been created with simplicity in mind. Everyone has an equal amount of responsibility and no one is ever left with someone else's load. Communication is also always there so no one is ever left not knowing what to do.

But as you can imagine, it is a VERY physical job and so after awhile it can be very draining mentally and physically. Occasionally you will get lucky and be able to leave early or have VTO but if not, you can become very drained, very quickly and question if it's still worth it.

2.0,Means to an end,"If you land a job driving for Amazon, it will be through a private transport company contracted to them. Each company has it's own policies and pay rate, so it is hit or miss whether you will be banking or struggling. Hours are usually 10+ three or four days a week, and those days are often not together. Limited opportunities for overtime and only during peak season. You will drive among insane people who shouldn't be on the road and be expected to deliver anywhere from 200-500 packages a day. They will tell you it's fine to bring packages back as long as you drive safely and then lecture you when you do. Vans are not cleaned like they should be and it's not uncommon to find bottles of urine and leftover food in them. Many unsafe mechanical issues that take weeks of complaining for them to be fixed. Expect to maintain good cardio as you will climb in and out of a van a hundred or more times a day, traverse triple flights of stairs, or climb steep inclines while carrying heavy packages as the vans will not make it up. If you suffer an injury or become sick it will be held against you. Doctors notes are not accepted. When you are hired they will tout block pay for 10 hours so you can complete a route in 5 and go home early while being paid. In actuality if you finish early you are expected to go help someone else finish too less you want to be terminated. If you are working in the city your stops will consist of apartments and condos that are 20 stops door to door, but only given the time of a single stop to do them.

Work is very simple, but made difficult do due to the load. During covid, supervisors only allowed 1 person to unload a full truck by themselves. During peak seasons, diverters and runners were always flooded with packages to the point they fall over to the ground, stacking high up to your waste. Stowers always were twisting and bending their backs to quickly stow packages so they won't be harassed by supervisors. And yes, they do monitor stow rate. There is a lot more I could list, but you get the idea.

I and many others were not treated fairly and those who were close to people in power got positions that are nice and effortless.

Cons: 10 hrs shifts, boredom, every week your body will feel terrible and if you are a good worker actually making good numbers, management will harass you. Upper management will send the operational people to basically interrupt what you are doing to talk about “numbers” like if I cared. They interrupted me 4 times in just to days to pressure me to be quicker when everyday we will finish way before scheduled time. The reason is because they want the employees making good numbers to pick up the lack of others. In addition to that, they LOVE to send people home early, be understaffed and then make you do 4 people’s job. The graveyard shift, harassment, low pay and prison feel like is not worth it.

Peak is gruelling and if you are a little off colour it can feel like the days are brutally long. Usually plenty of overtime at Peak and you can really boost your earnings. Usual work patterns are 4x10 hours days/nights. Having 3 days off would be better if you could get at least one weekend day off.
It would get more positive feedback if the pay was a bit better and hard work rewarded with a permanent contract. Sadly you are not guaranteed a permanent contract no matter what, so be prepared to be told your contract will not be extended.",,,Fulfilment Centre Associate,Former Employee,Manchester,"January 28, 2023"

These people asked multiple staff,hr, and anyone possible if they would be made full time and regular employees. Each person asked was told Amazon never let's seasonal people go if they want to stay it's only a matter if time until they are permanent employees. False it was only a matter of time until each of those people who asked daily because their family's depended on a paycheck and these jobs were important are now jobless.

They go above and beyond. I have worked in warehouses a lot and this place doesn't feel like a warehouse at all. I love going to work everyday.

Bad: All shifts require weekends and working evenings into the early morning. The PTO policy is awful.

3.0,"Money to be made, but hard work","My time in Amazon was a mixed bag. If you’re sociable and friendly, the best thing you can do, is win people over (especially management) to make your life considerably easier. It is hard work, and if you are naturally a hard worker who goes above and beyond, you can feel taken advantage of at times because they will always be wanting you to do more even if you are way above your targets. The pay is good as compared to most places especially when you hit 40+ hour mark.",,,Warehouse Operative,Former Employee,United Kingdom,"January 26, 2023"

3.0,Too big to care,"Amazon is a profit focused institution that uses metrics and data to shape its business. With that they offer better benefits than pay and only through tenure will you see any raise. They let you change your schedule fore school so its good for students but very few part time roles. Management is hit and miss depending on the type of station. After 5 years of work and promotions to just to have my position eliminated for profit and handed an ultimatum of demote or bye, was not a great holiday present. You also have to know the work/pay policies to keep up with how they try to keep your pay the same when promoting or gaining tenure raises.",,,DEX Ambassador,Former Employee,"Irvine, CA","January 26, 2023"

3.0,Keeps you busy but can easily be out of work,"Good place to work if you need a second job the work can be demanding/fast paced ,but they take care of you by giving away monthly prizes,weekly pay, and increased hourly pay on certain days. However my problem is that your work days aren't guaranteed you do your 3 days of training then you have to wait until noon throughout 6 days to select the shift(s) you want to work, that's against every other employee which will leave you out of work if you're not fast enough.",,,Warehouse Worker,Current Employee,Abilene,"January 26, 2023"

Instead, how well you sell yourself while answering predetermined questions in STAR format is all that matters. You receive an inclined or not inclined status. Even getting inclined does not mean you get the position you applied for. Someone else already inclined may be offered it first. This hold true in any scenario, even in your existing team.

4.0,Quick money,If you need to make some money quickly then this job is for you. You have to be able to do the same job for 10+ hours.

2.0,After Working there for a while...,"There are different types of managers at every warehouse throughout Amazon. But this one I was hired onto had two different shift managers one half is great and the other the polar opposite.

Every day is drudgery,"If you like doing the exact same thing everyday without change, if you like completely unflexible rules and rigid caste systems, if you like unfulfilling never-ending work, then Amazon is for there is absolutely no work life balance. Amazon expects you to be 100% committed to the company. If you don't have a team spirit personality it's probably not the right job for you. 10 to 12 hour work days with constantly monitored performance. Unreasonable quotas. There is no sitting you get 15-minute breaks for a 10-hour work day and one half hour lunch. But your commute to lunch and your brakes is considered part of your lunch and breaks so you really only get about a 7 minute work break. And a 20 minute lunch. There is no outside light so you're basically in an artificial light cinder block warehouse for 10 to 12 hours a day.

Restocking the fridge could take hours at a time. Mainly, I fulfilled orders pushing a cart around then packing the order. To get orders within the 2-hour delivery guarantee, it would be very rushed. Employees would have to pick at least 110 items per hour.

Due to the supportive and friendly management that I had i felt like my voice was heard ; i felt i could go to them if i had a query, was looking for overtime or wanting training in bar work.

Butlins isn't just management though, the team that i worked with and saw almost on a daily basis is really what brought it together. Encouraging each other, having a laugh and being able to go to work knowing i had a great team there.

In all honesty as work can do there were tough days when it would get busy and hours could be long; like the adult weekend or brunches but as I said before, the team I worked with were always supportive and made things alot easier.

5.0,Productive & fun,I was seasonal so I wasn’t there long but I really enjoyed being a packer at Amazon. I had a pack rate of 104. One thing I didn’t appreciate was being told I needed to get approved for some kind of leave or accommodation to cover my negative UPT balance so I did which included paperwork done & faxed back to DLS or HR by my physician & they still terminated me for attendance.,,,Packer,Former Employee,"Park City, KS","January 22, 2023"
2.0,Demanding Work for Lower than Deserved Pay,"I worked as a long term seasonal delivery driver for Amazon themselves, not a DSP, so there was no job security. Given the daily workload of an average 150 delivery stops plus daily loading and unloading of said van, I always felt like I was going to be fired the next day for underperformance.

Colleagues regularly did not take breaks as the workload was too demanding. Criticism and complaints about the workload were met with a ""If you don't like it go work somewhere else"" attitude from the manager of the delivery station.

Lower management and direct supervisors were more personable and caring about the health and well-being of employees. Turnover was extremely high and this was us getting the easier routes compared to the DSPs (contractors' businesses at Amazon).

3.0,Okay as a part-time gig,"Working part-time as a flex associate isn't bad if you're just looking to pick up a few shifts a week.

Pros: Not stressful. You don't ""take work home with you"" when you clock out. Management at my site is chill.

Cons: If you overdo it or are working full-time, it may put too much strain on your body. They are stingy with break time. Your scanner is tracking you constantly and the whole system is set up to keep people working non-stop like robots from the time they clock in to the time they clock out.

There were only a few who gave respect, while most didn't care and that was coming from HR and senior Ops. This company only cares about its product in the building. Even the GM knew, no metal detectors coming in, so in truth, we didn't feel safe cause the only devices used to being checked was when you got off work for people that were stealing.

5.0,Temporary Seasonal,I only worked for this company part time and it was seasonal or temporary. I had a positive experience during this short period of time. My position was as an part time entry level sortation associate during the holiday season on second shift. I was resposible for scanning barcodes with a handheld scanner. For each parcel you have to scan the barcode on the parcel and then you scan the barcode for it's correct location on a specific palette. The palettes have to be put together according to the dimensions of each parcel before they can be wrapped with celophane. Each station has about fifteen palettes in alphabetical and numerical order. As a sortation associate we pay attention to the parcels coming from the conyer belt to our station. Once the parcels arrive at our assigned station we keep them from getting blocked or overflowing so that the conveyor belt can keep running. We then take those parcels as quickly as possible to their correct palatte.

2.0,"Excellent Safety Culture, BUT ITS A TRAP","Worked as a safety specialist and the safety team are required to do a rotational shift which means you do 6 months morning and 6 months evening and evening is from 6pm to 4:30am, so its literally a graveyard shift. Worst part is when you get first aid incidents just before you leave, prepare to stay longer.

They have an amazing safety culture and part of it is because they require everyone (HR, SAFETY ETC) to be onsite for all shifts. BUT THIS IS A UNINTELLIGENT THAT AMAZON HAVE NOT REALIZED YET SO FAR.

There is no way that someone who has a degree will do a graveyard shift for 6 months each year for the rest of their lives. Money will never win against having a good social life.

This is good for someone who just got out of school. Stay for a year, get out and find a better workplace that will give you a fix morning schedule or even offers hybride or work from home.

Whoever implemented this graveyard shift for people with degree is not thinking straight. As if they will do it for a long time.

The warehouse was huge and cool in the summer and warm in winter, and the cafeteria was nice and quiet and open with good snacks and stuff. But the constant pressure to hit absurdly high sorting rates by the management and the pitiful rate to accumulate time off (you only earn weekly PTO for the first 5 months of the year and it doesn't rollover to the next year, vacation does rollover but amount is determined by how long you've worked there (40 hrs earned the first 2 years, 60 year 3, and 80 every year onward), and they won't always pay your hospital bills if you get injured (or at least they didn't pay my toe exam until I got a debt collector a year after the fact.)

3.0,3rd party company madness,"As a driver for Amazon you will never work directly for Amazon but instead will work for a 3rd party company. This is where some of the issues come in. Due to this it is entirely dependent on the culture of the 3rd company as to whether or not you will enjoy your job. Some of the 3rd party companies will be scum and will attempt to circumvent the system to get more money and in doing so will put their workers in jeopardy. What I mean by this is that they will not properly maintain their vehicles, they will not follow Department of Transportation regulations for hours worked, they will not do proper maintenance checks in order to keep their vehicles on the road so that they can continue to make money. This is not true of every single 3rd party company that you will work for as an Amazon driver but could be the case for anyone that you apply to. Usually you will find that this is the case if the delivery driver job posting that you look for pays you less than 17 an hour, or if they only pay you a flat rate per day.",Nobody else around you,No breaks or time for breaks,Driver,Former Employee,"Greenville, SC","January 19, 2023"

As a young business executive and third-party sales associate with Amazon, I had the privilege of playing a key role in providing diverse types of masks, gloves, and face shields to local businesses and companies, ensuring that they were in compliance with NOISH standards. The opportunity to work with healthcare practitioners as well as international manufacturers of masks not only provided me with a unique learning experience but also helped me to understand the importance of diversity, equity and inclusion in the sales process.

Despite the challenges that arose due to the supply chain issues, I was able to work closely with Amazon's logistics team to resolve them and ensure that the masks were delivered on time and to the right people and companies. This experience not only improved my problem-solving skills but also taught me the importance of being adaptable and responsive to changing market conditions.

Overall, I highly recommend becoming a third-party sales associate with Amazon as it provides key knowledge and skills for anyone considering a career in sales. The process of automating orders and streamlining supply chain logistics helped me to become more efficient and effective in my role. The experience I gained while working with Amazon has been invaluable, and I continue to learn from it.

4.0,New facility with lots of opportunities,The job was easy to do and the people are relatively nice. Because it's a new facility still being worked on the flow isn't as great. I didn't like the hours you either come in really early and get out late or come in late and get out really early. I had to pump during my breaks and lunch but there was always some guy lactation room using it. You aren't always sure about your hour. When it's slow they always want to cut your hours.

But they have very unrealistic goals in the DLS department. They took over their own leave and disability right before the start of the pandemic and they are still scrambling as of 2022/2023. It’s stressful trying to meet their expectations when they (department heads, managers, etc) don’t even know what they are doing themselves. They need a revamp. They have 10001 unnecessary practices and policies in place. Honestly. If you work in the warehouse and need time off - it’s not hard to get it from Amazon.

I immediately quit and went to Amazon, which paid me $16.50 per hour, including a $3,000 bonus. Amazons work is not fun and is difficult, but it got my life back together.

3.0,You are meant to be a machine,"To be very clear on something, if you are not above the job classification of Manager then Amazon does not care about you outside of making sure they don't get sued.

If you need money and are very healthy I'd say go for it. Even then make it a stepping stone job unless you plan to raise yourself up into a higher level position. Your coworkers for the most part are decent people and a lot of the managers tend to be okay as well.

In the end though never force yourself to stay and when quitting make sure to use the systems they have in place for it.

2.0,"Good benefits, but everything else was sub par","The job structure at Amazon focuses on limiting the amount of free time of the ""standard employee"", while giving management an easy way to blame employees for bad quotas. As any employee with a position less than floor manager, you are tracked in almost everything you do, and are expected to meet daily quotes that do not change much between positions. Even as an IT worker, I was expected to meet minimum hours logged per day while my manager only came in once every 2 weeks. The amount of freedom given to management is honestly ridiculous.",,,I.T.

1.0,Selling Partner Support for UK,"Really bad place to work.
-You have 20 mins per week of personal time (to use the bathroom for example) they seem to forget we are human beings.
-You must complete assessments in order to secure your job.
-Everything is micromanaged.
-They’ve installed a new program so you are just bombarded with calls and there are loads of bugs which aren’t being fixed. Example: you can receive numerous calls at the same time.
-There’s very little support when you need help.
-Training is very rushed and when you need help the help isn’t hardly there.
-They are very strict with productivity, which isn’t fair as there is a lot of pressure with calls in general and it’s impossible to meet their high standards.
-They say they are obsessed with Customer Obsession. This is false. All I hear all day long with customers is how little satisfied they are with Amazon. And in general you can just tell by managers that there is no “Customer Obsession”.
-Salary is really low, doubt there will be raises in salary.
-Hours at work are very long in general.
-You get trained for different skills but you don’t learn a lot because the training (you have to pass an assessment) is rushed and then when you deal with live contacts you have no clue what to do. You end up feeling really bad for the customer.
- After you have finished a call, you only have 2 mins to annotate everything and investigate and send an email, bad luck if you don’t because you’ll soon receive another call.

- I honestly don’t understand why we can’t handle one case at a time. We are NOT robots and this puts a tole on your mental health!",,,Selling Partner Support,Current Employee,"Cork, County Cork","January 13, 2023"

1.0,I regret having come here.,"High turnover with mid-level management led to an inconsistent team culture. People seemed to actively look for opportunities to screw coworkers over in order to get closer to promotion, which was very tough to obtain. Account managers often do the work of the account execs who just show face, and no one cares.

Really wonky technology/internal systems, and lots of manual processes that interfered with necessary productivity.

Finally, unbearable culture and stingy RSU vesting structure. Coworkers were constantly and brutally berated, they wouldn't fire you or put you on an impossible PIP until right before your shares were due to vest, and there were very few perks.

2.0,"Easy job, general customer service and handling customer packages. But not worth applying.",I truly do not recommend this job. Because Its really hard to get any shifts. Especially if you apply for a Whole Foods location. Not worth your time so save your time and apply elsewhere. The job is easy to learn and do. Only 1 person per shift and everyone competes for their favorite shifts. Team trainer gossips like she's still in high school and managers are non-existent.,,,Amazon Locker+ Customer Service,Former Employee,"Los Angeles, CA","January 11, 2023"
2.0,Work-Life-Balance is non-existent; You can move up fairly quickly,The job itself from the beginning was all about number not people. It was about how fast can you make them slow down payroll and give you advancements to replace more people. The benefits were great. The RSU was amazing. The upper management were supportive but my direct manager was not. I had to learn everything on my own as manager. I had no shift assistant during the shift and had to run the warehouse alone without anyone helping me. We did have one day a week where there were two managers but that happens rare at times since other managers would call out. I learned a lot about Amazon and logistics in a short amount of time. I would get phone calls to troubleshoot issues when I was off or sleeping right before my shift. I could hardly breathe during the shift and it gave me so much anxiety not to meet expectations. After my shift I usually have to do my own Gemba walk and clean up the station after unloading all night and staging with my staff just to meet our metrics. If you like a fast paced environment and like to help others and deliver smiles. This is it for you,,,Assistant Manager (L4),Former Employee,Bethpage,"January 11, 2023"

4.0,It’s what you make of it.,"I’ve been on board for two months now. The work is easy. 90% of your job is showing up. Most managers are happy with getting 50% out of you. They just want warm bodies that’ll show up. That said, there’s not much to do at the ground level. You move boxes. Out of the truck and onto the line, off the line into cages, and from cages into the bins. On the other side, just the opposite. It’s not rocket science. The starting pay is good for what you’re doing, $18.50/hr. Benefits kick in day one, and they’re good. They also offer 401(k) from the first day with 100% match up to 4%. There are about 8 days a year in which they pay 8 hours of holiday pay. If you work those days, you get paid 1.5x in addition to the holiday pay. They also give regenerating pools of unpaid time off for personal time, unpaid time off, sick leave, and paid time off. All of them accrue at different rates based on hours worked. There are two types of people that work at Amazon. Those that want a job, and those that want a career. If you’re the ladder; make sure your leadership knows. You have to take control of your progress. Otherwise you’ll just be another drone in the hive. Most of the warehouse can be described as adult daycare. I wouldn’t pay half the people there minimum wage, they’re just not worth it. Surround yourself with the hard workers. Take initiative to learn things outside of your standard work.

1.0,1 star,"What is the best part of working at the company?
I’ve met a lot of great people there but the job overall is not worth it.

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
Management, HR, not getting paid enough for the physical labor.

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?
For the time I was there, it was alright. The environment wasn’t the greatest due to the company getting complaints from the employees about a lot of things, but it would have its good and bad days.

3.0,Neutral Experience,I would have stayed with the company but they made us work 55 hours four weeks straight during peak season and I am not built to do that. Working night shift is hard as it is but doing that 5 nights straight while caring for toddlers during the day is not a good combination.

4.0,"Fairly hard work, some good managers, 1 awful manager",Worked there for 18 months and overall a positive experience. Other staff was more useful for the experience though certain managers were very helpful though one was a complete pain. Ten-hour night shifts were hard work and very tiring but only 4 shifts a week then three days off which was needed to recover. Different tasks each shift were usually the case but if you had a particular preference (such as loading or stowing) then these could be accommodated by speaking to line managers.,,,Sortation Associate,Former Employee,Droitwich,"January 11, 2023"

4.0,"Good training, pay, and overall job. Disappointing job security.","Working at the ERC, was a nice remote job. Equipment is provided, as well as a 4 - 5 week training time, and the managers as well as trainers truly do care for your success to do a great job.

Most of the time you are speaking to internal employees, basically as a call center. There is a QA that pinpoints your KPI. However, there is room for special projects and some room for advancement.

I was on a contract just to learn that no one will be converted after multiple times of being promised for job security, even being one of the top marks for KPI with 0 error margin, hence the ending of my employment.",,,HR Assistant II/ERC,Former Employee,Remote,"January 10, 2023"

4.0,Overall a good company to work at,"PROs:
1. Pay/benefits/PTO competitive and good.
2. FREE parking
3. Good break room
4. Good PERKS (e.g., FREE Safety shoes, FREE meal once a year for holidays, FREE prize during Peak Season for a job well done n hard work.
5. FREE drinking water
CONs:
1. Appears to be a lot favoritism; person assigning workstation, their buddies get good/middle sections, while the older/50s were assigned end workstation (hard to make rate) got assigned harder jobs; seems kinda backwards
2. Safety was always verbalized it was a high priority, but employees/coworkers always seemed to get hurt/injured, and when you did, you/employee were blamed for the injury.

Regardless, Amazon is a pretty good work environment and good place to work at","Pay/benefits competitive good, work/life balance good, diverse","A lot of favoritism, a lot of people getting injured on the job",FC Associate I,Former Employee,"Akron, OH","January 9, 2023"

3.0,Communication issues but generally ok,"I always said ""The only consistent thing about Amazon is that it's inconsistent"". Communication between Transportation and Logistics about which dock doors to use was hit or miss and could change without notice.

We were expected to check in trucks within a short time with no consideration to the amount of info required on yard passes or language barriers or missing/disorganized paperwork. We were directed to pull trucks up out of the ""timer zone"" to keep average times down.

Even so, most of the managers I worked under were very cool and understanding since they started out as drivers. However, one of the lead managers acted like he was on your side but really only cared about covering his butt and was a major factor for me deciding to leave.

Fellow night shift coworkers were a fun group and it felt like we were all in it together. Move count expectations were tempered well by making the moves safely but double securing and unsecuring the trailer doors EVERY move was very tiring.

I was diagnosed with a major medical problem while working here and the medical insurance covered everything.",,,Transportation Associate,Former Employee,"Hebron, KY","January 8, 2023"
1.0,Lonely Work,This is definitely the loneliest job I have ever had. You sit at home speaking to only customers. If you ever have to speak to someone in Amazon it's about a complaint so every conversation with customers immediately start on a bad note. It's impossible to build a relationship with anyone as the only time you speak with colleagues is during 'team meetings' but that's when you're manager likes to take the spotlight. If you need to go to the bathroom you need to take 'personal time' but you can't take more than 5 minutes a day. You will literally be chained to your desk picking up call after call with not even a second in between. If you want to go progress further your manager has to put you up for it and my manager was awful so it's really luck of the draw.,,,Customer Service Advisor,Former Employee,"Dublin, County Dublin","January 8, 2023"

I believe that it was a good job while I worked there and it is also a resume booster. I think that the company should give out a better employee discount. I believe it was a 1 percent discount on orders on Amazon.com. The hardest part working full time was it was only 2 15 minute breaks and a 30 minute lunch when I believe it should have been an hour lunch.

You will be told your self employed but Amazon dictate what you ""MUST"" do with. They will change your start times with as little as half a days notice. Overload you with parcels. Over Christmas they drop the volume to attract new drivers then pay about £20 more per day for the extra volume then come January they drop the money but not the volume. It's a very deceitful company to work for and when you look at your expenses at the end of the year expect at least a third of your annual income to be gone. One guy earnt 32k doing 5 days a week for 52 weeks but his expenses were 15k so took home 17k.

The atmosphere was very negative at times, some co workers were great but there were more negative ones. The supervisors dont do anything even though they need to help us and very rude at times. It didnt feel like we were a team. There was lots of favoritism, and the managers,I feel, dont care about the workers only themselves and make sure the workers make them look good.

Management will lie to you about anything and everything just to make sure whatever happens, happens the way they want it to. You will have no autonomy, no control, and no dignity. Raises never happen, breaks are not a thing, and forget about having days off because if something needs to be done and a manager doesn’t want to do it, believe me, they’ll force you to do it.

1.0,"""this is not a monetary promotion, this is a responsibility promotion""","Your existence is not acknowledged there. Your presence to the company is as mundane as the parts flowing on an assembly line. You're assigned spot in a lifeless warehouse many feet from other people, and that's how it goes 10 hours a day for 4 days a week.

At best you're a stower that stands within a 8x8 space and do not have to do even worse positions; moving hundreds if not thousands of pounds of merchandise into shelves across the whole shift in very meager compensation.

Bathrooms and break rooms are far from stations, meaning you spend half your breaks walking to rest, and then already have to be rushing back to your stations. You're monitored like hawks, by eyes, cameras, and even the network as they can track where you're logged in at.

Hard work is punished with terrible ""promotions"", where your labor is increased without any increased compensation or quality of life. If you do too good in performance, they will find you at your station and pull you into a mandatory promotion. ""This is not a monetary promotion, this is a responsibility promotion"" is what they tell you in your face; and you will regret not telling them ""no"". Becoming a Water spider or any higher non-supervision position is extremely grueling. You're moving tens of thousands of pounds of pallets within a day, and unloading each several hundred pounds of merchandise off each pallet; doing this for multiple work stations. if you stop running and moving at 100% , you will fall behind and never catch up the rest of the day.

The only way to advance or even be considered for advancement is to be very good friends with a manager, though usually another manager because finding your own can be a struggle. I would highly recommend finding a person or two that you like talking with, because outside of them (and even sometimes with them) everyone will be trying to beat you down verbally behind your back.

2.0,Seemed very unorganized.,"Every day I would have no idea how many hours id be working clocking in. We had a small meeting before the shift started and they would tell us if the shift duration would be anywhere within 3-6 hours. As much as that doesn't seem like a terrible idea, some days I would go in ready to work and put some time in just to be told we only had a 3-hour shift that day. On other days I would have something planned after work just to be told I was working a 6-hour after working 3-hour shifts previously in the week, therefore, expecting a lighter workload. It was almost impossible to ask anyone for assistance and I couldn't even tell you who MY manager was there wasn't any clear one person to go to besides for hr but you had to walk all the way up front just to deal with them being in a bad mood and telling you to find some manager instead. All around not the best experience it may have been my department but I don't know none of it seemed amazing and to top it off the environment is depressing you lose all sense of time and almost turn into a zombie.",,,Returns Associate,Former Employee,"Oklahoma City, OK","January 2, 2023"

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
Trying to keep up with the production requirements. They write associates up according to who the computer says has the lowest rates. If the machines are down, it affects your rate. So you can be written up even when you don't have control of your production rate.

Best part would be that a lot of the time work was easy and customers were generally friendly. Even when they weren't it was tolerable.

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
Poor communication from higher ups. Poor staffing at times, toxic work culture, complicit management (not all of them) in said toxic culture. Constant changes in protocol- not having good communication about changes.

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?
My experience was that the work culture was very toxic. All the way up to management it was riddled with backbiting and gossip. Reports to management of wrongdoings were met with excuses with no action being taken. I only felt comfortable with one maybe two of my managers out of 5. Even with regular associates it is well- known that there was plenty of favoritism going on higher up. It only got worse as I got promoted. A manager was heard gossiping to an associate which is super unprofessional. This is more of a location issue than company wide problem I’m sure.

What is a typical day like for you at the company?
Depends on the department. Back of house operations were easy unless it involved an overstuffed cooler or freezer which was very common. Front end it depends on how many people are staffed. Some days were easy if we had proper staffing.

3.0,"Poor management at a fast-pace, poor work-life balance place that I wouldn't stay for long","I've worked at 5 sites and they're all roughly the same. There's a list of daily duties you'll have to complete. For example pulling reports, fixing timesheets, teaching associates and area managers the rules and policies, team meetings, operation meetings, working on your project, and sometime you may have to conduct an investigation. You'll constantly have work to do and it's never-ending.

You'll have to learn on the job and you'll need your coworker's help to catch up so be friendly. We were understaffed but managers will still push you to meet all their expectations and will make you feel guilty for taking time off. Burnout and poor work-life balance are common so take care of yourself because managers will not care. Everyone is looking out for themselves and may throw you underneath the bus. People will fake it in their role, so find your own answer to double-check. People don't normally stay after 1 year. There's a common saying that however long you worked at the company, times it by two because you'll see and experience a lot in a short frame.

1.0,"Top down authoritarian management, minimal oportunity to advance.","FYI, I only worked at a wagon wheel and in a full time, but turned out to be temporary position at a distribution center 55 miles from my home. Other people may have had a different experience at Amazon.

At my wagon wheel station, the only people who actually held a job and had benefits were management. All other employees are Flex Temp, and have to grab shifts when they are posted daily for a work date a week in the future. This seems great but when you have 250+ people competing for 25-30 shifts every day, you don't always get to work. Pay is good if you can get a shift. They are constantly hiring to maintain that large pool of flex workers.
If you are in college and want to work for Amazon, my advice would be, to finish college, and then apply for the job you want going in, you will be treated better. They will pay for some of your college if you are a full time employee, but not if you are a flex temp employee. (90% of the people who work for Amazon are Flex Temp) Promotions seem to be based on what looks good for their EOE statement and not to get the best person into the right position. Yeah they have a ping pong table, but the trick is getting your coworkers away from it to do their jobs. The company is very WOKE.

I actually regretted not applying sooner because I listened to people complain about working there. You don't have to have experience or education to start and you can move up quickly.

3.0,A job that gets boring with little to no advancement.,"TLDR; It's a job. Pays better than most. But the job takes more than it gives.

Good luck thinking you'll ever move up in this job as a regular joe without playing the favorites game or applying as an external. I worked for 2 years. Good pay for an entry level job though. Alright benefits too (especially for entry level). I went, clocked in, worked, clocked out, and went home. During ""peak"", there's mandatory overtime. But beware. If your performance is below average, they will let you go. Little-to-no job security. I developed back pain at a young age. Some nights. I'd go home with a pain so bad that I couldn't stand or walk (developing lower back strength at the gym helped a lot. helpful hack for new hires). Just don't expect the ""family"" vibe from here. It doesn't exist (unless you're in management or a specialty department). Take advantage of free training if it's available to you. Especially IT training. It will help you long after your career at Amazon.

I guess my favorite times include getting free t-shirts and our building anniversary (we had food catered). Also collecting Peccy pins.",,,Warehouse Associate,Former Employee,Connecticut,"December 28, 2022"
