4.0,Productive and easy work.,"FC Associate I (Former Employee) - Dallas, TX - March 6, 2023","Amazon gives a bunch of opportunities to grow in the workplace for sure. Whether it be to go and start school or to finish it! They train you and make sure you understand your job and willing to listen to your questions. Working with them will get you exhausted but that’s fine it’s like a free workout for only less than 5 days a week. No stressful situations or dealing with customers especially if you’re an introverted person. It gives you flexibility on doing things outside of work, like go to a dr’s appointment or watching your child’s game or event and even being able to take a vacation! It isn’t always for everyone considering the labor but you can always try it out and leave whenever you want to without having to do 1 or 2 week notices.

5.0,Productive fast paced exciting and a friendly environment !!!,"FC Associate I (Current Employee) - Sacramento, CA - March 6, 2023","What is the best part of working at the company?
I like the job itself accountability in individual work ethics. The responsibility of work being done in a timely manner. Causes you to maintain and develop good working habits. This type job does not allow you time to not work!

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
Only stress is accounting for time loss and not making any productive value to Amazon. Keeping up with the fast work pace from the time you clock in to the end of your shift.

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?
Work environment is good there are a lot of benefits and incentives working for Amazon. They do a lot for the team everyday tips; exercise before shift, standup talks on safety, they supply your shoes, vests, gloves, safety glasses, first aid kits etc.

What is a typical day like for you at the company?
I come to work excited about being a part of a team. My shift starts greeting my co-workers at the time clock. We stretch sand exercise before any work starts. We also hear from management anything we should be aware of. Also discuss any concerns or issues any team member may have. We do discuss safety issues or accidents major or minor everyday.

We get an overall idea of how we are doing as a team. How we can improve getting packages out to better serve our customers.

We are then given our assigned areas by our scanners and we go to work immediately.",,
3.0,Vermutlich guter Arbeitgeber,"Maschinenschlosser / Industriemechaniker RMA (Former Employee) - Rheinberg - March 6, 2023","Ich haette gerne weiter bei Amazon gearbeitet, aber scheinbar ist ein Wort vom Manager nicht viel Wert. Im Dezember 2022 habe ich mich nach 9 Tagen am Knie verletzt. Kein Unfall einfach so. Da ich gerade erst angefangen hatte war ich total erschrocken und habe gehofft, wie besprochen das die Probezeit nach hinten verlängert wird. Der fuer mich zuständige Manager hat bis zum 27.1.23 durchgehalten und dann aber die Kündigung aussprechen lassen. Sehr schlecht und kein persönliches Gespräch. Manager im mittleren Alter ca. 45 Jahre. Ich finde es echt schade, vor allem weil ich jeden Tag lesen muss das Amazon Rheinberg Techniker RMA sucht. Vielleicht dachte man auch ich habe keinen Bock auf den Job. Irrtum auf Mails oder andere anschreiben wurde überhaupt nicht geantwortet. Naja wie schon gesagt, ich habe mich auf den Job gefreut und wurde in den Hintern getreten weil ich mich ohne Unfall etc verletzt habe. Zur Beruhigung kann ich mir immer nur sagen, wenn man so mit Arbeitnehmern umgeht dann soll man sich nicht wundern das sowas negativ nach außen getragen wird. Schade der Job waere genau das richtige fuer mich gewesen",,

However when I went to man2 my job was packing and Trainer when required. The job was a nightmare timed breaks timed toilet breaks. You had to meet targets for packing also there where targets in everyother department and the managers where only there because they had just passed their degree at university, it was a joke you are treated like a robot.

1.0,I cant actively give my opinion in this ad without swearing,"Warehouse Associate (Former Employee) - Cambridge, ON - March 6, 2023","Don't work here. There is literally nothing positive I can say about the management or Amazon as a company. The work itself I enjoyed doing as I like physically demanding jobs, however I did not like being asked to perform the job of three people while others are only able to do a third of their job and remain employed. Not only that, but those same individuals will be hired on, or given more and more contract extensions, over hard working employees if they happen to have been employed before you. There is no reason to work hard, just show up every day. The company doesnt value performance at all, in fact you will be penalized for it by being asked to do more and more until one day you are hurt or they just dont renew your contract. Amazon doesnt hire good workers, they hold on to mediocre ones so when a time comes for downsizing they can then go to performance as a rationale.",,

Rules aren’t followed as far as loading is concerned especially when a thousand boxes are coming down the line. In the winter working in the trailers is very cold. Clocking in on your phone used to be allowed but that was taken away. Flex positions are awful especially if you’ve reached your limit you must stay or be docked or your time off hours. If there’s not enough work you will be sent home not meeting your hourly goal. Do not accept a part time position. Insurance isn’t offered with part time and if you hurt yourself there’s no way for medical coverage except out of your pocket or filing workers comp which is horrible.,,

Job is very low stress, and somewhat boring at times. Very easy job for the money, but you are just a number and easily replaced.
The safety rules continuously get more strict, and some are downright unrealistic. You are coached on how to drive trucks by managers who have never driven a truck.....makes no sense.

Works best to lay out a mid-term and long-term plan of where you want to go next positionally or geographically within the company to advance yourself professionally and personally. If full-time, take advantage of the education award and use the health insurance, vision, and dental benefits to take care of your health, eyes, back (chiro), and rest of your body. Get plenty of rest before shifts. Remember, you are pretty much a warehouse athlete in some positions (10-12 hour shifts, 60,000+ steps in a single busy shift, etc.) If you don't have a plan while working at a fulfillment/warehouse center, don't stay there long enough to beat up your body detrimentally without an exit strategy.

2.0,No Real Chance of Advancement/Barely Any Raises/Robotic and Painfully Monotonous,"Amazon Warehouse Associate (Current Employee) - Ottawa, ON - March 4, 2023","Been working at Amazon for over a year. During the first year I was on Water spider and Stow. Walked about 10 miles per day/lifting thousands of totes and boxes doing Water spider. I was doing the job of 2-3 people some days. I am a top performer in the company. Transferred to another facility. A random employee was aggressive towards me within my 2nd day shift there. The Management promotes new people and ignores the people who have been there longer. The job,(especially in stow),is monotonous, isolating and highly repetitive. Most employees leave feeling mentally drained by robotic, repetitive tasks that leave them time to do nothing but think as they have to work in complete silence. Then I found out that since I transferred from another facility I have to wait a year and a half to be eligible for a 10 cent raise. I'm actually paying more to live where I transferred to! This job enhances anxiety and depression. The pay is not keeping up with inflation but it's still better than some other warehouses pay and there are some decent benefits. Most Amazon facilities are in the middle of nowhere which creates travel time issues for workers. Also ,it feels like a prison setting as there are only windows at the front entrance and breakrooms. The average Amazon employee stays at Amazon for about 8-9 months. The brainpower required for this job is practically Nil and you learn just how materialistic people are and how much stuff people buy that they don't actually need while doing this job.",,

Being good at your job does not necessarily mean you will get a promotion. It seemed that the only thing that mattered was the extracurricular things that you did.

You still put in the same amount of hours but the size and scale of your projects get bigger. Also you will get paid drastically less than an external hire at the same level.

2.0,Mentally exhausting,"Warehouse Associate (Former Employee) - Tulsa, OK - March 1, 2023","I worked at Amazon for 3 years. I was trained in stow, pick, decant, outbound dock, pack, and also problem solved for a little bit. The main problem with amazon is the management and the higher ups. There are little to no managers that have ever done the work of a warehouse Associate. Due to Amazon's high turnover rate they would rather hire people straight out of college than treat their employees good and hire from within. I went through 4 different managers in my first year, and the last one just graduated from college and had never even had a job before. I'm not sure how they thought that would work out but that's amazon for you. Everyday you come in and go to your department. 99% of the time they will be overstaffed and offer you voluntary time off with no pay, or they will send you to another department with no training and just expect you to figure it out. You are also tracked for everything you do. The bottom 5% of rates get written up every week and it is automatically generated. That meaning that if you encountered a problem that caused your rate to fall that wasn't necessarily your fault, you get written up with no chance to explain why. The goal rate is based on a assumed mix of 60% small items and 40% large. Small items are faster to work, but you never have small items so you are in constant fear of your rate being low even though there is nothing you can do about it. Everyone that is working is always in a poopy mood due to the work environment. In 3 years I made no friends at all at Amazon because you don't really have to time to get to know your Co workers.",,

3.0,"Fast paced, horrible but a steady wage and fixed weekly hours is good","FC Associate (Current Employee) - Mansfield - February 27, 2023","I like that the hours are set, you have fixed hours every week and if not enough work they give the option to go home. It means you can generally plan your self as you know when you are working and your income and if they need you in extra days you can get paid for it as overtime. You can also easily swap a day or night you want to work if needed.
Amazon does offer a load of benefits, but they seem too complicated to use and to know how much they are a benefit!

Shifts are 10 hours long and on your feet all the time, with 2 breaks about half an hour. Can be tiring. Forced to work at a fast pace and on higher levels it can feel a toxic atmosphere, but on a basic level as an associate it feels OK to just do your job, get paid and go home, unless they are saying you are too low. Obviously annoying as you can only go with what they say, you don't have true insight into how everyone is actually doing on the job.

4 hour shifts a month. But then they changed it to minimum of one 4 hour shift per week minimum. And then things started changing again. Forever changing rules, etc.

This must have been due to the job centering around the pandemic(at least when I started working there) and when the pandemic started to die down, things changed.


But still overall the most flexible, laid back job Ive ever had. Kinda felt like you were your own boss.

Drag yourself into a job you do not want to do. Start working, get pulled over to discuss a quality error. Get back to work repeating the same task over and over. Talk about rate. Justify hurrying as a possible chance to move up, or get a raise. Go to break. Come back and listen to a manager’s ego talk. Hear about whatever the site director is pushing through managers. After that motivational moment go back to repeating a task over and over. Go on another break.

They work you to death, you don’t get holidays, the pay doesn’t match the labor, and you’re heavily micromanaged. I was a stower and a problem solver. Management is great depending where you’re working in the building/who you’re working with. On the other hand, management could be trash like I experienced. Amazon offers four or five different kinds of time you can take off. Some paid, the rest unpaid. During orientation I took a lot of notes, I highly recommend doing so, because they like to switch things up on people, especially with the sign on bonus—good luck getting that. If you do work for them they don’t test for weed, just hard drugs (which I hope you don’t do to begin with). Everyone gets in honestly, but you barely get a break. While they do have allotted times for break, your spot for it better be close. If it isn’t I promise you’ll spend 60% of your break speed walking to and from your break area. You have to clock out at a station that isn’t close, then go eat or nap and be st your station the SECOND your break is over ready to get back in the routine. Good luck man.

The management was poor and only interested in one thing delivering the parcel at all costs. You will get added to a group chat and you will only get told the night before if you have a route for the next day meaning you cannot plan anything as you will not know when your days off are. Long hours for pay which isn't worth it when u take your van cost and fuel cost into account you will be lucky to get £300 a week.,,

Work conditions are not suitable, especially if you're sick. I got covid from this place--even when I was fully vaccinated since the return system is awful. Even if you're training, they can write you up if you don't ""hit your numbers."" Tell you if you have issues you can talk to them, I did and got in trouble for it. HR does not know how to do its job properly. No chance of growth at all. Every week, you accumulate 2 hours of PTO and PTO Sick; so it makes it hard to take PTO early or even be sick.

3.0,It's an OK Job.,"Ambassador (Former Employee) - irvine - February 20, 2023","Treat it like a job, not a career. Little to no room for promotion, despite what managers might say. You might be able to get up to supervisor if you're what they're looking for, but otherwise do not expect much unless they have specific jobs listed.

Work was simple enough, help out drivers with problems, sort boxes and bags, then repeat. Depending on your manager, they can be relaxed or hovering over your shoulder. I recommend finding another job as soon as possible. This can be good for experience at least. Good coworkers will keep you sane",,
1.0,Poor Management Skills,"Sorter/Packer (Former Employee) - Pontiac, MI - February 20, 2023","I hired in for the money & medical insurance. 3k sign-on bonus after 6 months, sounds awesome right? 4 months in & none of management are on the same page, constant write ups over everything, no room for advancement.

3.0,"Physically (and emotionally) demanding, but straightforward and simple","Delivery Warehouse Associate (Former Employee) - Massachusetts - February 20, 2023","I worked here for 2 months and only in my final weeks did my feet start to not kill me. I left work every day covered in grime and bruises and in pain. If I didn't have copious amounts of pain killers on hand I wouldn't have survived any of the days. You are on your feet and in constant motion, the only rest time being the 30 minute lunch time and two 15 minute breaks. By the final 3 hours of every shift I was mentally begging God to end my suffering despite being completely non-religious. Despite all this, honestly not a terrible place to work. It's impossible to do anything those 4 days after work because you're too exhausted, but the 3 days off in a row were pretty nice. The people there were generally pretty chill, and all the managers were kind and understanding. Good for both people who like to work silently on their own and who like to causally converse, with the different roles you can be assigned in a day allowing for either. Also great if you don't want to go to the gym, this job serves as an intense 10 hour work out a day. If you like strong structure, clear responsibility, and the ability to mind your own business independently most of the day. To be honest as well, this job is great for neurodivergent people and attracts a lot of autistic people, so as someone on the spectrum I felt right at home here. Also, ask to be trained on induct asap. Trust me.",,

3.0,Be prepared to lift heavy boxes,"Warehouse Associate (Former Employee) - Bolton, ON - February 19, 2023","I was surprised when I started working here that women would be doing most of the heavy lifting. Management would often put like 10 women, maybe one man in the most heaviest lifting section, and all of us were worried about injury. And I would see big strong men scanning envelopes.
This heavy, constant, non-stop lifting bothered my wrist.
As well the Pallet Jack is manual. So you have to push or pull 1000+ pounds at a time from one part of the warehouse to the other- which is sooo hard on the knees.",,

3.0,Work Atmosphere,"Transportation Analyst (Current Employee) - Atlanta, GA - February 19, 2023","Often in my department, managers are cliquish; if you aren't in the clique or they don't like you, you could potentially be overlooked or mistreated. A lack of utilization of valuable skills in the team is compounded by favoritism for managers' friends. As a result, rather than promoting those who excel within the team, those roles are given to their friends while qualified employees train them.",,
4.0,Fun and flexible workplace,"Pit Operator (Former Employee) - Perris, CA - February 19, 2023","I had a fun time when I worked at Amazon, above average benefits with a great college benefit. Very flexible with scheduling time off with PTO vacation and unpaid time.",,
1.0,Awful,"Shipping/Pack Team Lead (Current Employee) - Mansfield, Nottinghamshire - February 19, 2023",Amazon EMA2 is an awful place to work. Management don’t care about anyone all the focus on are metrics. Leadership/managers only care for them selves,,
5.0,Great benefits,"Warehouse Associate (Current Employee) - Tucson, AZ - February 19, 2023","Amazon has an excellent benefits package and they are generous with giving you time off if you need it (granted, if you run out of your 40 hrs PTO every year then it is unpaid time). It's great because you don't have to ""call in"" if you are sick you just request time off with the employee app. The work can get boring sometimes but it is nothing too outrageous. Sometimes they get on you about rates but as long as you do your job the rate won't matter because you will meet it. Breaks are too short considering how far the break areas are from the work stations. Moving up can sometimes be hard if your resume doesn't ""look good"" to the computer that scans it. I would still recommend the job though.",,

It had people on that side there for a day to several years. They didn’t care. Cuts are cuts. They won’t hesitate or care. You are a number.

However if you successfully complete a performance plan then you are good to go.

KPI/Metrics are fairly easy in comparison to other companies i've worked for. You REQUIRED to lead various projects and make yourself known amongst the org. This is great if that is your style but if you expect to just do your job and go home you are sadly mistaken...",,
4.0,Good place to start career,"Package Handler (Former Employee) - Stockton, CA - February 17, 2023","Looking back, I wish that I stayed at Amazon longer than I did. It’s a good place to start working at. The interview is easy, because it’s just a drug check and background check. Also some of the people there were pretty cool. It was easy to get along with the supervisors. PTO and time off are easy to take and it gets added every quarter. On holidays employees get off early. In addition, they help pay for college tuition and offer multiple benefits. Also, if you quit, they will probably rehire you.
However, working at Amazon also has its cons. Work days can go by slowly depending on your role. During peak season employees work longer days, sometimes 12 hours. Also there was this one snitch, and some of the workers gossip.
Overall, Amazon is a great place to work for. They offer good benefits. The PTO and time off is easy to take. I would recommend this job to anyone who can lift 40 pounds or more and stand for the full 8 hours. If you’re lucky enough to work here, take this job seriously, learn something and move up.",,

Management would change your schedule out of nowhere while you've been employed for some time. For example, if you chose to start at 7am, they changed it to 6:30am without consulting you. Other people had it worse, they would start at about 1am and got moved to 6:30am without accommodation.
Employees have expressed that they would love to return to WFH, but do not, instead pizza is supposed to be motivating.

5.0,Productive and Fun Workplace,"Warehouse Worker (Former Employee) - Anaheim, CA - February 14, 2023","As a former Amazon warehouse worker, I can say with certainty that the job is an absolute nightmare. The work is physically grueling and the pace is unrelenting. You're expected to move quickly and efficiently, often without sufficient breaks or time to rest. The company's focus on productivity over employee well-being is evident in the punishing workloads and unrealistic targets. The management is harsh and unforgiving, and there's a constant feeling of being watched and evaluated. The pay is low, and the hours are long and irregular, making it difficult to plan your life outside of work. The company's commitment to meeting customer demand at any cost has created an environment that is toxic and dehumanizing. Overall, Amazon treats its workers as expendable cogs in a massive, profit-driven machine. I would not recommend this job to anyone who values their physical or mental health.",,
