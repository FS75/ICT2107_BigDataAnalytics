2,5.0,Alot of Jobs One Home,"There are a lot of pros working for Accenutre. They have great career opportunities, a never ending supply of interesting work, competitive compensation, wonderful benefits, great people, wonderful training programs, a tremendous number of brilliant professionals in their fields ready to help, and great core values.",This is not an opportunity for those that do not want to work. At Accenture everyone has a load of work to do and often times under very tight customer time lines. It is a challenge that I enjoy but many might find it stressful.,Infrastructure Manager,Current Employee,"West Lafayette, IN","Sep 21, 2015"
3,1.0,"Toxic, Incestuous and Suck-Up culture !","I was a lateral senior hire from another firm into Accenture’s Strategy Consulting practice. And boy oh boy, I had no idea what a toxic place a work environment could be in todays times, and in the US, especially amongst supposedly well educated and composed folks. I was in for the rudest shock I have experienced in my 15 year career. The other ‘senior managers’ were rude, unwelcoming, abrupt, closeted and down right hostile. The partners to whom they had sworn their loyalty to, sheparded them, coddled, and ‘protected’ them, gave them the choicest billable roles, while I was the black unwanted sheep. It took a few months to realize, the toxic, inbred, incestuous culture was one of ‘BROWN NOSING YOUR WAY UP’ ! The way to cling to and climb the ladder was purely based on this one vital ability ! A lateral hire, though more qualified and creative, was a threat, to the insecure incestuous bunch. I was later told during my exit interview, ‘yes, it’s difficult to assimilate as a senior lateral hire !” !!! HA ! So, if you want to go jump into a toxic hole, then be my guest. To me, it was one of the worst experiences in my life ! Ever wonder where these genes came from ? Look just back to the deceptive ‘Anderson Consulting’ days….the Apple doesn’t fall far from the tree. And look for their breed implanted in other companies, which is traditional practice in consulting, for them to ferry and curry out consulting deals to their heathen !",See pros above for your creative process to imagine what the cons could possibly be !,Senior Manager,Former Employee,"New York, NY","Mar 7, 2023"
4,2.0,They need to take more responsibility to give new hires real opportunities,"Smart people, good resources, great client base","There isn't any time to learn on the job and everyone assumes you will know exactly what to do on day one, so be careful what level you come in at. Lower levels are safer because analysis work is pretty standard and managers and senior managers will give you templates and more guidance. Senior managers are basically screwed because managing directors don't have time to show them the ropes and the rest of the team is depending on them to already know how to do it a certain way the team is used to. When trying to get on projects, senior managers and managers will also find out that managing directors already have their favorite ""go to"" people they have worked with for years, so they will ONLY pick you if those people are unavailable. Because of the fast nature of everything, if you make one wrong misstep, it will be assumed it is because you are incompetent, not that you misunderstood the ask or something else was the cause.",Senior Manager,Current Employee,"Chicago, IL","Feb 21, 2023"
5,3.0,Rat Race!,Smart people and great offerings. Very diverse environment which is good to see. People willing to help if you ask and if they have time.,"The Accenture system and culture is not conducive of helping new hires scale and succeed. After 2 week orientation, you get sucked into politics, everyone trying to meet their numbers and massive internal competition which can really slow you down. You either need someone to look out for you and help you as a mentor. Conflicting approach given by multiple managers you report into. Peers in sales teams seem to be part of a rat race. No help/time to understand, shadow and learn. Tuff place for newbies but hopefully once you find your home and stride..things might be different.",Sales Capture Manager,Current Employee,"San Francisco, CA","Mar 23, 2023"

8,2.0,Program not suitable for those who have coding experience and passion,The pay and work-from-home options are great for starting out in the tech field.,"They usually recruit from coding bootcamps and place you in non-coding positions or positions that rarely get exposure to any coding language. For example, my entire cohort at Accenture was placed in design or testing roles. Then, after a year of doing mindless busy work, you have to apply for other projects, but you won't be matched to or hired into any position but the ones you started with because you are matched to certain roles and get a score for your skills with the company.",Software Engineer Apprentice,Former Employee,"Austin, TX","Mar 23, 2023"
9,4.0,Great Overall But Easy To Be Overworked,100% Work from home --- Encourages constant learning / Great place to earn certifications --- Incredibly broad range of clients you can potentially work for --- Good place to build experience quickly --- Typical benefits --- Travel for work is possible,"Meeting the demands of both the client(s) and Accenture internally can put a strain on your work-life balance. They mean it when they say they encourage a healthy balance (not punished for setting boundaries), but your career progression will be quite slow unless you are overworking constantly. At least in regards to software developers, the pay is lower than you could receive elsewhere, especially if you have specialized knowledge and experience. Travel sometimes required / not optional",Business and Integration Arch Senior Analyst,Current Employee,"Nashville, TN","Mar 4, 2023"
10,2.0,Lots of marketing little substance,Good flexibility and wide variety of engagements across many solutions and industries,"They are almost exclusively turning into a sales organization rather than client value. Contracts are poorly sold, understaffed, and underbaked. What's worse is that they preach equality, sustainability, and inclusion as loud as they possibly can but my experience has been the opposite and I ran into some incredibly unprofessional and borderline discriminatory dynamics during the short time I was there (ex. leaders not knowing my name and calling me other names yet still feeling comfortable enough to submit a review on my work without consulting my direct manager for an evaluation)",Tech Strategy Consultant,Former Employee,"Chicago, IL","Mar 21, 2023"
11,4.0,Great professional experience,"If you want to learn a lot, you'll have the opportunity. People have been very friendly and supportive. All things considered, the compensation is decent. The hours aren't bad either.","If you really want to grind and put in the hours while you're young, Accenture Federal might not give you that chance, at least in my experience. It's a very comfortable career that would be a great fit for lots of people, but if you're looking to really push yourself then the corporate, lockstep promotion cycle might grate on you",S&amp;C senior analyst,Current Employe,"Washington, DC","Mar 23, 2023"
12,4.0,First job outta college. Low expectations. Lower pay.,- The work isn't very challenging and you can probably climb the ladder with a low-to-medium amount of effort. - The people are really nice and supportive. - Tons of insurance and benefit packages to choose from when you're hired.,"- Low pay. I live in a low cost of living city, and after my bills and other necessities I don't have much to save, invest, or have fun. - Boring work (but maybe it's just not for me) - Seems far behind other tech companies in terms of utilizing new / innovative technology",SAP ABAP Developer,Current Employee,"San Antonio, TX","Mar 20, 2023"

14,3.0,"Supportive, people-first environment but significantly less pay","This company has a great culture, supportive people-first management with tons of resources for career advancement, certification, and growth. If you are not happy with your current office you can apply internally to other jobs all over the US and overseas. If you're ""let go"" from your current office they'll place you ""on the bench"" with pay until you can find another office to take you.","Accenture knows it has a great culture and employee support so it can pay you significantly less than the competition. Since the type of work it conducts is mostly B2B and gov't contracts, it is constantly looking to cut costs to win bids. When asking for a raise it can be an immense struggle, almost like shopping for a car at a dealership.",Analyst,Current Employe,"Austin, TX","Mar 6, 2023"
15,4.0,Disappointing Practices,For the most recent years the company has boasted about their focus on their people and how well they treat them. This has been true.,"When other big name, multi national corporations were transparent when they let a lot of people go...Accenture did it small waves but essentially let a very large portion of the US workforce go, keeping it out of the news.",Program Manager,Former Employee,"Chicago, IL","Mar 19, 2023"

I have been a fresh-out-of-college analyst, a consultant, a rehire and a senior manager at this company and my experience is overall positive and I generally recommend it.","This is less a con, and more just the nature of things. In the Consulting arm of the business the career progression can be cutthroat, sometimes opaque, and experiences at the firm can be very different from person to person. It is not for everyone, but it is great for certain people at certain times in their lives. I recommend talking to someone who works at Accenture candidly if you can.",Senior Manager,Former Employee,"Houston, TX","Mar 7, 2023"

It's definitely not mandatory though.","It does feel like you are stranded on an island, especially if you are on the bench (in between roles) But if you stay communicating with people and doing trainings it all balances out.

I'm a Software Engineer. 

In the nearly two years I've worked for Accenture, I've only gotten to work on a relevant role for 1 month. 

The remaining time was spent working on irrelevant, extremely boring projects, performing tasks far below my skill level - which did not enable me to improve the skills I am passionate about.

Between projects, we are expected to find roles on our own. If we don't find a role quickly enough, we're shoehorned into another irrelevant, boring project.

Finding roles to fill is not the hard part, there are tons of them available. The hard part is getting the POCs for those roles to even bother responding to you.

There are very cool sides of Accenture that are worth joining -- Accenture Digital, Fjord, Accenture Interactive.","Long time's spent on the ""bench"", waiting to get called on projects. You would wait 3/4 months waiting for a project, but interviewing for new projects. Management gives no clear guidelines for skills you should be picking up to make it easier to get slotted for projects. In my starting vlass, most analysts were given projects where they mostly sat all day and did nothing.

Projects and Roles are found via interview process. You need to interview internally at shipper for roles, creating a lord of the flies type situation. Where everyone is competing, and networking all the time to get the best roles. But when you find a good role and are accepted for the role, you would often times be pulled from the project last minute because an MD had a 'pet-analyst' they were looking out for and would staff them instead.

The guidance was very unclear and unstructured. Projects are sold to internal employees as HL strategy projects, but are mostly copy-paste implementation solutions for SAP, Oracle, Salesforce, etc. Moreover, it's downright impossible to get off of projects, you could be stuck for 6-12 months in a clerical role.

502,1.0,Very Shady and  Sketchy Company Culture,"Opportunity to work at client companies such as Google, Facebook...etc. 
(or you could also be forced into working at a client that is undesirable)","- Very Shady and Sketchy Company Culture both toward employees and toward clients 

- accenture (HR) forces employees to sign documents to give up their benefits rights, and most employees don't even realize that they are signing (the document was dressed as something else), as this is also against the law, we had to file official complaint to the city government to get things fix.

- Shady, impolite middle management team (mostly indians), with no integrity;  treats employees like slaves, employees are constantly treated with no manner, and with no respect.

- Employees constantly being asked to work overtime after work hours (another employee said he was held at client site past 11pm daily) and sometimes even on weekends, while denied any rightful compensation that was supposedly promised (his was told by his manager to log in the system he never work over-time). 
- Every time I was at the accenture office, i just hear multiple different employees complain about their poor treatment by the company or at their project. 

- Although, it was communicated that employees have the choice to accept or decline projects, however, a lot of employees are forced into undesirable projects not at-will, and will be retaliated against if employees decline the project. 

- Company retaliates when employees brings forward issues or complaints, retaliation in every possible way (eg. denial of bonuses, fake/poor performance review regardless of actual performance) 

- accenture hides information from client, accenture has access to much of client's data, when they discovered any new source or information, they hide and withheld those info from the client for their own benefits (and these are actually client's own data), and accenture refused to share any role info to client's other vendors/contractors outside of accenture. 

- Employees are constantly reminded to up accenture's benefits as the first priority even at the expense of the client's, or even if it harms the client. 

- There are so much politics and teams would complain and escalate complaints against each other, it's a hostile environment where collaboration is difficult.

- Management Consulting of Accenture is great. I've heard good stories about that vertical. Technical Consulting is usual service organization type.
- Project can be good, bad or extremely bad, depending on the vertical you are getting into. For instance, if it is Telecommunications, then expect rude bosses, low bonuses and crappy work; Banking is good, but comes with short shelf life; Healthcare & Insurance are going to be bureaucratic but with OK work. 
- Good company to travel abroad and around
- Salaries have become competitive lately due to high attrition","- Very watered down technical environment. Leadership and upper management are mostly non-techies so learn to explain your technical problems like you are explaining a 10 years old
- Kiss up and kick down culture, especially in lower ranks (below Senior Manager levels)
- As you climb up the corporate ladder, you'd be expected to work less technically, and more on sales and RFP (proposal) work
- Against all odds, if you stay techie and do less RFP work, promotions will be few and far between
- Manager/boss is everything in Accenture. Keep him impressed.
- Accenture HRs are all powerful entities. Never. Ever. confront an HR.
- Appraisals, promotions and moderations are all fixed. Managers target who is going to be promoted and who is not, regardless of your good work. Bonuses, however, depends on your work, but in big accounts they'll be rationed.
- Middle management in tech, especially in countries like USA and UK, are mostly south asians. They have their own code of life and work. Familiarize yourself with those if you need to rise.",Senior Software Engineer,Current Employe,"Dallas, TX","Jan 21, 2022"

Also, for the people who will be joining the company soon. Something you should know is that you might get assigned to a project in a role that doesn't align w/ your title at all. If you are really passionate about what your role entails, you'll lay down the law w/ your HR partner. DO NOT let them push you into something you despise. That's how you end up leaving the company after your first year. You have to remember that they may be paid by management, but they work for you. Not the other way around. This worked really well for me, which is why I am loving it here. LOL

Also, I forgot to mention that I am on the federal side working w/ a federal client so I have no idea about the commercial side.","My only qualms are that we have no covid leave and our PTO is all lumped together. I get that the thinking in that it gives us more freedom to choose what to do with our time off. But you're actually creating a different problem. ""Is taking a sick day or a mental day more important that a vacation day?"" And 99 percent of the time I am gonna take that vacation day and disregard my health. If you want to watch out for both our mental and physical health we should at least get one additional hour in PTO.

Also, the project application and onboarding processes are kinda a mess for new joiners. B/c there is an HR rep and then there is another talent lead for the project and maybe portfolio that is looking for talent. As long as you keep your HR rep on a leash, things will work out for you.

There are times when it gets exhausting to be constantly needing to become an expert in a new thing, whether you have any interest in it or not.

585,3.0,Good but not great,"Livable salary, ability to pay my bills, support my small and growing family.
Shower you with presents, free uber eats vouchers, free Accenture gear.
Lots of fun events, meet up opportunities, did I mention free food + gifts?
Apprenticeship program is great, but hard work as expected. Worth the experience. A very good ""foot in the door"" place to start your career in the tech field.","Did not adjust salary during inflation. I wanted to change my People Lead many times but no one helped me, not even my HR partner.
Feedback is one way, there's no way to give feedback to higher ups who don't do well, this leads to power plays and blackmail.
They shower you with a lot of gifts to keep you loyal and hope you don't ask too many questions, but they don't pay you much at all.
If you want to know your actual salary, then add about $30k or way more to your Accenture salary to calculate your worth.
Project based work is stressful, you never know who you're going to work with. Some people are amazing, and some people are purely the worst. It's a rollercoaster ride for sure.
There seemed to be like an air of preppy college faux positivity and political correctness as a cover up for things that can be potentially harmful. If you can see right through it then good for you.
Take advantages of the resources and then move on to better opportunities, Accenture is not known for paying well. The apprenticeship and entry level arena is like playing Survivor, good luck.
I passed the Apprenticeship and I'm being paid $60k while there is no increase for inflation. This is a good ""foot in the door"" job. But I have to tell you all that, YOU ARE WORTH IT! And Accenture will keep you complacent with $40 UberEats voucher,  ""promote"" you with a small pay raise that's still way under market value, and a free branded sweatshirt and water bottle every few months. If you're happy with an entry level $60k salary in the tech field, then you should take it just to pay the bills, level up like crazy, apply to other companies, and negotiate 6 figure salaries. Oh yeah another con, you need to find your own project, if you are not on a project, you are considered ""benched"", so basically you are applying for jobs while you have a job.

604,1.0,Very Shady and  Sketchy Company Culture,"Opportunity to work at client companies such as Google, Facebook...etc. 
(or you could also be forced into working at a client that is undesirable)","- Very Shady and Sketchy Company Culture both toward employees and toward clients 

- accenture (HR) forces employees to sign documents to give up their benefits rights, and most employees don't even realize that they are signing (the document was dressed as something else), as this is also against the law, we had to file official complaint to the city government to get things fix.

- Shady, impolite middle management team (mostly indians), with no integrity;  treats employees like slaves, employees are constantly treated with no manner, and with no respect.

- Employees constantly being asked to work overtime after work hours (another employee said he was held at client site past 11pm daily) and sometimes even on weekends, while denied any rightful compensation that was supposedly promised (his was told by his manager to log in the system he never work over-time). 
- Every time I was at the accenture office, i just hear multiple different employees complain about their poor treatment by the company or at their project. 

- Although, it was communicated that employees have the choice to accept or decline projects, however, a lot of employees are forced into undesirable projects not at-will, and will be retaliated against if employees decline the project. 

- Company retaliates when employees brings forward issues or complaints, retaliation in every possible way (eg. denial of bonuses, fake/poor performance review regardless of actual performance) 

- accenture hides information from client, accenture has access to much of client's data, when they discovered any new source or information, they hide and withheld those info from the client for their own benefits (and these are actually client's own data), and accenture refused to share any role info to client's other vendors/contractors outside of accenture. 

- Employees are constantly reminded to up accenture's benefits as the first priority even at the expense of the client's, or even if it harms the client. 

- There are so much politics and teams would complain and escalate complaints against each other, it's a hostile environment where collaboration is difficult.

- Management Consulting of Accenture is great. I've heard good stories about that vertical. Technical Consulting is usual service organization type.
- Project can be good, bad or extremely bad, depending on the vertical you are getting into. For instance, if it is Telecommunications, then expect rude bosses, low bonuses and crappy work; Banking is good, but comes with short shelf life; Healthcare & Insurance are going to be bureaucratic but with OK work. 
- Good company to travel abroad and around
- Salaries have become competitive lately due to high attrition","- Very watered down technical environment. Leadership and upper management are mostly non-techies so learn to explain your technical problems like you are explaining a 10 years old
- Kiss up and kick down culture, especially in lower ranks (below Senior Manager levels)
- As you climb up the corporate ladder, you'd be expected to work less technically, and more on sales and RFP (proposal) work
- Against all odds, if you stay techie and do less RFP work, promotions will be few and far between
- Manager/boss is everything in Accenture. Keep him impressed.
- Accenture HRs are all powerful entities. Never. Ever. confront an HR.
- Appraisals, promotions and moderations are all fixed. Managers target who is going to be promoted and who is not, regardless of your good work. Bonuses, however, depends on your work, but in big accounts they'll be rationed.
- Middle management in tech, especially in countries like USA and UK, are mostly south asians. They have their own code of life and work. Familiarize yourself with those if you need to rise.",Senior Software Engineer,Current Employe,"Dallas, TX","Jan 21, 2022"

- All about right place, right time, right people. If you aren't where you want to be, you need to put in a lot of additional effort and hours outside of project work (networking, BD, +1's, etc).

789,4.0,Great Entry Level position and company. Would recommend!,"Working at Accenture was a great experience. It's great for people like myself who came out of college with very little connections and professional experience. You'll learn how to communicate effectively, meet deadlines, and work in a production based environment. The theory behind the work is interesting as well. Plenty of OT and opportunities to stand out as well. 

Management was great as well. Chill, understanding people who can to be firm if they need to. I was even sick quite a few times and had to take significant portions of time off and it was never held against me or really discussed. Management is also very invested in you as a professional. You get out what you put into this job, honestly.

I never advanced as predicted but I saw many coworkers get promoted and some get promoted to other teams in my short time. If you work hard, take a genuine interest in the position and work well with others, you'll skyrocket.

Lastly, I will say this job is extremely low stress unless you're just totally screwing off. I never came into work stressed out or nervous once I was trained.","The worst part about the job was the hours and it's hard to blame the company for this but more so the clients. 

For a period of time, I worked Fri-Tues from 12:30 PM-8PM. I didn't have a social life because when everyone else was off work I was working (vice-versa). Luckily, as I gained seniority, I was able to get to something more reasonable (Tues-Sat 7:30 AM-4 PM). Practically no one on the team worked M-F from 9-5 unless you were training. 

The content of the work itself can get very monotonous and I have no idea how people can focus on it for 8 hours at a desk in the office. I was work-from-home and the only thing keeping me sane often was being able to move around, grab a cup of coffee, use the bathroom.. In the professional world there's this notion that meetings are boring but at Accenture I genuinely looked forward to them because it gave me a break from the day-in and day-out.

Lastly, getting time off is difficult. Be prepared to work any and all holidays. If you're not planning on sticking around long, use your PTO!

If you can get through the hours and monotony, study and work hard, you'll move up.",Risk &amp; Payments Analyst,Former Employee,"Austin, TX","Jul 20, 2022"

900,4.0,Great Entry Level position and company. Would recommend!,"Working at Accenture was a great experience. It's great for people like myself who came out of college with very little connections and professional experience. You'll learn how to communicate effectively, meet deadlines, and work in a production based environment. The theory behind the work is interesting as well. Plenty of OT and opportunities to stand out as well. 

Management was great as well. Chill, understanding people who can to be firm if they need to. I was even sick quite a few times and had to take significant portions of time off and it was never held against me or really discussed. Management is also very invested in you as a professional. You get out what you put into this job, honestly.

I never advanced as predicted but I saw many coworkers get promoted and some get promoted to other teams in my short time. If you work hard, take a genuine interest in the position and work well with others, you'll skyrocket.

Lastly, I will say this job is extremely low stress unless you're just totally screwing off. I never came into work stressed out or nervous once I was trained.","The worst part about the job was the hours and it's hard to blame the company for this but more so the clients. 

For a period of time, I worked Fri-Tues from 12:30 PM-8PM. I didn't have a social life because when everyone else was off work I was working (vice-versa). Luckily, as I gained seniority, I was able to get to something more reasonable (Tues-Sat 7:30 AM-4 PM). Practically no one on the team worked M-F from 9-5 unless you were training. 

The content of the work itself can get very monotonous and I have no idea how people can focus on it for 8 hours at a desk in the office. I was work-from-home and the only thing keeping me sane often was being able to move around, grab a cup of coffee, use the bathroom.. In the professional world there's this notion that meetings are boring but at Accenture I genuinely looked forward to them because it gave me a break from the day-in and day-out.

Lastly, getting time off is difficult. Be prepared to work any and all holidays. If you're not planning on sticking around long, use your PTO!

If you can get through the hours and monotony, study and work hard, you'll move up.",Risk &amp; Payments Analyst,Former Employee,"Austin, TX","Jul 20, 2022"

985,5.0,Awesome company to work for,"What has kept me at Accenture 10+ years is the Opportunities they offer. As a global company, there is always something new. Your project can change much more often than other companies, and that keeps me challenged & continuously learning. I have been able to accumulate tons of experience, all with the same company. They look for similar skills that can be applied in different areas, which allows for that growth. Most companies will not do that, and expect you to have exact experience to try new roles/areas. But with that old school methodology, you'd essentially have to start at the bottom with any change of industry. At Accenture they look for the likenesses they can apply for you to be successful in the new role, which is quite different. I also love their initiatives and engagement events aimed towards Inclusiveness & Diversity. It's a real thing at our company, and I see the programs and the initiatives to push for equal opportunity.","The con's that people may see with our company are the immense amount of learnings required. Accenture is very big on continuous learning and ensuring their employees are up to date on Technology and the 'next big thing', like AI and Block Chain. That may not be a priority for everyone in the world and that may not fit well with a person's mind set when looking for a job. But it's important for all of us to stay relevant in our industry and we know we have to continuously grow with our skills and ideas.

The analyses required for this job are quite simple, so there's not much room for growth to gain additional transferrable skills, but its worth learning on your own to improve your own analyses.

Accenture demands your networking skills, your weekend hours, and part of your sanity.

1167,4.0,A Great Place to Start Your Career,"-Accenture offers competitive pay and benefits relative to the industry standard. It has great and talented employees that really do care for one another. 
- They offer extensive resources to broaden career horizons, and there are plenty of areas within the firm to explore different clients, industries, and technologies. Self training options are limitless and there are plenty of areas to grow.
- The people truly are great to work with. Managers care about their employees and look out for younger employees on client projects. It’s an incredibly large firm so there are plenty of networking opportunities.","- You need to be prepared to work. This isn’t a place where the bare minimum cuts it. Expect to work overtime often if you’re in a client facing role (which most are). I’m currently in a role that has me billing roughly 60hrs weekly. OT is not given above the Analyst level either. 
- I feel HR does a bad job (this is my largest critique). They’re flaky and unresponsive at times, yet when they need you to complete action items they have no problem hounding you for a response. The turnover in HR is pretty high and it seems most employees get a different HR Partner every few months. They’re mostly there to protect the firm from any lawsuits.",Tech arch delivery analyst,Current Employe,"Pittsburgh, PA","Aug 11, 2021"
1168,5.0,Awesome company to work for,"What has kept me at Accenture 10+ years is the Opportunities they offer. As a global company, there is always something new. Your project can change much more often than other companies, and that keeps me challenged & continuously learning. I have been able to accumulate tons of experience, all with the same company. They look for similar skills that can be applied in different areas, which allows for that growth. Most companies will not do that, and expect you to have exact experience to try new roles/areas. But with that old school methodology, you'd essentially have to start at the bottom with any change of industry. At Accenture they look for the likenesses they can apply for you to be successful in the new role, which is quite different. I also love their initiatives and engagement events aimed towards Inclusiveness & Diversity. It's a real thing at our company, and I see the programs and the initiatives to push for equal opportunity.","The con's that people may see with our company are the immense amount of learnings required. Accenture is very big on continuous learning and ensuring their employees are up to date on Technology and the 'next big thing', like AI and Block Chain. That may not be a priority for everyone in the world and that may not fit well with a person's mind set when looking for a job. But it's important for all of us to stay relevant in our industry and we know we have to continuously grow with our skills and ideas.

In my particular situation, it's nice to be able to work globally and remotely. I get to meet really cool people and work on some cool stuff. The pay is good and the benefits are solid.","There can be too many moving parts and often times this leads to things being overlooked. There's also a lot of growth happening so you have to kind of find your own way most of the time and since I was just thrown into an entirely new role, this is challenging. Especially since it's a role that I didn't plan to move into. Management hasn't been very helpful with the transition either because they are all hyper-focused on the process changes and I'm not looped into those conversations at all, so I'm on my own.

Being told I was getting one role for months --> then hearing we didn't have the budget for the new role --> hearing there's another role with equitable compensation that I can move into and then seeing the original role given to a coworker was disheartening and really damaged my perception of how Accenture values it's people.

Great Benefits - Some of the best and low cost benefits in the world

Job Security - If you do your job, you'll never lose it.

Government Clearance & Experience - You'll likely work on a contract for a government entity, and likely need some level of security clearance which is great on your resume and for future endeavors","Lower Pay Potential for ""Working class""- Unless you move into management here, it's no secret, you can make more money working for a private contractor.

1279,1.0,Overcrowded body shopping company in it's core with posh appearance and luxury talks,"* If you want to enjoy easy life, get decent pay, can sugar coat everything you say, be polite to Sr. Management, do what you're told.. then this is THE PLACE to be. Accenture will be a paradise for you. Stay here and retire with lots of benefits like discounted company shares, 401K etc. etc. 

* If you know how to work 'smart'. Be in the right place at the right time in front of right people and take the credits, you will go to senior management and leadership. Once you become Sr. Manager, your life is set. You have no targets, no obligations to fulfill. You can literally spend you days at the beach for next 10 years and retire with fantastic savings and benefits by the end of your career. But to get there, you have to do a lot of course!","I am obviously sharing my personal view and my perspective after working for 7 years here. I am writing things being unbiased and true to my heart: 

* In it's core, Accenture is a service-based, head-count based, body-shopping company with posh appearances and luxury talks about technology, data analytics, machine learning, automation and AI.

* At high level, Accenture is a company led by a CEO who clearly is a misandrist or more accurately, a female chauvinist. I'm all for gender equality. However, you can't penalize hard-working, talented, motivated men in the name of women empowerment. She did that and it simply created a toxic environment. Her new policies have caused a lot of friction and insubordination in every team across the org. Her impulsive and pre-matured decisions while making new policies clearly lacking proper strategy will cost everyone sailing in this gigantic, over-crowded ship. Not only employees but also their families suffer due to her recent changes.

* For talented, growth oriented, career focused people, know that Accenture is filled with old, tired, lethargic, non-upgraded leaders who are full of politics and ride their high horses. They are neither result-oriented nor growth oriented. They get their fat bonus and company shares and are happy playing golf on weekends.

* It's an over-crowded chaos. (700K+ employees worldwide). You being the primary controller of your destiny is a far fetched idea. 

* 5% of people are those who actually work and earn the bread for the company and 80% are unproductive leads, Managers, Sr. Managers, leaderships, HR overheads, process facilitators, talent specialists, travel agents etc.. who do less than a post-man and just send e-mails from end point to other. Yes. They'll take credit for sure. Rest 15% are floating pool who keep getting hired (with anticipation of new projects) and fired (when the new projects aren't signed)

* Heavily hit by recent attrition trend. I'm not kidding but literally there are more managers than workers. Work of 1 person is showcased by 10 people as 'their' work in 10 different places. 1 person had one career-counsellor manager, one project manager, HR manager and one people manager and sometimes an onshore and offshore manager! So totally 4 to 5 managers for 1 worker! This is REALITY. I am not joking. You are better off free-lancing than being here. At least there, you will be in control of your actions and consequences. 

* Company talks about 'equality' but higher positions get business class treatment and lower position gets economy class treatment. Lower positions are shown their place even for basic social necessities like health insurance. A senior official who can afford more gets higher coverage for less cost but a fresher gets less coverage for high premium! So much for equality! 

* All in all, it's a good pit-stop destination if you're a fresher. If you are serious about learning and growing, stay away. It's a TRAP. Once you spend more than 3 years here, you are stuck for lifetime! You won't be up-to market standards and won't have latest skills and hence can't jump this toxic org. 
 
* Special mention to senior managers from 'Indian-origin' and their hierarchical, age-old mindset of boot polishing!. I would stay as far away as possible. They bring poor people from third world countries to the US with high aspirations and promises, suck the life out of them and use them until they can take the 'credits' but also expect them to be 'grateful'. They are thrown away if they ever ask for good bonus, fair rewards or recognition. (of course like any other IT company). So, most of the people you would interact on a daily basis are passive aggressive, stressed, poor, low-self-esteem people who are probably struggling with a side hustle along with their full-time job. You would initially get a over-humble response but later regret being in this org. (happens all the time in every project) 

* Basically, everyone I've met here is unhappy. But they put up a big smile cuz they have to!. They have given a part of their life for accenture and now they want to sit back, relax, attend meetings, talk about their cute dogs and exotic cuisine and have their pay-checks coming. So, imagine your fate if you actually want to learn and grow! 

* Diversity is highly advertised but followed only on postures and bill boards. Institutional racism is clearly visible and felt but of-course as it happens to only non-privileged people, everyone would say it's not real and just a mind-set.

* If you are in the US, if you're an out-sider, you get condescended by the locals. If you're a local, you get to work with people who know nothing about US life or work culture. It's a thorn with pointy end on both sides! 

* The list goes on if I have to rant and nit pick; bottom line is. In every service-based org, your experience and luck depends on what kind of project and which team you'll end up after a year or 2. 
Sometimes it can be good but most of the time, with a mammoth sized org which keeps acquiring new orgs and builds toxic work culture, it's not good for talented people.

- When travel was a thing, I viewed it as a perk most of the time (free vacations with the points), however it can absolutely be a hassle. Probably depends on your stage in life. 
- Worked with a lot of very smart, very polished people, which has helped me grow.
- Tons of opportunities to grow your skillsets through training, certifications, and continuing education 
- Lots of PTO (5 weeks at manager level)
- Work with some seriously interesting or big name companies. Pretty much all of the Fortune 500 uses Accenture","- Career growth is luck of the draw, meaning you have to be available for the right role on the right project at the right time. Case and point: had 4 review cycles of glowing reviews, many people supporting promotion (360 deg. reviews), however it was never good enough because the role wasn't quite right or the project with the wrong group or some other movement of the goal posts.
- Compared to the Bay Area tech companies that I was helping, the comp is not competitive. In 4 years, my base salary increased by a measly $10k and the bonus is not something to count on being sizable ($5-10k on average). All you can do is laugh when you see the bill rates they charge for your time vs the salary you're paid.
- No surprise, but burnout is a real thing in the consulting world. Bad sales deals translate to crazy deadlines, travel, and working with offshore teams will take eventually its toll on you. Guaranteed. 
- Don't hit the bench. I would go 9 months staffed 100% and within 2 weeks would start feeling the pressure to accept any billable role, which of course perpetuates the issue of not being in the right role to justify promotion.

1344,2.0,"Analysts forced onto call center projects, staffing is stressful, generally unsustainable","- Name recognition when you exit
- Exposure to lots of industries if you want","I was one of the analysts onboarded straight into an unemployment call center despite them telling me I had time to shop around for ""real"" projects. It was literally a call center, and we worked 5am-2pm with 2 15's and a lunch break. It was for a big state that was extremely understaffed. It was very, very emotionally taxing work speaking with people who were struggling and were not receiving adequate support. Not to mention the details of the work itself - long story short, we were there as damage control honestly. We weren't allowed to execute any of the actual tasks to get people access to benefits. 

A lot of (understandably) frustrated callers would curse us out over the phone, and we were constantly praised by Accenture leadership for being willing to do this ""difficult work"" - I appreciate that, but this was not what I signed up for, and that should be noted. I don't need or want to be positioned as a martyr making some sacrifice against my will, so that the company can honor contracts. Did I mention, I even saw some managers and people returning from leave also dragged into this project because they were unstaffed for just a moment? It became a thing to take literally any project to try to roll off the call center. That's not really fulfilling consulting's promise of short term, variety pack, cross-functional, sexy strategy work. 

In addition, there was a lot of politics within this project - earlier roll off dates were promised and then revoked, regional leadership was at odds about which analysts should be staffed on something like this, I'd ask a very pointed question during a project town hall (that everyone wanted answered) and be completely ignored, etc. Even worse, so many people outside of the call center projects were completely unaware of this whole thing, as if it was kept under wraps because of the negativity. They'd ask me ""what's the call center?"" and then usually give me a long-winded tale of ""doing your time,"" helping out the company, and it all paying off eventually. It made my peers and I feel very unseen and used. 

This 5 month long ordeal ruined my idea of Accenture, and in the following projects I had, I realized that this is not where I want to be. Outside of the call center, I noticed a lot of groups have similar tendencies of using analysts under the guise of doing your time, and earning your place at the company. I don't want to be anywhere where entry level employees are disposable. I got out halfway through my analyst program because it is not worth it. (And better environments and companies that pay well are out there.)

Also consider the staffing process here - you staff yourself. At Bain and other places, someone staffs you. It's honestly stressful to staff yourself. Don't believe it when people say it gives you independence - I'd honestly value having someone to just staff me, especially when being unstaffed could lead to you being thrown onto surge work (call centers, etc). It's actually really hard to get staffed on something you actually want unless you have an unlimited social battery to network and want to work 4 extra hours a day on top of your current project for ""business development,"" aka unchargeable busywork because someone sold an understaffed project to undercut another company.

If you're still reading this, maybe you're thinking - that's not that bad, there is worse work out there. That's true! That doesn't make this experience good. Or that I obviously was not cut out for consulting, and I chose the wrong job. That's also true! But I don't think anyone really should think that they need this consulting line on their resume so much that they are forced on emotionally taxing projects with no way out, gaslit about their ""duty"" as an analyst, feel behind their peers because of this totally random assignment, and endure this kind of stress about where they work. 

I think there are better consulting companies out there if that's what you want - places where you can at least feel valued, even if you do have to work long hours. Or places that don't accept these kinds of contracts that make you question what kind of role you are playing in society.",Senior Strategy Analyst,Former Employee,"San Francisco, CA","Feb 8, 2022"

-Several poor mentalities i.e. ""Square peg in round hole"", ""toxic cliques""
-It's TOO big, everyone is a number...except for people in the cliques
-Dog eat dog without realizing it: Collaboration is very important to meet success. Working with others can still lead to overshadowing if not careful. And if you have great ideas around the wrong people, they may steal those ideas and use it in their recognition, even promotion stories
-Poor compensation, especially for People of Color (PoC), and unless you know Managers and Directors that care enough to vouch for you, it can be a struggle to receive proper compensation
-Good leadership is few and far in-between. Leadership will have no clue, look to their team members, and take credit as if they came up with approaches and ideas
-Manager/Lead accountability at the project-level can be abysmal. Especially if things go wrong
-Micro-management can be extreme depending on who you work with
-If you're an introvert, even with a lot to offer, it will be a struggle. Accenture is quick to put down certain mindsets, instead of empowering
-Can instill a fear of despite all the good you can accomplish, it's not enough

1546,5.0,Amazing company doing amazing things,"There is tremendous growth opportunity in your discipline as well as in other disciplines. There are great tools that allow everyone to see openings/demand within Accenture and anyone who meets the requirements, can apply.

There are lots of learning opportunities through elearning that you can take advantage of whenever you have availability. There are recommended learnings based on your role and you can also do others based on your need. 

The work environment is very upbeat with lots of open areas to meetup, chat, connect. There are also onsite learning opportunities that are hosted by various special interest groups (these are all employees in volunteer-led groups). There are also several special interest groups and topics that you can subscribe to based on your preference. There's a lot if you have a desire to learn, contribute, volunteer, etc. This is how you connect with others and learn about potential client opportunities where you may be a good fit.

Accenture, being one of the global leading Management & Technology Consulting firms, it has to continuously strive to be up-to-speed with the latest trends as well as predict the future trends - their clients expect this. It is an exciting environment to be part of. I miss all of the above.

 

In general, I felt that there is tons of opportunity to grow, develop and contribute to the work environment. There's so much that this can easily distract you from your core role. I had to consciously hold back as I was getting involved in too many groups, etc., but this is such a great problem to have.","It is important to network and connect with people to land on your preferred projects. Early on, while you are relatively new, it can be tough to connect with the right groups, etc. which can result in ""sitting on the bench"".
My opinion is for Accenture to help new hires connect with the right folks who could hep in this regard. I was an experienced hire coming in as a Sr. Manager. For most employees who have come-up through the ranks, by the time they are a Sr. Manager, they already have their networks at this stage.

1547,5.0,"Great place to build a career, great people","The people, culture, and core values of Accenture are why I stayed for so many years.

A lot of senior people are genuine and good role models for others. Has gotten better over the years at encouraging some level of work-life balance for employees. Great benefits for women, and big focus on DE&I. Constantly reinventing itself and trying to stay ahead of the market, which creates many opportunities for employees.","Less flexibility/more difficult for individuals to move across organizational areas within the company or to work globally. Historically, Accenture has also not been as good at re-skilling smart people/high performers when demand shifts to new areas. I believe they are trying to change this. As the company has grown to 500,000+ it is becoming less personal to employees, and sometimes decisions seem very arbitrary.

*Various training and networking events occur regularly. Additional training tools exist for improving skills.

*From a Software Engineering perspective, the tech stacks for most projects seem to be very current, but there's a lot of variance depending on team and project. 

*Supportive Management that is invested in the mentorship and overall success of new employees. Though this will vary by team.

*Not *too* much room to negotiate base salary, but generous sign on and relocation bonuses are available if you push for them. If you're awarded only one of these ask for the other. 

*Junior Software Engineers (level 10 and below) are eligible for overtime compensation, which is extremely rare at other companies.","*Internal Communication within a team is usually strong but cross team collaboration can be difficult due to both the size and bureaucracy of Accenture and the Federal Government.

*ERG and social functions seem to be limited at this time. I relocated to DC for this job and was hoping for the opportunity to network and meet new people through Accenture, but so far I have not heard from any of the ERG's that I joined regarding events or meetups, and the only account meeting that I was interested in did not follow through with scheduling its social fitness event.

*Post COVID remote work strategy has not been clearly communicated. This is harder to determine at AFS specifically, since projects that require access to confidential information cannot be performed remotely, but return to work policies have not been clearly communicated and a timeline for when that will be decided hasn't been revealed either.
