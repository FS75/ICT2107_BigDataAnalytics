5.0,"A potentially brilliant job, if you’re lucky.","The retail stores have a friendly and surprisingly low pressure sales environment that, when it works, nurtures the employee into finding better ways at upselling than being pushy, rather than berating for their figures.

However progression really depends on which store you work at, and then can depend on how loud your personality is. My first store showed good signs for progression with a broad set of personalities in supervisory or senior roles. However, moving stores I found reset any progression the company perceived you to have made, even when moving was due to my disability and financial status. I also found other store to seem to prefer louder personalities in supervisory roles, which put my developing self at an impasse for progression.

In the end (7yrs no progression) I saw numerous long tenure figures with no opportunity to progress forced to leave due to lack of opportunities, not to mention the seeming lack of preparation for a loss of such experienced staff at local levels.",,,Operations Specialist,Former Employee,Birmingham,"March 21, 2023"

It's not perfect, but it is a place I'm proud to work for. In terms of an advisor role, not a lot of difference from other WFH call centers, metrics have to be met, calls are reviewed.......

5.0,Intern,"Overall very positive view, i was working as an intern at Apple and really liked both the work and the environment. Learned a lot throughout my tenure.",,,Intern,Former Employee,Beijing,"March 13, 2023"
4.0,"Demanding client facing role, it is what you make of it!","Apple is a internationally known trillion dollar company, so of course there are pros and cons to working for them. The wages and benefits are highly competitive and make it really hard to want to leave. Depending on what store you work at the culture can either be the best or the worst part of the job. On the sales floor [not the genius bar] customers are generally nice and excited about getting a new product and open to hearing your recommendations and expertise. You truly do make so many great connections both with customers and coworkers and meet all kinds of interesting people. Micromanaging could be considered an issue. However, the drive for results is mostly based on expectations from higher-ups as it is with most sales driven roles. Growth and development is challenging and if you are looking to “move up“ then prepare to go through many phases of interviews. Those who are outgoing and energetic are typically favoured over those who are not. All in all Apple can be a very fun and exciting place to work if you don’t let numbers and the pressure get to you.",,,Product Zone Specialist,Current Employee,"Toronto, ON","March 13, 2023"

5.0,I love it and Miss it,"Work was steady and constant. And all jobs will have their ups and downs. But its one of the few jobs I miss more than just the people.

I miss the culture, I miss the way they approached providing service and care in person differently than last phone places I had worked. And developed my skills from sales into realizing I was an untapped technical mentor. And continued building me in those strengths until I had to leave due to work live balance requiring me home in the evenings onward.

3.0,Be wary,"Apple retail can be a very unhealthy workplace. Micro managed to an unbelievable degree. I would describe the experience like a behaviour modification exercise. The whole environment is seemingly , favoured toward extroversion. Most glaring at my time there was the lack of diversity in management. Which a customer had pointed out to me. If you are a certain personally type who can drink the kool aid, you will not thrive.",,,Specialist,Former Employee,"Calgary, AB","March 6, 2023"
2.0,Our Soul is Our Profits,"If you enjoy micromanagement, better than average pay, abusive customers, decent benefits, insane working hours, and expectation to work with at least 3 customers at once while harassing them about every single service, then apple is for you.

4.0,It’s apple,Self explanatory but I think it’s a great opportunity for people to learn how the world operates and what it means to be able to help a person who has issues and that the main goal is to make sure that everyone is happy and helped out entirely and not be overwhelmed with rushing things and things get frustrating for everyone in the working class because it’s life.

4.0,"Great job, except for management sometimes","Lots of learning especially if you don't already know much about Apple products and services. One nice thing is that we don't really have to deal with the angry customers, the leads and managers will. I think the main issue with management is an obsession with store statistics - there's constant hassling about different products or services - other team members agree and say that almost all of our management is toxic. The most enjoyable part of the job was how friendly and willing to help most team members are - asking questions and helping each other out is common. Great benefits and discounts!",,,Specialist,Former Employee,"Burlingame, CA","February 21, 2023"

4.0,Great job for students but management makes it feel like high school,"Pays well, great benefits, flexible schedule. Very lenient place to work which respects your life outside of work. Very difficult to get fired unless you really mess up.

The only real deterrent is management. They are essentially tenured and managers tend to form cliques. Because of this, it's sometimes hard to get promoted/apply to different in-house positions since they reserve it for their favorite subordinates. A lot of the times it feels like a popularity contest. You can say that it's just office politics but it really feels like high school.",,,Specialist,Former Employee,"Montréal, QC","February 18, 2023"

Very communicative with changes happening in the store. Benefits are really good, and the pay is very good comparing to many other companies.

5.0,Challenging but worth the work in the end.,"For anyone who's worked in retail, by a certain point, you know the ins and outs of most retail companies and how they operate. Apple always stood out to me, in terms of how it feels working in the stores. They give you far more autonomy and freedom than typical for the field.

3.0,It's still a major corporation,"Apple's a pretty easy job overall. There are options if you want to get involved outside of your regular day to day duties. The culture definitely varies store to store but it's a pretty welcoming environment. It's still retail though and it gets very draining. Work life balance isn't always the best because of the way shifts are set up and we absolutely aren't paid enough compared to how much the company makes. Management could be better and they tend to not like to take some customer concerns. In general, it's one of the best options if you can get in if you want to work retail but moving up is difficult and can take a few years.","Really good benefits, pay","Retail stress, performative action when it comes to supporting retail workers",Operations Specialist,Current Employee,"Chicago, IL","February 9, 2023"

4.0,"Not Great, Not Terrible","Typical day was always interesting because you never knew what kind of calls were going to come in. The biggest issue is I had managers who would not recognize me getting 100 calls that all gave me gleaming reviews, and then you get the one angry person whos going to review you poorly no matter what, and then the managers would focus only on that and treat me like I wasn't doing the job correctly.

Then, my GM wanted to be closer to home so a new one came in and they managed to ruin my workday, siting poor performance while not training (poor performance being not enough cards). All around created a poor work environment himself and a majority of people they hired after that. If you get a good manager, can be a very fulfilling and fun place to work.

The company values diversity, and encourages its employees to be themselves and bring their unique perspectives to work.

On the negative side, Apple is also known for its strict corporate culture and high expectations, which can be demanding for some employees. The company's rapid pace of innovation and frequent product launches can also lead to long hours and tight deadlines.

Overall, working at Apple can be a great opportunity for individuals who are passionate about technology, design, and innovation, and who are willing to work hard to contribute to the company's success.",Design excellence,Strict corporate culture,Software Developer,Current Employee,München,"January 31, 2023"

Quotas are starting to become unattainable with zero insight on how they are created although it's been asked to expose this from the reps. There are TWO CRMs being used with duplication of the same records to be inputted taking up time.

2.0,Work somewhere else,Working from home was great. They had plenty of opportunity to network virtual. Some even got the opportunity to travel onsite. Scheduling is terrible. You will never have a weekend off. You are required to work one weekend day. Scheduling bidding is never really explained. After several years of service you can still end up with the most ridiculous schedule. They are laying off work from because they want you to move to one of their call centers.

3.0,Retail is retail.,"Retail, for everybody, is probably the worst kinda job out there. Working at Apple Retail is the best of the worst.

Pros:
• good pay compared to other retailers.
• coworkers got your back, and the managers, for the most part, are very supportive when it comes to customer-facing conflicts.
• benefits are crazy, discounts on Apple products are the best employee-discounts I've seen.

cons:
• if you want a promotion, or want to be noticed, you have to meet a quota, just like retail. you have to make sure you're selling iphones with applecare. that's all they care about. they WILL NOT keep you if you do not meet these standards, otherwise you're just another seasonal to them. I left because of this.
• you will meet the most obnoxious, self-righteous, and snobby customers in your life when you work there. because of this, it's probably one of the most stressful retail jobs because you're working for a big company and customers' products and data are very sensitive.
• absolutely no WLB. as a temporary/seasonal employee, you have to work on the weekends, plus any two weekdays. it's usually always slammed, and as a seasonal you'll be thrown the worst shifts (1-10p, 2-11p). If you have school, do not try to work here. My store manager forced my coworker to choose either school or work.
• coworkers can be great, but some will not want to be your friend at all. they want the promotion as bad as everybody else, so it can result in a toxic work environment.",,,Specialist,Former Employee,"Glendale, CA","January 17, 2023"
2.0,"Great Benefits, but no support.",I have worked for them for 2 years. They are not progressive enough. Anyone that wants to WFH is pushed out and given ultimatums. Leadership was terrible.,,,Annotation Analyst,Current Employee,"San Diego, CA","January 17, 2023"

4.0,Fine if you are a people person,"I was a seasonal specialist. It was fine. Pay was the most I had had to that point. There were sales quotas, which is annoying. No one NEEDS an apple watch.

5.0,Best work experience by far.,Plenty of opportunities to explore new roles and learn new skills. Benefits are great. Interviews are tough. Interview technique was the biggest thing holding me back. But I’ve learned so much.,,,Genius,Current Employee,"San Francisco, CA","January 13, 2023"
3.0,Controlled chaos,"Great benefits, middling pay, absolutely physically and mentally grueling.

The Operations team (or “Backstage”) is so behind-the-scenes that leadership tends not to notice you. This makes it difficult to move up in the company, as even extremely good metrics will prompt them to ask for more. The physical demands of the job left me in pain after nearly every shift.

(And at the end of the day, it’s still retail, so don’t bother trying to develop normal sleep patterns.)",,,Operations Specialist,Former Employee,"Irvine, CA","January 12, 2023"

2.0,2 stars,"What is the best part of working at the company?
The benefits are golden.

What is the most stressful part about working at the company?
Total lack of opportunity unless you are willing to pack up and move to either Austin, TX or North Carolina. Overall direction of the support side of the company changes radically every four or five months. Most team managers have little to zero front line experience.

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?
It’s great if you work at the main campus. If you are in retail or AppleCare, you are nothing more than meat. Just a butt in a seat. Mgmt has zero respect for front-line hourly employees.

What is a typical day like for you at the company?
I worked in support over social media channels. One any given day I might have been writing or editing Twitter responses or working with power users in the old user forums.",,,Social Response Advisor/Moderator,Former Employee,"Austin, TX (Remote, I’m in Las Vegas, NV)","January 11, 2023"

5.0,Good,"Apple's benefits are unmatched. No matter the appointment, I never had to pay a copay and rarely ever got bills in the mail. I now work at a Fortune 500 publicly traded company, and the insurance is mid compared to Apple's. The call-off and leave time policies and procedures are quick and easy.
Managers rarely reached out when I called in, and that made me feel like it was okay to have a life outside of my desk.
With AAPL being such a large international company, the room for growth is there, but don't expect to immediately get an executive level promotion.
As with any large company, some bad Apples slip through. My first manager was an angel. My last one - not at all.
Pay could be better.. I started at $15 as an advisor and 2 years later I was at about $18-20.",,,At Home Advisor,Former Employee,Michigan,"January 11, 2023"

My role to bring designs to life and into mass production meant we were often up against marketing forecasts and project budgets that made the work more difficult. Its extremely fast paced and if you are not able to create boundaries, learn the word ""no"" or ask for help, its easy to get overwhelmed. However it is a one of kind company that can teach you so much about drive, determination, problem solving, perseverance, etc that will likely spill over into other areas of your life.","Fabulous colleagues, ability to do crazy things in unreasonable timelines, beautiful campus.

We answered questions and troubleshot issues with people's phones, computers, iPads, and accounts. Apple made the work fairly easy with step-by-step articles to resolve about 99% of people's issues.
That kind of work can be stressful for some people as you're usually dealing with angry customers.

Apple provided great scheduling options with 5x8 and 4x10 schedules. They worked with your class schedule, had great pay, and probably the best benefits of any job i've heard of.

Creative and high level of innovation are true to Apple's company culture. In addition, the company always try to make a positive impact everything she touches. I worked for Apple for 10+ years and have been rooted in those values. I left Apple for 5 years now because Apple has lost my love and trust. Promotion in the company was hard, but I had a few throughout my career. Favoritism with managers played a stronger role in your promotion than your ability. Because I worked for Apple for so long, I witnessed the quality of managers declined significantly.

I learned from my boss (The executive pastry chef). How to elevate my still , technique , use the metric system in order to cost out our labor and production to the penny.

2.0,"Coworkers were great. Management, not so much","I loved most of the individuals I worked with at Apple, but management has a large disconnect from their employees. Advancement and development was strictly at will of what upper management wanted. Upper management did not care what the employees want to do unless it is in direct alignment with their desires. Upper Management would rather individuals suffer and be miserable than to allow them any opportunity to succeed in their role or their lives.

4.0,Really fun but taxing,"Overall Apple is a great company to work for. They definitely take care of their employees but it is a mentally taxing job. There are opportunities for growth but it’s really difficult to move up in roles because of competition within and outside the store. Management can also be wishy washy and unsupportive at times, but they also do their best. You have to learn who to go to and how to play the game if you need something done. They work with you and your availability but with corporate doing the scheduling and managers not having any power to change your schedules, you will often times get scheduled outside your availability based on company needs. It can be a tough job depending on what you do and how busy your store gets, but the coworkers and benefits definitely make it worth it.",,,Sales Specialist,Current Employee,"Los Angeles, CA","December 10, 2022"

Didn’t get my pay for over a month. Couldn’t hear trainer because of loud employees on lunch.

The pay was very poor but the benefits, such as reimbursed gym membership and dental, were excellent.

There were no incentives and no commission, despite me personally selling millions of pounds worth of Apple products per year.

Pay rises were minimal (less than £500 per annum) and progression was blocked by certain managers. I was personally told that I wasn't ""Appley enough"" for a promotion. At the time, I was top in sales and customer satisfaction. Every manager signed off on me applying for the promotion. Customers would ask to see me and bring me gifts as a thank you for my honesty and assistance.

Managers would force you to share gifts with everyone else. I always thought that was a little bit odd. I can't share a cupcake with everyone! Haha.",Collaboration. Frequent free lunches.

2.0,long hours,"Long hours, pay is okay. customer satisfaction survey is unrealistic.

4.0,"Great Team, Unclear progression. High expectations","First things first the people you work with on the shop floor will be the nicest, most interesting people you ever work with.

5.0,Great overall experience at the BCC store,"Worked at apple for a total of 4 years! In general it’s a great company to work for, the health insurance benefits are so good for even part-time employees. It’s probably one of the easiest retail stores to work at for sure.",,,Specialist,Former Employee,"Miami, FL","November 11, 2022"
4.0,Remote contract work was awesome besides the pay,"Overall the job was great working remote was awesome and we did a lot of cool stuff. Only problem was the staffing company, who was hard to get ahold of at times and somewhat exaggerated the potential to move into a full time role. Biggest issue was the low pay rate and inability to get a raise even after years in the position. I would have loved to stay if I could have even gotten a cost of living adjustment after 3+ years. Seems they would rather constantly train new people instead of paying people who perform well to stick around.",,,GIS Analyst,Former Employee,Remote,"November 11, 2022"
2.0,Busy but very stressful,"No work/life balance. Pays better than most retail jobs but as a tech not paid enough for all we have to do.
Management gaslighting and clear favoritism for advancement. People aren’t hired for their skills anymore. All the new techs have no technical experience or understanding of troubleshooting even after training. They only template match.

4.0,Fun and with good pay and benefits but with a catch.,"If you need a good paying job with great benefits and decent flexibility this is your place! So far I have worked in two different locations (one in NYC the other out of state). Your experience will vary depending on your market. At my previous location out market leader made everything as transactional as possible and metrics were of the upmost importance. If you were not selling X, Y, and Z then you were not doing a good job. To clarify, Apple employees DO NOT work on commission. It is an hourly pay job! With that said, depending on your reviews (customers can give you reviews in their email receipts) and your metrics that does play into your compensation. So it’s not commission based but you really want to hit all of their marks to insure that you can have the best pay boost possible. My current location in NYC is better in terms of culture and what the market leader wants. It’s very easy going though the pay could definitely be higher for NYC cost of living (honestly the biggest strike I have for this location). Give it a shot! Something to try out.",,,Product Specialist/Sales Associate,Current Employee,"Upper East Side, NY","November 10, 2022"
3.0,Busy,Busy none stop! Customer are rude occasionally! Be prepared for being only judge by surveys from customers. The support from managers was the best part and keeps you going,,,Technical Support,Former Employee,Remote,"November 9, 2022"
5.0,I loved my job!,Working for Apple was the best thing I did during my time as an undergraduate. I would have stayed to grow with the company( because they encourage you to) if it was not for personal life changes. The only thing bad I can say about it is when you're placed in a position with angry customers on the call and sometimes you may not have a solution. This can happen at any call center. I learned various things there that I will keep with me throughout the remainder of my professional career. I loved working there!,,,Technical Support Advisor,Former Employee,AHA,"November 9, 2022"

4.0,"Great place to work, management dependent","Apple all in all is a great place to work. I learn so much while working there, and meet so many great people.

5.0,A great job to work from home,Loved working for this company the time I did. They also do a test before you are chosen. You will get paid good for training but there is this test at the end that will determine whether you will actually start working .,,,AppleCare Advisor,Former Employee,Remote,"November 6, 2022"
4.0,Overall great company with very good benefits,"Job is interesting at first but can get pretty repetitive and boring in the long run. This is not the kind of job you should be doing more than 2 years in my opinion. That being said, the company is pretty decent, at least for annotation analysts based in Cork Ireland. Pay is not too bad for the job, hybrid model allows you to work from home Mondays and Fridays, you can also work remotely 4 weeks every year from wherever you want in Ireland. You get nice discounts on apple products for you and your family. But the best benefit in my opinion is their medical centre which provides good service for a very small price.",,,Annotation Analyst,Current Employee,"Cork, County Cork","November 5, 2022"

4.0,"Apple Ireland great place to start l, not to progress","I started in Apple Care 4-5 years. Apple is a great company to start with, they pay well, you have great benefits and they train you to support a lot of products.

You have to work very hard to progress out from AppleCare into corporate due to the massive number of candidates fighting for limited corporate/ offline positions.

Major cons:
-Company’s unwillingness to embrace remote work
-Little progression options past senior technical specialist positions in Apple Care",,,Senior specialist,Current Employee,"Cork, County Cork","November 4, 2022"
5.0,"Great Company , great benefits, Great culture and diversity , Heavy Metrics based, High Call Volume","Apple culture is unique and very diverse. Most managers are pretty laid back but still focused on goals in a good way. Call volume is very high w/ back to back calls every 7 secs w/ rare occasions of larger breaks in between. High technical job w/ alot of multi tasking and they are heavy on metrics. Very good on work accommodations if needed and coworkers are very caring. Nice charity donation matching, great tuition assistance , 401 K, super amazing insurance rates and coverage, PTO, sick time, etc. Great learning environment with all the tools you need to learn available to you. Opportunity to advance and grow as you move along from T1 to T2 etc. Great coworkers who help you grow and great managers w/ the exception of my last manager. Under her leadership 3 of us quit including myself but my other 3 managers before her were beyond amazing. Alot of room for growth and pay is very good but sometimes feel its too little with all the brain power thats needed to troubleshoot Apple devices especially on complicated calls. Some calls are super easy versus others but you never know what kind of call you will get. Some calls are super difficult and customers can get pretty upset when their apple devices do not work. Overall its a call center type job so alot of this stuff is expected but overall I will say it was an amazing experience and outstanding company to work for.. by far the best one I ever been apart of in my opinion.",,,iOS MAC + Advisor (Remote),Former Employee,Remote,"November 4, 2022"
5.0,Great Company,"Amazing people and work-life balance. Great benefits and salary. Workmates are fantastic and supportive, a competitive environment but also highly collaborative.",,,Specialist,Current Employee,Castle Towers NSW,"November 3, 2022"
5.0,Company needs to create/save its culture,"Great brand, great people. Office structure is very rigid with WFH rules - especially since covid.. Agile way of working which is great. Tools could be better, we don't use salesfore or many saas which could seriously be useful sometimes (a bit old school). Way too many men in managerial positions it's not looking good frankly for women. High hierarchy style company, don't expect a fun and start up culture > most people are in their 40's and busy.

Culture could be better, cheap on team gatherings and fun moments, no events, not many celebrations, no budget for farewells. It's ok to not finance everything but make an effort to build more CARE in the company.",,,"Business Development, Channel Sales",Former Employee,Greater London,"November 3, 2022"

2.0,limited review,"I can’t give a lot of specific details as I still work there, but… Overworked is an understatement for chat support. Phone support is fine.

4.0,No advancement,"In the remote field working for Apple, it's almost impossible to advance. You can switch around between departments but advancing is very slim. There's almost no room to grow. In 7 years, I've had more than 7 managers. I've had managers just hired that didn't really know about a department, managers that were amazing and supportive and managers that were just careless. They have great benefits and the pay is fare but raises are almost nothing so after a few years you don't really see a difference in pay. Schedules are picked by bids which are based on performance. However, even with great performance you can be stuck with a bad shift. Not much of a work life balance depending on your schedule and time zone. Personal discount is also good.",,,Social Response Advisor,Former Employee,Remote,"November 1, 2022"
4.0,Good place,It was great until after COVID. There was no room growth anymore for remote workers. It you wanted to move up you were going to have to move to an in person location,,,AppleCare At-Home Advisor,Former Employee,Remote,"October 31, 2022"

2.0,"If like working with lots of people and working mall hour specially weekends, this is for you.","Zero work life balance. Mall hours means working on the weekends and evenings. Challenging to work

4.0,Its a great environment for those who love apple,On a typical day I work with customers solving problems with their phones.

3.0,Overrated,"I think that Apple actually does a good job making you think that you belong to this company but for the most part everything is an ends to the means for them. I would often while working at Apple be apart of coaching which was done not because their was anything wrong but more so just so someone could say that they were giving feedback to advance their career. I found at times there was no balance between what needs to be done and what should actually be done. For example, if there was no opportunities for feedback managers would often just find reasons just to give you feedback which often just came across as micromanaging. If you are ever on the wrong side of management best believe there are going to weaponize procedures to make your life unpleasant. There are good parts like the discounts and meeting amazing people but its not the dream they sold you. Have very clear intentions of where you want to go while being there.",,,Mac/Mobile Technical Support,Former Employee,"Mississauga, ON","October 25, 2022"

5.0,Unbeatable Benefits & Surprisingly Bad Management,"Let me start by saying I very much enjoyed working for Apple. I was on the Genius Bar Team pre-pandemic and then moved to phone support during the pandemic (which was debilitating and not at all the job I had the skills to do). The benefits are amazing, the work is fun, the people are great, the customers are eh, and the management is TERRIBLE. They are all just kind of like manager robots who are managing too many people to get to know anyone on an individual level and are encouraged to relate in the most creepy company way.

3.0,"Great products, not so much to work",The best products with (formerly) the best support. Apple now mostly hires vendors who are underpaid and undertrained. You never know whom you will speak to when you call. Customers can be abusive and downright mean. Apple takes away any segment that is not customer-facing. Requirements are getting stiffer as well. Management is outside hires who have never taken a call and lack understanding of the role. Schedules change routinely so it's hard to plan your life. The pay is good but leaves a lot of room for improvement. The only advancement is available on campus.,,,Senior Advisor,Current Employee,Remote,"October 14, 2022"

2.0,Company values changed disconnect from management.,"Company was great in early-mid 2010’s. Policy changed to discourage repairs and only new phone sales. Buying phones outright to avoid upgrade charges from the carrier also banished. Our older clientele were left high and dry when learning sessions were discontinued. At every role you’re responsible for providing feedback to coach other employees, even laterally, this creates a huge disconnect with management since a majority of the responsibility falls now on to yourself and your peers. Due to this, management is rarely around and mostly in the back watching videos. This also creates a problem for advancement. Your told to “journal” about your achievement and growth, you can make up stories and situations that can push your towards a promotion. This leads to employees being in roles they are not properly trained for. Pay is very low compared to the profit made for the company. Even an entry level sales person can sell hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of product but will receive no commission. Instead, you’re told that you’re “doing your life’s best work”. Great job if you’re younger looking for a fast paced environment. Be prepared to apologize for everything. Queues are very long and the store doesn’t have any signage so you’re “the sign” as well. Reporting inappropriate workplace behavior or harassment takes months for an response if any.",,,Creative Pro,Former Employee,"Glendale, AZ","October 10, 2022"

3.0,Technically talented colleagues. Lots of bureaucracy,"There is a lot of technical experience to learn from. Unfortunately, there is a lot of bureaucracy that can be felt even at the IC level, which makes it more challenging to focus on technical growth. Relatedly, there is a strong risk averse culture. You may spend as much time pitching to leaders the need to try new things as you spend actually innovating.",,,Data Scientist,Current Employee,"Sunnyvale, CA","October 6, 2022"
2.0,It’s not all its hyped up to be,"A lot of people put this company on a grand pedestal, as if it’s one of the best place to work and that’s not really the case, unless you working corporate. It’s starts off fine but after being there for a year or two you start to see the reality. The retail employees are basically the underdogs, and all of the glorified benefits that you get told about are mostly received by corporate individuals. The compensation and benefits are nice retail level too but the work life balance is absolutely horrible. The job itself is also very stressful, draining, and mentally demanding so I never have a social battery when I leave this place. You are bombarded by customers back to back and you really don’t get a break in between because they are concerned with their “numbers” so it’s very exhausting. The other side they don’t mention to you is the number of people who take their own lives or really struggle with mental health from being here so much. I have been here a while and seen people leave and go start new jobs and they seem much more happy. Don’t sacrifice your mental health for the extra dollar an hour.",,,Genius,Current Employee,Missouri,"October 5, 2022"

1.0,Apple hates helping their employees.,If you're someone who struggles with mental health do not work for Apple. They preach inclusivity and acceptance of others; but once you get in management will belittle you at the first sign of weakness and they'll do whatever they can to push you out rather than help you improve your standing in life,,,Product Specialist,Former Employee,"Oak Brook, IL","October 4, 2022"

3.0,Not what it used to be,"First, and most importantly, Apple does a great job of hiring non-management employees. Some of the best people I've ever worked with.

However...

Apple used to be a far better place to work than it is now. The pay, while admittedly better than most retail jobs, is not commensurate with how much money retail employees bring in for the company, nor for what you have to put up with from the post-pandemic retail customers.

Management is slow to act on issues the employees bring up, if at all. They will set up ""town hall"" meetings for people to raise issues, and then blatantly shoot down concerns that are raised. But there is also a culture of intimidation somewhat from the management, so no one really wants to raise issue in the first place.

For the past couple years raises have been less than inflation, so you're actually making less money now than in 2019, despite what your hourly rate shows.

The culture used to be to serve the customer's needs first, without much pressure to sell. Unfortunately, that is no longer the case as they have started putting much more emphasis on selling and that's really unfortunate.

Morale is quite low across the whole retail side of the business. There is a reason several stores in the US have unionized...",,,Specialist,Former Employee,"Toronto, ON","October 4, 2022"

2.0,Bunch of clowns,"Apple hired a bunch of clowns to manage the department. The managers are all underqualified and do not know how to do their job correctly. Most of the managers are hired from other departments (without going through interviewing process because they are friends with the senior manager). A very toxic and micromanaged work environment. The management team only cares about the numbers regardless of how heavy and more responsibility is on you. Career growth is not bright. The only growth is determined by how good your relationship is with your manager. No matter how hard you work for it, it all depends on the management team to decide if they want to promote you (whether you lick their shoes enough). The only good thing is the friendly and diverse colleagues that you will have.

5.0,Amazing company and great culture,"An amazing company to work for, with many top-notch benefits; diversity in backgrounds and ideologies; and usually excellent leadership (there are always bad apples out there), that care about you as a person, and help you develop in your career. Home-based remote options, varying shift options, and a dedication to work/life balance are excellent too. Personally have made many friends and enjoyed the camaraderie that develops. Great opportunity to learn about business and how companies run efficiently.

Negatives include: Promotional opportunities can feel limited, and competition is quite tough. Some roles can wear you down over time, or lose their luster / become boring. Metric goals can sometimes feel opposite to customer satisfaction.",,,Apple Pay Cash (APC) Fraud Prevention Specialist,Current Employee,"Austin, TX","September 23, 2022"

3.0,"Good pay, annoying job",Working at Apple was a dream at first but then it get very annoying with some of the micro aggressions that was faced at work. On top of that you get a phone call every seven seconds and there are only 15 minute breaks if you are part time. I had to use the bathroom really bad one time and I was expected from the company to finish using the bathroom within two minutes or I was going to get in trouble. That was the most annoying part of the job and other things. You need to have tough skin to work for this company because you’re going to be dealing with some rude customers. Also it is mandatory to work on Saturdays,,,College Advisor,Former Employee,Remote,"September 17, 2022"

3.0,Stable job with no advancement opportunity,"If your looking for a job that doesn't require much other than showing up to work, then this is the one. The benefits are great and beyond what most would need/use. However the ever increasing workload/expectations/metrics do not align with the pay or the end goal, which is helping the customer. You will be expected to work weekends/holidays without a say in your schedule. After 6 years of employment, all remote, the opportunities for advancement within the company were non-existent unless you wanted to work on campus and continue working in customer support. If you want to make a difference this is not the job for you. Your opinion is irrelevant and your just a warm body doing a mindless task.",,,AppleCare At-Home Advisor,Former Employee,Remote,"September 14, 2022"
1.0,Be prepared before you apply,"Apple has the worst internal culture of any company I've worked at. Routinely they promoted failing employees over those who carried entire departments with no resources, encouragement, or leadership. Leadership makes decisions based on friendship, and expects you to work 24/7 without being compensated for being on-call. They would even lie about company policies which were easy to find through the HR website.

5.0,"Fantastic company, tough to leave, but inconsistent scheduling makes me think about it.","I work in Apple Retail full time, so I work 40 hours a week, which is amazing. The only tough thing about it is the lack of consistency with the start/end hours each week, and trying to RTO for things outside of work, even with vacation time.

I have worked for multiple Apple stores and can confirm that each operates a little differently depending on who the senior managers are and depending on what market you are in.

All in all, I would recommend Apple to most people. It can be exhausting, but worth the effort put in. The opportunities with Apple are literally endless, assuming you can get out of the retail sector of the company.",,,Pro,Current Employee,"Nashville, TN","September 8, 2022"

3.0,Bittersweet and dehumanizing,"This company does not seem concerned with helping people get their feet in the door or advance their careers or skills.

I went thru VOLT on the recommendation of someone who was familiar with their process and knew someone for reference to help overall.

I worked one assignment at Apple and it was a bit dehumanizing and bittersweet considering I love the company and have many of their products and am very well acquainted. Helping customers is a joy for me and my knowledge was not encouraged.
This was a glorified customer service call center job and couldn't wait for the 1 year contract to end.",,,IOS Tech Support,Former Employee,"Elk Grove, CA","August 27, 2022"

1.0,"Fun workplace, sad management","Impossible to move around, managers clearly care about their own growth rather than yours, compensation is nice but only until you find someone there for 10 years is making the same amount as you.

5.0,"A wonderful Company full, powered by beautiful people.","I learned life long skills and made life long friends at Apple. If you get an opportunity there, take it.

5.0,Favorite Retail Job,"It was a good experience overall. I've worked retail ever since I turned 16, and Apple was by far my most favorite.

I met a lot of cool people through my location, and the management is always looking out for your best interest. They also almost always go out of their way to give honest positive feedback, and ensure you're always on a good path to promote within.

My favorite thing to take away from working at Apple is how I interact with people. I learned how to avoid and how to turn around a heated conversation.",,,Technical Specialist,Former Employee,"San Jose, CA","August 26, 2022"
5.0,Amazing,Apple is a life changer which people don't quite understand the value of those around you and the support the company gives to their employees. It is a special and unique experience which I have carried forward,,,Sales Manager,Former Employee,"Tysons Corner, VA","August 25, 2022"

4.0,Good teamwork and great company,"Dealing with the general public is hit and miss, sometimes customers can be too entitled.
Learnt a lot about Apple's values and what good customer service is.
Management are great and are there when needed.
Everyone has friendship groups but still come together and work well as a family and build great friendships outside of work.
Repetitive conversations with customers, full of constant interaction and fast paced, you rely on your team to get you through the day.",,,Specialist,Current Employee,London,"August 23, 2022"

4.0,Fun fast paced work environment with possibility for advancement,"It was fun working at apple; however, it is a stressful work setting as it can get very crowded very quickly. Managers are usually only hands on on their favorite people, and are focused on metrics more than anything.",,,Apple Specialist,Former Employee,Cincinnati,"August 23, 2022"
5.0,Great Place to Work,"I’m more amazed at the development culture at Apple. So many avenues you can take with your own development. Seems like the managers in place main purpose is to aid you you your development journey, from trainings to career experiences, to even resume help Apple has your development in their best interest.

Culture is amazing. VERY diverse group of individuals but still aligning with similar morals and company values. Apple just hires genuinely good people.

Always compensated fairly, always a sense of belonging. Benefits package is one of the best packages there is. If you get an job offer from Apple I encourage you to take it.

I will say it is a retail environment so weekend availability will be a MUST if you plan on getting a call back for an interview. Part time hours are flexible though.",,,Genius,Current Employee,"Durham, NC","August 22, 2022"
3.0,"Place to move up if you ""Drink the Koolaid""","Apple is a very large company that is very much driven by the bottom dollar.

4.0,Mostly Good,"Overall I have enjoyed my time at Apple. I have had a lot of opportunities to grow/progress my career, and have had a ton of support along the way. While most of my leadership has been great, there have been a few poor managers that have made the experience far different. Unfortunately many people have been promoted into management positions that have no business being there, and they don't get better with time.

Recently, there has been a fairly hard push to remain onsite even though most jobs can very easily work remotely. Leadership has determined they want to stand firm on this and it has negatively impacted morale across the board.",,,Project Manager,Current Employee,"Austin, TX","August 22, 2022"
3.0,Poor culture,"Poor work culture, people are cliqued up. There is a lack of diversity and old boys club on some teams. They constantly cut our commission in sales. There is no room for advancement.",,,Sales,Current Employee,"Austin, TX","August 22, 2022"

4.0,Fun workplace,"Pay could have been better, though one of the funniest environments I’ve ever worked in.

3.0,Energetic and great coworkers but poor scheduling,I was thrilled when I first got a job with Apple retail. I'm a full time student and their scheduling was unbearable to manage with my schooling.

4.0,Apple is a fun place to work,"When I first started working for Apple it was great but with all the changes with management and their focus was going forward, the culture died. you can grow within the company depending of if you have a manager who actually cares about your development.",,,Mentor,Former Employee,"New York, NY","August 11, 2022"
4.0,Clear team goals; high compensation,"Team had clear goals, objectives and deadlines.

Compensation was very good plus about half my salary in RSUs each year.

Job security good, but company seemed conservative with promotions/raises.

2.0,"Stressful, impossible, mediocre compensation","Working for Apple seems like it would be amazing. Sometimes it is, most of the time it's not. The people are awesome but the work volume is significantly higher than it is at other companies and the compensation is lower than other tech companies. Meta, Google, Dell, and others will pay higher for the same work. The culture is great and the perks are pretty cool. In the end, the work/life misbalance led me to depart.",,,Accounts Payable Specialist,Former Employee,"Austin, TX","August 11, 2022"
5.0,"Great Pay, respected by employer","Training was detailed, you where put on the phone with all you needed to succeed, my trainer was the best trainer I'd ever had, management for the most part was fair (there's always going to be a few bad apples) all in all it is a great place to work.",,,Transcom / IOS Support Advisor,Former Employee,"Fayetteville, NC","August 11, 2022"

3.0,Training was really good even after employment,"Apple does have some middle management problems. And management is unclear. I would advise those who apply to get ready to deal with alot of elderly people who do not understand tech, Young people without insurance on the phone is a big headache",,,Supervisor,Former Employee,"Houston, TX","August 10, 2022"
5.0,Excellent work/life balance just hate the constant management changes,"I’ve been working here for almost 10 years and they are hands down one of the best companies that have a great work/family/life balance. The only thing that’s not so great is if you are not technically inclined outside of what you are trained for, moving to different roles can be challenging (engineering positions, data analysis, security, and other positions that I can’t imagine people saying when they grow up they want to be what Apple offers.). So it’s basically first advisor, second advisor, then manager… everything else, you need that fancy degree",,,At Home iTunes Chat Advisor,Current Employee,Homebased,"August 10, 2022"

5.0,Leaders set you up for success and working there was super fun,"I loved working for Apple. The pay was great and so was the work culture and the benefits. Your supervisors really encouraged you to succeed and the team is so motivating. You get product discounts, you get free lunches occasionally, and it's joyful to promote a product that you're passionate about. The main con is that everything within Apple is interview based which isn't always great. If you want to get transferred to another store or progress from a seasonal position to a permanent position, it's going to be interview after interview. This is frustrating because I've known people who drove an hour everyday to work at my Apple Store because they couldn't get a position at their local one. I was sad about not getting a permanent position after doing multiple interviews. But if you do get the chance, then I encourage you to take up on that offer.",,,Specialist,Former Employee,"Costa Mesa, CA","August 8, 2022"

3.0,High wages for high demands,It’s all about Apple culture from the time you clock in to the time you clock out. There are perks that comes with the job but expectations are extremely high as they compensate well.,,,Operations Specialist,Former Employee,Canada,"August 4, 2022"

4.0,"Training is fun, calls are difficult","Apples got a great culture, pay, and benefits. Recruiting process kinda slow, not too bad but the training is exceptional. The call center part of the job is hard when you’re dealing with certain kinds of people but if you’ve gotta good attitude and a strong head on your shoulders you’re good just don’t let it affect you.
The scheduling kind of sucks bc it’s built around your school and nothing else but the growth opportunities there are endless so the pros and cons weigh each other out. I’ll never say to not work there just make sure you know you can give what’s expected of time, quality of work, and energy and you’ll be good.",,,AppleCare At-Home Advisor,Former Employee,Remote,"August 2, 2022"
5.0,Great company to work for!,"Great company to work for. I can’t say anything bad about the Company or it’s treatment towards employees. Decent pay, great benefits and time off is generous.

On the positive side, if you love helping people, this is the job for you. No call script (a big plus for me). At the end of the day, I felt like I made a big difference.",,,Tech Support Specialist,Former Employee,Home,"July 29, 2022"

4.0,Tons of opportunities to advance..very quickly.,"This job is great..for the right person. I HATED it. Starting out (in tech support) the hours are anytime between 1pm EST and 12 am.

3.0,lots of in depth hands on training,they give you a lot to work with in the form of resources however once on the job it is hard to continue to do the extra work such as journal entries. You are given a company email when hired so all requests go through there which can be hard to get used to from a retail background. in terms of conflict they will side with the company every time and not the employee.,,,Product Zone Specialist,Former Employee,"King of Prussia, PA","July 26, 2022"

2.0,A great stepping stone for your next carrier move,"If you're looking to get a start somewhere in the tech world its great, but if you're looking to grow with them then I would recommend looking else where.

You only really have about 3 or 4 moves you can make in retail because Apple hires externally for managers and they typically hold those spots for years. I have personally witness people with 10 years plus of experience get passed up for another applicant who worked as a manager in another retail company. Because of this you end up with alot of retail leaders who have no idea what front line employees do on the day to day. There's the expectation that you are supposed to trust them with leading the stores teams (which they often fail at due to lack of real world knowledge)

Just use the job as a stepping stone and try not to drink too much kool aid while you are there.

Pros: Decent pay and benefits

Cons: Poor leadership, toxic working environment, and minimal advancement.",,,Retail,Current Employee,"Saint Louis County, MO","July 25, 2022"

4.0,"Good job, if you can handle call center work","Overall the job is solid if you can stand call center work all day.

3.0,Sales specialist,The place was OK to work for however it did not live up to its stated goals. They always talk about supporting the employee and doing whatever it takes to help them fulfill their goals however in the two stores I worked at that was not the case. In fact in some cases the managers made it very difficult for me to move up within the organization. Probably has something to do with the fact that I am much older than most of the kids that were working in the store. The situation quite frankly was uncomfortable and I never felt accepted. In fact from two of the managers it was very difficult to have any meaningful interactions with them. If you’re in your 20s and younger it’s probably a cool place to work other than that I don’t recommend it. To me it seemed a bit cultish!,,,Sales Specialist,Former Employee,Freehold New Jersey,"July 23, 2022"

4.0,"Relaxed and fun, but outdated benefits","Apple has great a culture for employees in regards to trying to keep their employees engaged and feel apart of the company even when remote.
The biggest drawback is their compensation/ benefits. They appear to be outdated compared to other companies I’ve reviewed. You get the normal medical/ dental/ 401k benefits. There is a good discount on their products….every 2 years. Aside from that it’s a percentage off, but still expensive.
Their PTO policy needs to be revamped and the compensation is subpar to other relatable roles.
Leadership is pretty decent and all the ones I’ve interacted with definitely appear to have their employees best interest in mind.",,,Remote Team Manager/Senior Advisor/At-Home Advisor,Current Employee,"Atlanta, GA","July 22, 2022"
3.0,Fun with the right people,In my store in ft lauderdale there was no diversity in management not a good place to work .

Very not cool,,,Product Zone Specialist,Former Employee,"Fort Lauderdale, FL","July 22, 2022"
4.0,Great Company Culture. Sub-par Work/Life Balance,"The pay was good and full benefits plus discounts as a part-timer were great! I also enjoyed the culture of the store I worked in. Everyone really looks out for each other. However, as a part-timer you're basically working full time hours and I was denied Sundays off for religious reasons because ""the business needs"" of the store required having people work those shifts.

1.0,Nice offices. Bad culture.,It’s a good company to work for if you care about in-office perks. Beyond that I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone.

5.0,Fun workplace,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public. The store was always electric, although others may say crazy. I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.

The managers were all great and they were never above doing what they asked of their employees.

The benefits and pay were amazing for a part time job.

There is plenty of competition for the roles, so when you make it through, you get to work with some of the best people you could possibly meet. While there is plenty of corporate guidelines, there is still plenty of room for handling your role as you see fit. I may have been lucky, but my manager helped me find even better roles for me to work in and encouraged me when I wasn't feeling right at the company. The competition doesn't stop once you've been hired though if you're looking to advance in your career. I didn't mind though, as when there were times when I didn't get a position, I found the person who did always deserved it as much if not more than I did.

1.0,Not what it used to be,"Apple was once a great place to work, however lately the employee experience has deteriorated significantly.

I would like to start by highlighting that I found my immediate manager and senior level managers to be great people and very supportive during my time in Apple.
However, despite this Apple is no longer a good place to work due to recent policy shifts that have been coming from upper management:

It started with Apple mandating an imminent return of ALL workers who were working remotely since COVID to move back onsite to Cork city last year in the middle of the pandemic, at a time where COVID cases were spiralling out of control.

Apple also has permanent remote workers based all around Ireland and round the same time, we were informed these workers would be excluded from any future progression opportunities unless they move to Cork city or commute to the Cork office on a daily basis.

For context: Cork is Ireland's 2nd worst hit city in terms of the housing crisis.
It got to a stage where rent costs ate up nearly ALL of my salary here.
I know several people who have had to back out of job offers and move back home because they were simply unable to find any property to rent in Cork!!

Apple are not helping Cork's housing crisis by mandating the return around 6000 employees back onsite to the Cork offices when it's clear most of their jobs could be done perfectly well at home... (a point proven by the standard of work done by myself and others remotely over 12 months during the pandemic)

I pleaded with Apple to continue to work remotely due to the housing costs in Cork",,,Technical Support,Former Employee,"Cork, County Cork","July 6, 2022"

2.0,Favoritism is the key to promotion,"Very little advancement opportunities. I wanted to work my way from the ground up so that when I got promoted, I could be a better leader.

4.0,Apple is a good company but race is still an issue,"I can honestly say this is a great company. I left because after four years I was sitting beneath a whole new set of managers that were white and beside the same brown faces. We had all tried to move around or up however we continued to stay put when others would promote quickly.

Call centers have this issue everywhere and I can say apples ears where empathetic but change was too slow.

Mental wellness is a high priority and apple has amazing benefits. I took several months off after my mom and sister passed in rapid succession and apple was ✨ chefs kiss✨ During that time. Full pay more than five months out of work.

4.0,WFH Apple is a pretty good place to work,"However, don’t expect raises, we were given stock that we had to wait for instead. Apple was part of the great stock by back when the government gave them money- we didn’t see any of it in bonuses. Actually we never saw bonuses.
Even if you were the top of the review, which was difficult to get- raises were meager, but stock was given. Again, you had to wait for it.
My manager was great.
If you don’t accept a position, don’t expect another one.
The hours are the hours in different departments, so not a lot of flexibility.

5.0,Communication and inclusivity is top notch!,"I just went through the hiring process with Apple for the Specialist position and I'm so excited to start soon.

I am currently on my OPT (work authorization granted to international students) and had restrictions regarding my start date. Management has been so understanding, accommodating and inclusive throughout this process. They never made me feel less-than and quickly rescheduled my training to accommodate my situation.

I have been in the job search for almost 2 months, submitted over 100 applications and went through multiple interviews. You'd be surprised at how many companies praise diversity and inclusivity in workforce, but fail to practice it during the hiring process. Unlike others, I can confidently say that Apple's culture shines through in every aspect of their business operations.

4.0,Communicate with HR & Management (BOTH),"Store position. Wonderful product and culture. Good benefits. Most colleagues were smart, friendly, and helpful. You are assigned a mentor/manager and your success depends on that person’s ability to communicate, but you might not realize that until it’s too late. Went with the flow, moved around as asked and covered stations as needed. Got some kudos and shout outs during morning meetings several times, so presumed I was doing well. A few weeks in, happened to discover that other mentor/mgrs had established weekly check in meetings, assigned tasks to learn and perform to gain specific experiences, provided information and career guidance to their agents, set goals and recommendations based on sales targets etc. Manager that was my “mentor” had barely said hello to me twice, and had never had a full conversation. Mind blown, but with a less reputable company, I probably would have been more proactive. They had things so well organized and structured that I simply expected that to continue. Very disappointing. Also, while majority of store team was amazing, there was definitely a small clique that had developed and management did not seem to have any awareness of it. Hopefully, they realized and have corrected course. Overall, I have no complaints. It was still a good experience. I left with some new knowledge and met some great people.",,,Specialist,Former Employee,"North Park, TX","June 23, 2022"
5.0,Apple has the best culture in which I've ever worked!,"After working for several other Fortune 500 companies, I found Apple to actually ""walk the talk"" or in other words truly care about their team members. It was refreshing to be empowered to support the team and utilize situational adaptability. Product knowledge and ability to keep up with the pace is likely the most challenging for sales and support teams. Leading the team was fun and we were fortunate to hire the best of the best.

It can be done with a company this large. I may have to leave the company because I don't make enough to support myself here in california.

4.0,"Great Career, just not flexible.","I was excited to start my career at Apple. It took me years just to get hired. Everything in my life was lined up perfectly, so my first few months went flawlessly. I was in line for a promotion, but I never got to accept it. The problem was simple, my life had changed, I could no longer work Saturdays. There was no option for me NOT to work Saturdays. My direct manager claimed that Saturday was a REQUIRED day, and if I couldn't work Saturdays, then I would probably just lose my job. Other than that, it was a PERFECT place to work. I ended up leaving after missing 3 consecutive scheduled Saturdays. But if I get another interview, I'm RUNNING back.

1.0,A shop job sold as far more than it really is,"Worked here as a technical specialist for a couple years. The worst work culture I’ve ever been in. It’s like being in school all over again. People are cliquey, management are atrocious and actively encourage and engage in damaging gossip about their own staff. If you’re seen as an outlier you will be made to feel ostracised as a way of trying to force you out of the job if they don’t have good reason to dismiss you. Felt a huge amount of relief upon leaving and only wish I had done so sooner.",,,Technical Specialist,Former Employee,Cardiff,"June 22, 2022"
5.0,Great place to work,"A beautiful combination of interesting, curious, and adventurous people taking the company to new heights.

5.0,Great experience,"My time at Apple was an informative experience. Both the management team and my co-workers were helpful and genuinely wanted seasonal hires to exceed in their role, no matter how brief of time with the company.",,,Specialist,Former Employee,"Little Rock, AR","June 20, 2022"
4.0,A Good but Mixed Job,"Overall was a good place to work. Had its highs and lows.

The interview process was very long and it took a total of three interviews & 3 months until I actually started working there. The training was very in-depth and I learnt a lot about how the company operates, products, their approach to serving customers etc. My contact was 20hrs but I worked more than 30hrs some weeks, but would mainly hover around the 25 - 30 mark.

The store I worked in was a very small Apple Store, nothing like the massive London or Birmingham stores and as a result it wasn't as ""cool"" as working in a larger flagship store there. The majority of the staff were nice, friendly and there was never any issues between anyone as far as I was aware. The majority of staff lie in the 20 to 30 age range. The management was ok, some ""Leads"" were really lovely and honestly cared about me despite me only working there for a few months. Some Leads were a bit more intimidating but still ok. The Store Manager was absolutely lovely and he would speak to all the employees like he was just on the same level as you, even visiting the shop floor and being with customers from time to time.

The job itself was fine, days could be action packed or really slow. When working a shift like 4pm to 8pm, it would be dead by 7pm. Most of the time I was dealing with customers and the store was small enough to have a mix of iPhone, iPad, Mac and Accessories customers. By far the best part was being ""On Point"" with an iPad and a radio and directing customers around with other staff members. The customers themselves were tolerable,",,,Specialist,Former Employee,United Kingdom,"June 20, 2022"

4.0,Fun place to work,"Advancement is possible but a prolonged process with various tedious interviews. To be, or not to be"" is the opening phrase of a soliloquy given by Prince Hamlet in the so-called ""nunnery scene"" of William Shakespeare's play Hamlet, Act 3, Scene 1. In the speech, Hamlet contemplates death and suicide, bemoaning the pain and unfairness of life but acknowledging that the alternative might be worse.",,,Product Zone Specialist,Current Employee,"Virginia Beach, VA","June 19, 2022"
4.0,They treat you well.,"Let me just flat out say, Apple isn’t my favorite job I’ve ever had. However, it’s certainly a great job to have. The culture they have created and your work knowledge is ingrained in the employee for how intense the training is (you gotta earn the blue shirt they say!!). They are open to feedback, improvement, criticism. I have seen the company change from recriving complaints from employee. It’s nice to know they listen.
Besides, the pay is definitely higher than a lot of jobs out there, and the benefits are endless.",,,Sale Specialist,Current Employee,"Irvine, CA","June 19, 2022"

1.0,Narrow minded company with nose in the air attitude,"Purely my experience, but the retail side of Apple is an afterthought at best.

Very tough to get any time for development with him.",,,Sr. Manager,Former Employee,Retail,"June 17, 2022"
5.0,Nice entry level job,"Good place to work as a college job. The hours are a bit inflexible but the benefits and PTO sort of make up for it. A lot of repetitiveness, but they try to liven things up with games or even time away from the phones to chat (depending on your manager). I met some of the most memorable people in my life here.",,,AppleCare Technical Support Advisor,Former Employee,Remote,"June 17, 2022"
4.0,Great benefits,This job is great for young folks or looking for a part time gig. That way you are not burnt out because if you make yourself 100% available they will use it. Overall I did like working for the company I even interviewed to return after I left for 2 years to work oversee’s but turned the offer down as I took a risk working somewhere else in order to challenge myself which i am happy I did as I am not one of the highest ranked managers in my current employment in less than 6 months with 3 raises under my belt. It’s been a fantastic journey in Apple and happy with closing the chapter also.

3.0,Golden handcuffs might be worth it for you...,"Were it not for the rampant cronyism and past enabling of verbal and physical abuser by upper management, the company have actually had a 5 star rating. Unfortunately, the company favors and defends their bad actors in management over their hourly workers, and has shown a track record of HR deferring to upper management regarding disputes w/o any consideration for their hourly workers.

You'll never work in a more modern kitchen with more qualified and wonderful cooks and middle management, but know that, while those running the show at the top still run it, you do so at the very real risk of being put into situations of abuse and harm.",,,"Lead Cook, Caffe Macs",Former Employee,"Austin, TX","June 14, 2022"
3.0,Not what it used to be,"There is no career progression anymore, everything is lateral movement so they avoid giving you a raise but they have no problem adding a ton of more responsibility. Trying to get into a non customer facing role is nearly impossible, regardless of how qualified you are and how well the interviews go. The constant feedback is “keep doing what you’re doing” because there is nothing actually helpful as to why you didn’t get the role. They always push to network and that it’s really dependent on who you know. You can complete the management training, do the mgmt role for years, and still be denied TM positions because a prerequisite of applying is “must already be a TM in a different org”. You chat 3 customers at a time, you are timed, you are abused by customers, you go to breaks late, you stay past your shift end time, and it creates a stressful toxic environment. Apple didn’t used to be like this.",,,Chat Advisor,Current Employee,Remote,"June 14, 2022"
4.0,Overall good,I lied working at Apple. No job is perfect but you can leave there with a lot more knowledge to help you succeed somewhere else the perks are nice. Benefits are great!,,,Specialist,Former Employee,World trade,"June 14, 2022"
3.0,Nice job but toxic work environment,"I was a temporary worker, so I only worked in the store for a couple of months, but I noticed a lot of things that came off as red flags. The management is very partial to permanent employees, and temporary workers tend to be let aside. Coworkers are just looking out for themselves and won't hesitate to stab people on the back or tell your wrongdoings to management. A lot of them also have this condescending attitude that because they work at Apple, they're above everyone else. But I really loved the job that I did there and the customer service training they give is great. The customers are tough but it's manageable and even fun once you get the hand of it. I did make some friends and have some good time so all in all, I liked the job, just not so much the environment.",,,Specialist,Former Employee,Quebec Province,"June 13, 2022"
2.0,Fast Paced Learning,You have to learn fast paced. The user interface for he job can be daunting but after a while you'll get it. It is interesting. You learn a lot of about Apple products and the company.,,,AppleCare Advisor,Current Employee,Remote,"June 13, 2022"

5.0,amazing,"Pros

Working at Apple has been one of the greatest highlights in my career. I’m happy to work in such a safe and stable environment. The benefits are amazing, especially the 4 month maternity leave and annual spending account for maternity. We have in house services such as dental and chiropractor that is really really affordable. The senior management is really supportive.

Cons

There’s little room to grow. People who speak well or only knows how to talk (and do nothing) get promoted faster than people who actually do their job right.

3.0,"Freedom to be yourself, Little opportunity to evolve, Fun has turned into figure pleasing with little recognition.","When I first started my career at Apple years ago I loved the energy, drive, fun and opportunities Apple offered, although sadly I cannot say the same today. As business started to change over the years the main focus of Apple has become quite dry with many employees losing motivation. Instead of a fun and super encouraging environment Apple has switched its passion into figures and percentages with little recognition to those who meet targets and little focus anymore with creating a happy motivated team that feels appreciated for the work they do.

When I wanted to develop myself and evolve further within the company I was continuously rejected and was never even given the opportunity to finish an entire internal interview process. As I understand rejection is a part of growth its sad that Apple are not able to give opportunities to those who work for them over the years. Many employees are witnessing new comers enter into roles so easily with little expertise and experience as the internal interview process has become strictly formal, so when you answer a question exactly how management want to hear it you suddenly become more evolved then anyone else that’s been in the company for years. Apple were once accomodating to everyone learning styles and focusing on strengths but it appears now to grow we are all judged through a linear interview process that doesn’t build on strengths but more so makes us leave the interview process feeling devalued.

At the start of my career at Apple I felt supported and felt my evolution at Apple meant a lot to management. I now feel that -

3.0,"Consistent and Benefit-Rich, but Little Opportunity to advance.","Apple has been overall a great place to work at. I've been working with them for nearly four years now, and they've taken great care of me during the pandemic. Their benefits are extensive and are almost impossible to match by other employers that aren't another Silicon Valley corporation.

However, if you are looking to move up within the company simply through hard work, temper your expectations. Once you're in a position with Apple, you're most likely stuck there unless you're an absolute All-Star AND you pursue a promotion.

4.0,Great company to work for HORRIBLE CUSTOMERS,"The staff and mgmt are amazing, and the customers made me and hundreds of others quit. They made me hate my job I moved up very quick to the highest position which is a senior advisor for MAC+ that means you handle it all and have no one to transfer to and I quit even quicker because the higher you get the worse the customers are! Especially the MAC DEPT STAYYYY AWAY FROM MAC YOU WILL REGRET IT AND QUIT ASAP!!",,,Senior Advisor for MAC+,Former Employee,Remote,"May 23, 2022"
4.0,Great for college students or an in between job,"Overall the benefits and perks are pretty solid. The compensations is decently fair depending on the market your in.

3.0,Good benefits. Ok management.,"Culture is cool at Apple. Haven’t had supportive managers at the retail store though, as they worry about the numbers more.

4.0,Good place to work at,"I think as a corporation it offers great benefits and have a great culture from the macro perspective, but at the store level you can experience some favouritism from leadership toward certain employees.

4.0,"Great place to work, customers ruin it sometimes","Apple is a great place to work with many opportunities for growth, great emphasis on worker well-being, and a feeling of support among colleagues.

Taking calls all day isn't hard work, but dealing with disgruntled customers and combating their various levels of technical understanding becomes tiresome and frustrating. Call duration goals are drilled into you at Apple, but there is a general understanding for the many circumstances they can't be met.

This role will require absolute understanding and a firm grasp of good customer service.","Fair pay, great benefits, healthy workplace environment, flexible","Customer interaction experience can fluctuate, metric targets can cause some stress",Technical Advisor,Former Employee,Work from Home,"May 18, 2022"
4.0,Great place if you like talking with people!,I worked for Apple retail for about 3 months and it was a great opportunity to meet some fun and creative customers and team members. It really feels like a team and it is definitely a place I could see myself at for a long while. I ended up moving across the country for another opportunity but Apple will forever be something that I cherished.,,,Specialist,Former Employee,Partridge Creek,"May 18, 2022"
2.0,"SELL SELL SELL SELL is the message you will hear from mgmt, even when doing repairs","In my many years at the Apple store, management's focus devolved from making sure every customer is properly cared for to making sure we cycle through absolutely as many customers as possible so that we can push Applecare Plus, Apple One, Business at Apple, and whatever other money-making ideas Apple may have had this month.

It is very busy at the Apple Store, and after interactions with your customer, management will often approach you, but they don't ask about how the customer was feeling when they left...instead they ask about how you presented the various services available to buy, and how many times you tried to convince your customer to pay for a service they simply don't want. You'll be encouraged to end your sessions with customers ASAP so that you can move on to the next person that may want to pay for Apple Music.

Just know that if you apply at an Apple Store, no matter how much your customers like you and how many issues you may help them resolve, you'll only be as good as your last quarter's sales numbers.",,,Technical Expert,Former Employee,"Leawood, KS","May 18, 2022"
5.0,Productive and prestistage,"The position is at home. The company is AMAZING. There are limitless advancement opportunities. You work with some very cool people and the leadership cares about your development. You may get coaching but you never get battered or belittled. The pay is decent and the benefits include, 401(k) match, stock purchase options, product discounts and discounts on services across many different areas, education assistance, child care assistance, paid vacation, sick time and other time off options, health club Reimbursment or bike cost set off.

4.0,Good for people who like to network,"Apple was a great place to work! My co-workers were friendly and my managers were understanding. The pay is great and they definitely take care of you if you get sick or any other type of leave. I met a lot of unique customers and have plenty of stories to tell. It is a sales job though so while overall sales really don’t seem to matter, they will push selling AppleCare+ pretty hard or other “bundled” sales.

I personally don’t have the personality for the culture they’re trying to cultivate. That seems to be a culture of being very chummy with overhead. It reminded me of high school with how students would try to one up each other by being the most interesting or gossipy. In that regard, that makes the biggest impact on if you’ll be retained or not. If any managers or experts(floor supervisors) invite you to things(lunches or after work outings), know that more than likely you’ll be on the road towards advancement. However, all things being equal, there is a slight appearance preference, at least in my experience.",,,Specialist,Former Employee,"Brandon, FL","May 17, 2022"
3.0,Alright,"Place was alright, its retail, but its the best retail place you can work at in my opinion. But again, its still retail so dont expect it to be different than any other place. The managers were awesome, they all stressed the importance of mental health and where to look for helpful resources when in need. Hardest part was dealing with clients who are already frustrated at a problem.",,,Product Specialist,Former Employee,"Orland Park, IL","May 17, 2022"

5.0,"Dynamic, busy, exciting work environment, excellent products, amazing people!","Apple Retail is many things! It’s nearly impossible to think of a more interesting or busy retail work environment! You’ll help customers that are raving fans all the way down to people that are angry they are there to buy a cable to replace one they broke. You can make or break someone’s day/week/month when you sell them an iPhone depending on the questions you ask and how much understanding you have of many moving pieces (most importantly their current syncing & backup strategy). Often times you’ll need to send a customer home so they can complete a backup before they buy so they will be ready to restore from their backup and/or to erase and trade in their current device. If you work at Apple for long enough you’ll likely have some high highs and some low lows. If you are Full Time and or work there long enough you could have other opportunities to do things like lead training, help with New Store Openings, Visual Refreshes or Resets (typically happens when the store is closed for business). If you’re looking to get promoted you’re going to have to really excel as excellence is the baseline! You’ll need to learn to be open to as well as ask for and give constant feedback (positive and constructive). You’ll also need to own your own development and ask for time off the sales floor or away from your role in order to document your successes and failures. If you’re the type that knows what you want to do you’ll definitely have support in getting there as long as you are willing to own most of that process and constantly check-in along the way!",,,Back of House Specialist,Former Employee,"Cool Springs, TN","May 16, 2022"
3.0,They don't pay tech support very well at all,Don't work for AppleCare. You'll get screwed. You're a number. They don't care about you. They don't pay you even remotely what you're worth.

4.0,Stressful & no career development,"Depends of the department it could be a stress and messy. No career development from home. Salary isn’t good enough.

It’s good for an entry level but I don’t recommend to stay here, especially if you work from home.",,,Agreement Advisor - work from home,Current Employee,"Cork, County Cork","May 15, 2022"
3.0,"Great company to work for, but not for career progression","Loved working at apple. Culture & benefits is the best part. However, Apple tends to hire below what a candidate is qualified to do, and not much room for advancement. Annual performance reviews rarely give credit where credit is due. Don’t expect much career growth or pay increases. Competition all seems to pay better. If you’re going to work here make sure your pay & job title is more than fair for your experience from the start.",,,Recruiting Coordinator,Former Employee,"Austin, TX","May 15, 2022"
5.0,Contagiously positive environment,"Apple is such a great company to work for. The people are so positive and willing to help. Everyone always makes you feel welcome, and the management really cares about your development. Benefits are great, and the pay is awesome for a retail location.

2.0,amazing benefits but management/culture is very poor,"When I started working at Apple Igot the impression that it was going to be just about the customer experience. I understood that there wouldn’t be a lot of upselling or anything but that seems to just be the case after the holiday season. I started working there November 2021 and things seemed to just switch once it hit January. we’ve mostly just been talking about how to sell more applecare+ and figure out how to overcome objections rather than really connecting with a customer. its all just become a means to an end thing which is like yeah a customer is going in there to most likely buy something but its just very transactional no matter how hard they try to seem like its not. also at my store its just a terrible leadership team who have no interest in getting to know the newer members and expect you to just get to know them when that shouldn’t be put onto us it should be the leadership that makes the effort to connect with their team members and to make them comfortable but they really dont. the only good thing i can say about this job is the benefits are really good, the discounts are great and the pay is great at my store. i’ve also met a ton of cool people so i’m not complaining about that but the general culture is not good it seems like you really have to drink the koolaid in order to get anywhere else besides being in the product zone.",,,Product Zone Specialist,Current Employee,"San Francisco, CA","May 14, 2022"
2.0,Used to be great,Not the same company anymore. Cares more about numbers and selling than anything. Leadership is a joke and hardly knows what they are doing at any given time.

2.0,Bad place to work in reality. Big Company Name but will eventually drag you down.,Apple is a cult and is suffocating. I have been here for 3 years and have had no room to grow and I am actually going backwards. You have constant meetings about progression but I feel they have already given up on me. It's all about stats and numbers are the only thing that counts. I have looked for a rotation job in another department but have heard nothing back yet. Perhaps its just my department but I cannot free my mind and i am stick in this loop of doing the same task over and over again trying to be nice.,,,CSS advisor,Current Employee,Cork,"May 12, 2022"

Apple values staff: food in the kitchen with more student type food at the end near payday. Special fun themed days. Caring but strict management - they DO expect professionalism, timeliness and courtesy at all times. Customers are actively encouraged to review YOU and their experience. It IS sales based even though it isn’t put across that way.

2.0,"Well paying job, long working hours and unfair management",Working at apple paid very well. It was nice working with customer and colleagues but the management at the store was terrible.

4.0,"Great place to work, but culture felt a little forced","Amazing pay/benefits/opportunities. Apple seems to care for its employees (not really, but more so than any other company I've worked for). They have so many benefits, ranging from health insurance to discounts on plane tickets or adidas. Just the most random perks you can think of, all because you work for Apple.

But that comes at a cost. Be ready to endure some strict management. Schedules are always planned in advance, down to your break times. You are expected to clock in/out on the minute or you are late. No grace periods (at least not at my store). Most of you know where Apple stores are placed, and most of the time parking is not right in front of the store. That means if I started at 9:30, I had to be parking at 9:20 so I could run around the closed mall, run through the mall, run all the way to the back of my store, log in to my profile on one of the devices, and clock in. That doesn't seem so bad, but that's just coming in. It's 3:10pm and you're on the floor helping a new customer, but you have a break at 3:15. There's no way you can break away. You are late to your break by 5 minutes, so you need to let a lead know. 70% of the time you are made to feel rushed because now that your break is late, the next people can't go on break or lunch because they didn't plan for the unexpected leave.

3.0,Low compensation for the amount of technical skill you are expected to exhibit.,"I have met wonderful people at this company. The main issue with the company is that they ask you to take on a lot more technical responsibility but provide little or no training. I thought a Trillion dollar company could afford to train their employees to support customers but now I see I was wrong. If you are hired to provide support for iOS customers you will soon be doing Mac Support with little training. The company has a lot of products and services and you are expected to be aware of and provide support for most items. in addition to providing software support for Mac and iOS devices, you will assist with AirPods, Home Pods, Apple TV, Apple Watch, Apple TV, and countless accessories. You will also provide support for their countless apps like the home app, fitness app, photo app, etc. I thought a company so profitable would be more specialized but you will find one person is expected to do an awful lot.",,,Senior Technical Support Advisor,Current Employee,Remote,"April 13, 2022"

3.0,At-home iOS advisor with apple support,"Paid very well at €16 an hour, in the role of at-home iOS advisor. Fast-paced high pressure call centre job, often only 7 seconds between calls. Management expect great performance with the ability to efficiently handle a vast array of problems on the spot while keeping customers happy and simultaneously logging the interaction in software. I didn't mind the fast-paced multitasking required but had to quit as I found it a very emotionally labourous and draining job. I would only recommend these phone advisor positions to those able to keep distanced from the customers' emotions, as they will often unload baggage and direct dissatisfaction with the company toward you.","Work from home, Good pay €16 per hour, Health and dental insurance, Broadband reimbursement and funding for gym membership.","No in-person interaction with colleagues, Customers have high (often unrealistic) expectations of service and are easily disappointed, Very high emotional labour required, like most call centre jobs.",Customer Service Advisor,Former Employee,Home based,"April 10, 2022"

2.0,Zero Progression - Saving money with internal 6 month contracts,"Absolutely zero progression.
All internal roles are 6month contracts then you rotate back to old role and they fill it with a new person so they don’t have to pay any employee an increase for a permanent role. It’s a way of keeping all support staff stuff in a rut.

I personally think they are trying to push a mass exodus of internal Apple customer support staff so they can farm out the work to 3rd party vendors in other countries. This would mean less salaries and benefits paid out.

A huge population of Apple employees have been WFH for over 10 years now but they have recently brought in new rules that any upward progression would require hybrid working in Cork. They have loyal hardworking staff who live in Donegal, Cavan, Mayo etc that can in no way do a daily commute to Cork even for one day a week. It’s shocking and shows how out of touch the leadership in Ireland is.
Seems to just be a way for them to justify the money spent on the campus now.

Only positives from the role are the health benefits.",,,Technical Support,Current Employee,Work from home,"April 8, 2022"

2.0,NO advancement - forcing staff out for vendors,"Company has been forcing staff out for vendors and currently is for every 1 internal employee in AppleCare there are 10 external vendor employees. We spend most of our day fixing their mess only to be told by senior leadership they are not allowing promotions and advancement and job changes.

They are lying to employees about work they will be doing and flat out changing job requirements and duties on the fly and without telling people and being told to either accept it or be fired.

There used to be many departments but there are few now, one person now does the job of what 8-9 different departments used to do. They also expect you to do the overall job faster.

No one wants to take any responsibility, but everyone wants a piece of your cake if you do. There is a strong bias constantly smothered by the talk about inclusion on diversity when in reality, all senior leadership is white. There is no sense of drive for a common goal. It's really about the flavor of the week or even day. Salespeople are pushed to the brim to sell products that this same company uses to emphasize experience. Service folks are drained of energy and asked to help customers with ridiculous issues. Operations and business teams aren't that much better either. They are overworked and underpaid.

3.0,Not bad but still retail,"-Great company for benefits and some of the people but as usual, corporate has no idea what it's like in their stores and gives the bare minimum.

4.0,Great Salary and Benefits,"It is true that the company really does look after their own staff. Very good pay and benefits come with whatever role you are in at Apple.

3.0,Decent Gig,Apple has decent pay and great benefits as an Applecare advisor. You can get stuck in this department for a while. Hard to advance or get ooprtunity elsewhere.

4.0,"Great company to work for, can be disorganized and chaotic","Apple stores are always busy, so you can imagine how you're always working. That being said the compensation felt worth it.

Upper management is solid but there can be a disconnect at times with leads, lack of training, and support despite it being promoted in orientation. Coworkers are mostly great.

Would work at Apple again, depending on which location.",,,Operations Specialist,Former Employee,"Toronto, ON","March 21, 2022"

5.0,A place you can call a family,"I worked at apple as a seasonal employee. Since day one I felt as if I was going to do great things. You’d make friends easily (well depending on how many days you work per week, I’m kinda awkward) and they’d be your family. The work-life (school) balance was a bit iffy since I was a full-time college student but I was still successful in both ways. They couldn’t keep me because of my schedule and plus there weren’t a lot of spots left for a permanent position.

If you’re deciding wether you want to work here or not, : - Are you a fulltime student? If yes, it won’t be the best place for you since it’ll take a lot of your time and you won’t be able to study and work at the same time. Same goes for a fulltime employee somewhere else.
If this doesn’t apply to you and you want to work full time here, go for it. It’s pretty competitive but give it your all. It’s worth it",,,Specialist,Former Employee,"Bethesda, MD","March 18, 2022"
1.0,Lowball salaries in retail stores,Not a great place to work retail. You get no option to work the same days every week; every week is different. It’s hard to run your life like that!,,,Product Specialist/Sales,Former Employee,"Greenwich, CT","March 17, 2022"
4.0,"Apple Retail, incredibly exciting place to work. Retail managers need more experience.",I enjoyed my tour of duty at Apple as a seasonal employee. I found that I had qualifications that far exceeded most of the employees at this establishment. I believe I was passed up for full employment due to age ism.,,,Technology Specialist (Seasonal Employee),Current Employee,"Cerritos, CA","March 17, 2022"
4.0,"Productive, very busy, but good compensation","I worked for apple for nearly two years. My specific experience was okay. I had some amazing coworkers, some not so great (they would take advantage of new hires and steal customers that would be getting extended service like apple care or business intros). Speaking of which, if you want to succeed, high Applecare and business intro numbers will get you almost anywhere at the retail level. You are paid very well for the scope of work you do, along with receiving benefits even as a part timer. They kept us working during the pandemic which was nice. However at my location, there were definitely favourites who got special treatments. preferred shifts, opportunities, and ""slightly longer breaks"" than others. In short, this is the peak of retail and a great experience. It shares the same ""toxic"" qualities as most retail places.",,,Product Zone Specialist,Former Employee,"Toronto, ON","March 17, 2022"
1.0,No work life balance,"The Good. Cool products, great office complex(Apple Park). Good pay and benefits.

3.0,Good for retail,"Demanding environment that underwent negative changes in strategy and leadership over time. Paid better than other retailers, but failed to live its stated values in pursuit of the almighty dollar.

Must have nearly open availability at this point. Led to many clopens.",,,Apple Specialist,Former Employee,"Edmonton, AB","March 14, 2022"
4.0,Great place to work if you want to move up,"If you love tech and have aspirations to move up at Apple, it's definitely the right place.

5.0,productive and fun workplace,Good experience of working at apple. the working environment is good and people are productive.,,,Employee,Current Employee,"London, KY","March 12, 2022"
2.0,"Great Pay, But Limited Progression","Honestly, I do like working for Apple. Great pay and benefits. The problem is that there almost no room for progression. They host a handful of progression events but in 3 years I haven’t even been interviewed. I ask to learn, but I get ignored. My manager went on a 3 month hiatus and cancels every meeting I schedule. The only thing they care about is “the business” and they are clear in that. You, the employee, matter very little to Apple. My cumulative raise since starting is a total of $5 an hour over 3 years, with the bulk of that coming from a regional adjustment that bumped me $3 to match average pay in my area. Without that, I only really got about 4% based on performance. Bonuses that aren’t announced in newspapers are stock based with a 4 year seeding period, so those amount to nothing really.

If you are comfortable cleaning up mistakes made by others and receiving subpar wage increases, then absolutely sign up. If you want a career, build skills somewhere else because Apple won’t help.",,,At Home Advisor,Current Employee,"Cupertino, CA","March 11, 2022"
5.0,Diversity,"A lot of racaes and people, which go them are core value of my companies.

Especially those in the Bay Area, the stipends they are paid mostly goes towards rent.",,,Expert,Former Employee,"San Francisco, CA","March 9, 2022"
5.0,Love it,"Working at Apple was a great experience. Work never felt like work because I loved what I did and I loved interacting with the public. The store was always electric, although others may say crazy. I'd say electric because the experience was exhilarating.",,,Customer Service Specialist,Former Employee,"Austin, TX","March 8, 2022"
3.0,Stressful and competitive but perfect for the right person,"Liked working at Apple but no work life balance as you had to work most weekends, and didn’t have a set 5 day roster for full time.

At times it was really busy and felt understaffed, and most people felt overworked and burned out.

I recommend Apple to work, you will learn a lot, make amazing friends and if you don’t stY there it will look incredible on your resume for future opportunities, just also look after your mental and physical health at the same time.",,,Specialist,Former Employee,New South Wales,"March 7, 2022"

4.0,Lots of good but stressful,Overall the job was generally pleasing. I learned a lot and had a great time helping customers with their apple products. The general downfall is the lack of outside time I had. Minimal opportunity to attend clubs or meetings outside of work for school was the ultimate reason why I left.,,,Apple At Home Advisor,Former Employee,Work at home,"March 5, 2022"
5.0,Positives outweigh the minor negatives,Fun company to work for and managers love to help you succeed. It can be stressful at times due to large call volume and angry customers but you also talk to a lot of people from all over NA and can have some great conversations. There are many more positives that outweigh the negatives.,,,AppleCare At-Home Advisor-College Program,Former Employee,"Remote-Tempe, AZ","March 3, 2022"
3.0,Remote chat representative. Great benefits. Management only cared about the numbers in customer surveys. Paid training and equipment is provided.,"Mandatory OT during new software rollouts. Up to 3 chats at a time, unable to prioritize a customer when answering ASAP for time limit metrics. Management cared more about customer service than fixing the problem. If you can nicely tell someone that their expensive device is messed up you're golden. Very stressful to be assisting 3 customers with Mac issues, testing can be very in-depth.",,,Tier 1 Technical Support,Former Employee,Remote,"March 3, 2022"
3.0,dont bother applying,"Managers talk a lot about progression, but the progression is only for people they like regardless of how good you are at your job.",,,Specialist,Former Employee,birmingham,"March 2, 2022"
5.0,Literally the best job experience I've ever had...,"Worked at Apple retail as a Product Specialist for approximately 5 months, on a seasonal contract.

I am in my mid thirties and have held dozens of jobs in my lifetime, as such, I tend to approach most new jobs with a very low tolerance for BS. I'll walk.

I did have a couple of those moments there but after a couple of weeks, it quickly became clear that this company actually ""buys what it sells""; they believe in their culture.

The compensation is great and benefits are awesome.

Advancing does seem to be difficult though, as you will be competing with internal applicants with literal years of experience with Apple on most open positions.

I absolutely recommend this company. If you are invited for a role or position, I encourage you to take it. You won't get a much better offer, IMO.",,,Product Specialist/Sales,Former Employee,"Las Vegas, NV","March 2, 2022"

1.0,Everything was great just management and over kill on micromanagement,"Pay starts at 16.00. You choose between schedules, a lot of good options. The trainer was amazing then it ends when your dumbed into production with a not so nice TL. They say they don't micromanage but they definitely do to the extreme and I never have done call avoidance or gave them any reason but still rode my back. Then it turned to my internet had to be messed up. My internet was fine and still fine. Just wasn't for me.

Could pay more, but can't beat the flexibility, benefits and culture. I think they're working on the pay.",,,Manager,Former Employee,Remote,"March 1, 2022"
4.0,Coworkers were amazing. Management was extremely out of touch though.,I enjoyed the time I spent at Apple as a specialist. My coworkers were amazing people and very supportive. It never felt like we were competing with each other. Management was a different story. The company intentionally hired out of company for leadership and when one of us did get promoted to a leadership position (which was rare) they were transferred to another store. This made management extremely out of touch with us and likely to corporate easier to manipulate to go along with whatever initiative they were trying.,,,Specialist,Former Employee,"Woodmere, OH","March 1, 2022"
5.0,Best Experience of my life,"I truly want to work nowhere else after these past four months as a temporary seasonal employee with Apple. The diversity, the inclusion, the feedback, the teamwork, the vision we all strive for was always in sync. I hate that they didn't have enough spots to hire me on. But I will continue to apply until I can become a permanent employee. I do hope to be back at some capacity and continue to develop and find growth in the company. Everyday I walked away knowing I had helped many people in our community no just buy products. But I got to do so much more then that. We brought back hope in a helpless situation. We provided some advice to improve your security and protect your family. We helped you regain those memories you thought you lost, then taught you how to turn them into a masterpiece. I can't wait, to get a call saying we would like to invite you once again to an interview!

It brought so much joy working with our community in that capacity.",,,Specialist,Former Employee,"Oklahoma City, OK","March 1, 2022"
4.0,"Team-orientated, fast-paced and time critical","Working at the Genius Bar is a very wholesome role, the colleagues around you are extremely supportive and there's always someone you can ask for guidance. Management can be scarce during parts of the day which is difficult with escalations.
Salary - very good in relation to retail",,,Technical Expert,Current Employee,"Stratford, Greater London","March 1, 2022"
4.0,At Home Advisor,"It's cool to work at Apple to get them on your resume. Don't expect many opportunities to advance from your role as Apple hires only experienced people for openings. They typically pay 20% higher than the competition, so that helps with retention. However, the ever-changing schedule (you bid on a shift every three months) is a problem for those of us with families.",,,AppleCare Senior Advisor,Current Employee,"Austin, TX","March 1, 2022"
5.0,Great Company and very understanding,"When I caught Covid and had to be out of work, it was an instant “Ok stay safe, don’t worry you’ll still be getting paid your normally 40 week pay”. When I got injured they did everything they could to have me work but follow the doctors order and when there wasn’t something I could actually do, they helped me set up workers comp and short term disability. They checked up with me to see how I was doing but I never felt they were trying to rush me back.",,,Customer Relations Representative,Former Employee,"Austin, TX","February 28, 2022"

3.0,"Great coworkers, really tough and stressful job.","The job is okay. If you have thick skin then go for it.

5.0,One of the best employers in the world.,"Seasonal Specialist is a busy role, especially working in a city which has nearly 20M population but only has one Apple store.

5.0,Store Culture makes a huge impact,"All depending on the people you work with, and where you are in the store. When I first started the store was a fun place and coming to work everyday wasn't a drag. Towards the end, it became a drag, due to poor management.

4.0,"Good place to work, limited room for growth","Having worked here some years, after some time the roles you are able to attain can top out. The role I held became one of monotony. Same thing everyday, with little room for change. There is a big issue with lack of training on entry level support teams. Which impacts someone in my role with the need to do the entry level duties along with your personal senior level duties. For many this can be stressful and cause you to feel as though more workload is sent your way then it should be. Be wary of the department you choose to venture into, while you may excel and exceed in one. In another you may be come stagnant and unable to break through.",,,AppleCare Senior Advisor,Former Employee,Remote,"February 20, 2022"
5.0,Ok,"Once you are out of the haziness of ""I work at Apple"" you start to see so much clearer.

Coworkers are amazing (at least at my location) but management is all performative. You are not actually rewarded for doing your job and there is no actual flexibility (ie a work life balance). I was a PART TIME employee and was told I couldn't work actual part-time hours; I was basically forced to work just under FULL-TIME hours but wasn't compensated as such.

I had so much fun meeting and talking to customers and fellow co workers. Everyday I learned something new and always strived to be the best version of myself.

4.0,Good company to work for with an outstanding amount of benefits,"I really like working for Apple in general but I often feel like managers choose favorites.
If you don't kiss up to those in higher positions you're unlikely to be promoted to the next role.

1.0,Extremely stressful demanding.,"Your scope of support will be huge, you will receive ridiculous trainings that won't make you ready for the job, since their mentality is ""learn as you work. Any job in Apple Care will be the most stressful job you have ever had. The demanding is too much. The interest for the mental health of the advisor is ZERO. You will finish your shift so exhausted that you won't be able to do anything else. You will get mostly depressed throughout the experience, but you will find hard to start looking for another job because you have no energy. There is no amount of money that worths your depression. Apple is a company that promote employee's wellness but the truth is that they have no interest in your wellness, but what they care about is only stats. You will find very hard to have a career unless you have friends inside. When you want a promotion, the management will set up an interview for you, but in most cases they already know who are going to hire, there is no respect for you in this circumstance, but they call you for the internal interview only because legally must give you the chance if you have the skills requested. Working in Apple Care would ruin your life and would make you feel powerless. People take very easily a nervous breakdown. If you have the chance and you are not desperate, choose another company to work for, don't make a terrible mistake.",,,SPS Technical Support Advisor,Former Employee,"Cork, County Cork","January 30, 2022"
3.0,"Read The Verge article called ""APPLE’S FRONTLINE EMPLOYEES ARE STRUGGLING TO SURVIVE"" Article is scary accurate on work culture.","Working here started off good, but slowly has sucked the soul out of me. For a retail job, the benefits are great and you are being payed above average. However, we are not compensated for the amount of work we do and the amount of stress we endure. Hiring and moving up is so confusing because leadership will promote employees that hit metrics, but are actually terrible at their job. Their priorities are obvious and are hindering the Genius Bar. Not everything is bad though. I have felt super close with my coworkers and, at times, I felt more supported by them than by leadership. I do like that giving feedback is a priority though. When co-workers are receptive, it can be beneficial. Hardest part of my job is going to work. Once I am there, I can start appointments. Wish it was better because I love my job and connecting with customers, but store culture has ruined it for me.",,,Technical Specialist,Current Employee,"Los Angeles, CA","January 30, 2022"

2.0,Totally overrated,"Working for Apple is sold as “the best work of your life” - it was far from it.
From the very beginning assuming positive intent is drummed into your head - which is part of the so called ‘apple culture’. This made up for patronising behaviour throughout the few cliques in the store.
You are started as a temp, only to be asked to re interview for a permanent position - which is utterly ridiculous.
Leadership team pretend they want to help you progress, but quite subtly favourite people.
If you’re looking for stability in a job, this is a very big risk to take - especially in these times.",,,Specialist (temporary),Former Employee,"Brighton, East Sussex","January 25, 2022"

4.0,Light work for good money,"Apple was a perfect position for me during my college years. Standard retail hours as a part time employee, but management was always open to allowing more hours if I asked.

I do find that I prefer weekends off to be with family and that didn't work well for me. Coworkers were amazing and Apple does a great job with who they choose to hire. I have met some of the most incredible people. However, it is still retail and you will deal with all the negative that comes with that.

3.0,"Incredibly boring, robotic work with little interest and very little support right now","I actually really don't mind the work of the Annotation Analyst position. It's very boring, I feel like a robot most of the time, and the management team really downplays that during onboarding/training. There are some wonderful people here, but it's frustrating to have an algorithm determine your job success. Although for now we're working from home, they're very excited to get us back to the office so they can begin typical micromanaging. The pay raise ($21/hour now for base) was really nice, but Apple is a place for ~innovators~ and ~inspiration~ which the company emphasizes... but it feels extremely fake coming from basically a content review/tagging job.

4.0,A place you can easily get comfortable.,"Kind of cult-like atmosphere where the answer to every question is always ""tHe cReDo.""

The pay is fair for not requiring a college degree, and if you come in and do your work, you'll be able to move up if you're on the Genius Services side of things.

4.0,Fun if you can ignore the flood of corporate kool-aid.,"The people I worked with were genuinely lovely human beings. However, after you get used to the fact that you’re one of the few fairly compensated retail employees it’s difficult to find the company’s aggressive positivity anything but toxic.

4.0,"Well-paid, fun workplace but very fast-faced and some less positive aspects.","Management is good and supportive. They are very understanding and aren't constantly hounding you about your sales.

Inconsistency with the rules can be very frustrating and you could be doing something the way you were instructed to do it and then one day be told not to do it that way anymore because the rules change constantly. Can make you feel like you're a bad employee for doing what you think is right just because it's hard to keep up with the constant changes.

Very cliquey and people will gossip about you, even if you keep to yourself, so it kind of feels like you're back in high school.

1.0,All Communication is Through the Grapevine,"Management lacks communication skills, tends to gossip with their favorite employees. Extremely difficult to change positions, move up, take time off, etc. Management tends to focus on your wording and story-telling skills rather than reason or logic when it comes to making decisions regarding your schedule or position. Workload is pushed onto the few people who WILL do the work, while all other employees and management hangout in the back of the store.

4.0,"Poor management, good benefits/ peers","Most managers never worked as a retail staff in their whole life, most of them don't start their way as a apple specialist, instead they were given managers role with their MBAs, their ""knowledge"" never meets real working place challenges.
Those who did work their way up either got their role by bad-mouthing other specialist or frame others to do some time consuming but small figures sales while snatching away all big spending resellers.
Senior managers are even worst, they cannot separate business from personal feelings, and they very unprofessionally treat any cases with reflection/ discrimination/ stereotype on any members of staff.",,,Specialist,Former Employee,Hong Kong,"December 8, 2021"

3.0,Not as special as you think,"The employees are what make it better*. I worked in a very large, high demand, Apple store. It really felt like high school. Cliques, the permanents vs the temps. Pro’s/Experts are at the top of the pyramid. Management is cool, sometimes. Never got coached on how to grow. Had my own manager but they rarely ever connected with me and I as well never did with them. They expect you to go to them (what’s the point of being a manager if you can’t manage your employees.) They pin everyone against each other for the desirable positions. Told you’re not good enough constantly. Always told ways to improve but rarely ever acknowledge your already done hard work. Would I want to do this for the rest of my life? no. Did I care? At the beginning yes but as time went on, no. Did I live out a dream I’ve always had? Absolutely. Is it just a regular basic job with the same story of over worked employees with bad management? lol, yes.",,,Product Zone Specialist,Current Employee,"New York, NY","December 5, 2021"
2.0,"Apple. Great Tech company, but….",In store training did not prepare you for the reality of the sales floor. Way to many managers. Some really have attitudes.

1.0,The culture has grown toxic,"The culture has grown toxic!
After working for Apple for many years I seen a vast change in the company as it was handed from one CEO to another. They used to care about the culture and making sure employees felt valued. Now it is just a money making machine, that puts employees health and well-being late. The last conversation I had in a download, a manager advised us that it was OK for customers to yell at us and take out their frustrations. We would just have to deal with it.

Obviously no job is perfect and you will always find pros and cons for every job but i definitely feel like the pros outweigh any cons. The benefits are really good and also the pay. Pay will vary on what position you have. Customer service is the main focus on the job so there will be days where you interact with not the nicest people but you always have support. It’s like a second family for me. Even if there are issues you always have a place to be able to talk about it and managers will do their best to make a solution.

2.0,"Benefits and pay is good, but the culture…","The culture is horrible. You’re expected to live and breathe work if you’re sales. They tell you to be open and give the best option to the customer… so long as it boosts your numbers. Everything is tracked and they pay very close attention. If you want a generally tight knit culture and sales focused job, go for it. There’s options for upward mobility but managers often will not help you succeed. If you’re neurodivergent, I honestly do not recommend applying. Overwhelming and managers are only willing to work with your needs a couple of times before it becomes a problem for them.",,,Sales Specialist,Current Employee,"Lake Grove, NY","November 25, 2021"

1.0,Backstabbers,Be careful who you talk to. Things come back to bite you when you least expect it. The favoritism shown is terrible. The company and customers both suffer.,,,Technical Specialist,Former Employee,Massachusetts,"November 23, 2021"
4.0,Great but lots of underlying problems,As a retail job it definitely lies in the better side of things. Pay is way above average retail and benefits are astoundingly great. The biggest downside comes with the territory of working for huge companies. There isn't a ton of opportunity for upwards mobility. The interview process for internal positions lean more on the interview itself and not the work an individual has done to prove themselves which can be a downside for those that get nervous for interviews but have excellent on the job performance. Overall I think it's a great place to work for but doesn't have the qualities for longevity. The pay inequality is extreme in all departments. There are people that have less than 3 months in the role making the same as tenured employees that have been there 3+ years. The environment strongly discourages employees discussing pay differences as well.,,,Genius Administrator,Current Employee,"Lehigh Valley, PA","November 23, 2021"

1.0,Never judge a book by the cover,"Customer service is already challenging itself as job, work straight after having revived a full immersion training designed with almost 0 practice, been asked at the end to deal with client about everything. You’ll work already on the same other colleague volume, on a very strict schedules, break and lunch are decided and scheduled on a shift and if you won’t respect that and get a break when you’re not intended to, your manager will tell you that software are tracking time you work and if you miss anything on the schedule your bonus and performances will be effected at the end of the year. Therefore if you have an emergency and need to step out from the desk, good luck ! Poor management, poor poor engagement, no practice, you’ll be left in the ocean of customer complaining for the ridiculous policy with a simple iPhone, and you’ll got also feedback and quality valuation at the end of the day as calls are listened by other people. I’m developing anxiety every day more without feeling belongings but more feeling not belonging.

3.0,It's a job,"It's an okay place to work while looking for another job. Don't get too attached to anyone or work too hard, because they'll expect more out of you for nothing in return.

5.0,Great company,"Apple has a great culture and emphasis on work-life balance. There is a bit of an imbalance in the work ethic of employees, and there is limited ability to enforce standards on those who are not willing to pull their weight. On top of that, Apple is less and less willing to offer permanent flexible working arrangements and at-home positions. Compensation is also often disparate for many with the same roles and responsibilities.",,,Project Manager,Current Employee,AHA,"November 11, 2021"

5.0,Amazing retail job,Wish I’d started working at Apple as a young 20 something- it’s an amazing place to work if you want to be apart of something big and powerful in the retail world.

2.0,"Stable company, terrible pay","Apple pays so bad it makes you want to do your least. The benefits are ok (not better than any startup) but the pay is terrible.

1.0,Definitely won't be back!,"If you don't want to have a life outside of work, this place will work for you. Management is all over the place, safety is not thoroughly addressed, therefore slip ups in the warehouse are prone to occur. The only upside to Apple was the huge cafeteria and amazing food selections for their employees. They also have gym equipment in the building and tons of vending machines. Apple definitely feeds their people!",,,IOS Tech Support,Former Employee,"Elk Grove, CA","November 4, 2021"
1.0,A company that wants to pretend that is is perfect,"It has been a long journey through Apple—from applying to Apple regularly starting in high school, to finally getting that call almost a decade later in May 2020. I took pride in my work, won an award for my performance, and exceeded expectations on all annual review metrics. I've gotten to see a vibrant and wonderful part of this company where people are hopeful, support each other, and work incredibly hard.

But I also got to see things that started to concern me—a lack of flexibility that seems to permeate throughout the company and stifle innovation and opportunity. Apple has continued to push in-office work as mandatory for the vast majority of roles. I've now received a call with a single offer, take it or leave it, work the same job you've been working from home—except move across the state to an area with incredibly high cost of living to do it—except now, with a ""small pay increase.""  Unless I get another offer, if I do not accept this ""opportunity,"" my only choice is to leave the company. I can't say how many times I've heard the phrase ""I wish I could do more for you"" come from management or recruiters. The offer I've been given would be forcing me to make a self-destructive financial decision exclusively to please Apple. I am concerned that Apple is only investing in its employees when it is convenient, and I believe that Apple can and should do better than that.",,,AppleCare College At-Home Advisor,Current Employee,"Huntersville, NC","November 3, 2021"
4.0,Fun place to work,"I liked working for Apple as a student (College Program). The pay was good, and they also reimbursed annually for school expenses. Great experience and good name to have on your resume",,,Technical Support Advisor,Former Employee,Remote,"November 3, 2021"

3.0,Could be a good job depending on the role you have,"I work as a tech support advisor in the College Program working from home. Basically a call center job. It gets boring fast. It is nice that I can pick my own schedule that works with classes during the week, but the weekend shifts are a struggle. You pick your schedule for the school semester and that's the schedule you are stuck with for the rest of the semester. They make the majority work an 8hr shift on Saturdays...every Saturday. Only a select few can work Sundays or a split shift (4hrs Saturday and Sunday) on the weekend you don't get to pick your hours you get a random shift and that's what you get. With the college program you would think getting days off would be easy since college life can be hectic, but no. They have this thing called Group Allowance which is a set of hours per day ex: 112hrs for that day someone takes 4hrs PTO it goes down to 109hr left. When it reaches 0 you cannot get that day off regardless of how many PTO hours you have. So say goodbye to school events, volunteer opportunities, visiting family, and social life. Because it takes 2 months to rack up 8 hrs of PTO (the length of 1 Saturday shift) by the time you need a day off the group allowance is already gone. While here they also implemented this change where if you temporarily move back home (like over winter break) they can decrease your pay based on the cost of living.","work from home, good pay raises",work/life balance,College Advisor,Current Employee,"Austin, TX","November 2, 2021"

3.0,Depends on what city you work in,"It really does depend on which store.

1.0,A gimmicky waste of time,"The Apple Culture is a farce and you don’t grow unless you know someone on the inside.

4.0,Probably the best call center job you can get,"Great company and they take pride in the culture. Working on campus was pretty relaxed. Has a good cafe, coffee stations and food bars everywhere, has a health center and gym on campus. Before Covid, there were monthly events like Beer bashes, pot lucks with your teams, themed events with catering companies to feed employees, etc. The one downside to working on campus would be that theres constant change. You may have a different manager or team every few months depending on what the company needs.

3.0,Creative and inclusive but the pay is awful,"Great company if you want to work somewhere diverse. At least at my location since it was in NY, worked with ppl from all backgrounds and ages. Even had a coworker who retired but got bored and picked up some shifts here to stay busy, he was 75. The pay however is disgusting for the amount of work you put in.

There is good insurance and 401k. The managers are very nice and understanding if something comes up where you need time off. You did have some unhappy customers calling in at times, but with the support and weekly training you receive, you learn to be able to help the customers and end up with a positive experience.

3.0,Public perception different than reality,Working here is different than public perception. Company creates great products that enable remote working but CEO & HR will not allow employees to work remote.

4.0,Fun but stressful,"The job overall was a great learning experience. The pay was definitly higher than the average entry level job, and the benefits were extremely helpful! (gym, phone, product discounts) The experience you have is mostly driven by management. I spent the first five years loving the job and really thriving due to the connection managers I had.

5.0,Fun workplace,"It's definitely a great working environment and there really isn't much micromanaging. The days can be repetitive though and you can sometimes serve as the punching bag for a customer but your leads/managers are there to take over and let you take time to breathe and get your composure back before going back to the sales or whatever it is you're doing. Advancement within the company is pretty difficult unless you're a favorite then you should be good, but they tend to not care about your skills and experience in the role you go for and go with someone who has no experience in the role. There are good vibes in your everyday life and you get to meet some awesome people and you're automatically considered family at your retail store.",,,Sales,Current Employee,United States,"October 13, 2021"

4.0,The Overall,"First off, this is a call center/tech support role. If you don't like talking to people on the phone, you don't want to work in this role. This is a great job if you learn your stuff and don't freak out on the phone. Use your resources and solve the problems.

Work schedule depends on how well you do. It's essentially a bidding system. The best employee (by metrics) gets first pick and trickles down. So if you do your job well, it's great!

I enjoyed the managers I worked for and the people in my teams.

4.0,Decent Retail,Apple is a great place if you love meeting several new people all day. Between colleagues and customers you are interacting and meeting folks all day.

BUT,

ZERO ZERO ZERO work/life balance. Execs have been saying for YEARS that they understand and will make it better. But in actuality, it gets worse every year! It is obviously top management LIP SERVICE because if they meant it, they could fix it tomorrow. They have hundreds of BILLIONS in the bank.

3.0,"Great company, lazy leadership",Apple is a great company and truly takes care of their employees. I’ve always had enough sick time and if I need to leave early or anything I was always met with understanding. But I’ve also been a top performer in my market for years and am not given promotions. Growth at Apple is completely ambiguous and there’s not rhyme or reason why one person grows while another doesn’t. You can’t be with the company 10 years and not be promoted even if your hitting all your goals. Leaders are no help in development and simply say whatever they can to get you to just sell more phones. Never felt like any feedback I got ever pushed me or helped me grow,,,Pro,Current Employee,Wyoming,"October 3, 2021"

Con:
My department makes you unable to complete your tasks;
And if you miss the target by 1 case, the entire management team will follow you until you provide a time slot breakdown of what you did for the entire day;
Good managers will help you out, not so good managers will trap you;
Good co-workers will help you out, not so good co-workers will trap you, too;
People mostly help each other and they're good folks, but no one cares about the job itself - we only care about the timecard and your daily mission. The departmental benefits and pay are cut down year by year because this department wants to be mechanical customer service.",,,App Store Review,Current Employee,"Cupertino, CA","October 1, 2021"
5.0,Fun people of various backgrounds at work,"Apple staffs are made up of creative people and who are technologically savvy and trending. Its a good environment to network with fellow workers, that can lead to future relationships after time at Apple.",,,Apple Specialist,Current Employee,"Short Hills, NJ","October 1, 2021"
5.0,good pay but sometimes stressful,very results oriented which makes it a little stressful but overall my favorite work experience ever.,,,Specialist,Former Employee,Massachusetts,"September 30, 2021"
5.0,"Great culture, opportunities to learn, top notch training","Working at Apple was a great experience overall. I began working there during college, and only recently resigned after graduating and feeling the need for new growth opportunities. Training was excellent from the start, as product knowledge is always something that can be taught if you are willing to take the time to learn. Training continues regularly as new product and OS releases arise. I also had the opportunity to work as a product zone specialist, technical specialist, and an Apple at Home advisor, learning how to sell Apple Products, troubleshoot them, and provide over the phone technical support.

Team members are overall very open and available if you need support, and are typically always willing to assist if you are having difficulties achieving metrics, or need advice on how to learn and grow.

Management can vary depending on the team, but they are overall willing to assist you with career goals. One downside however is due to Apple’s mantra of not being focused on numbers, advancement opportunities can often be provided towards those better at “telling stories” of their work, rather than those who have better knowledge and records of success. There is overlap in these people most of the time so it is not a dramatic issue, and storytelling is an important skill to have in any industry. That said, if you are more introverted, or someone who is more focused on putting their head down and working, than you may have a harder time.",,,Technical Specialist,Former Employee,Apple Retail,"September 30, 2021"
5.0,Decent,Not a bad place to work if you're just coming out of college. I only had a contract but I was paid decent and there were some convenient perks. Hope for more opportunities,,,DATA IMAGERY EDITOR,Former Employee,"Cupertino, CA","September 29, 2021"
5.0,Love working here,"Best place to work. great benefits.

you learn a lot about technical stuff like how to identify and fix issues with technology. Culture is great too YAYA",,,Specialist,Former Employee,"Aventura, FL","September 29, 2021"
3.0,"Very demanding culture, not much appreciation for contractors","They demand a lot of workers, especially contractors who get no benefits like healthcare, PTO, raises, etc. But they don't appreciate the work and time contractors put in. They're always looking to reduce contractors, rather than converting them to FTE. It can lead contractors to feel strung along, exploited, and that their time was wasted. Project teams like to invent work to justify their jobs, constantly retiring internally used apps and software and releasing new (nearly identical) apps and software. Management cultivates a culture of terrible communication - it's ok to ignore people's emails. At the same time, Slack is pushed all day long, so people can ignore you there too. They seem to throw money in places it's not needed, while cheaping out on expenses that are desperately needed. Also, beware of narcissistic, abusive management who push certain politics. Ultimately, they don't treat people well because they don't have to. Many people are dying to work at Apple. If you do, it will be very difficult. But your resume will benefit for sure.",,,Writer,Former Employee,Utah,"September 29, 2021"
3.0,fun young culture/ lots of oppurtunity,overall i think of apple as a pretty great company to work for i would just tell folks not to work in isolated stores. the stores far away (an hour or more) away from other stores tend to have very stagnant culture little opportunity and un developed leadership. often times these people re just the ones who hung around for a very long time and saw the actual talent leave for larger stores or corporate. if you can get into Cupertino or a flag ship store you can usually get some great opportunities,,,Sales Specialist,Former Employee,"Buffalo, NY stamford CT","September 29, 2021"
4.0,Good place to learn and grow,Overall I love the job that I do working at Apple. The team that I work with is outstanding. I love to meet new people and working with people and I always say that I get paid to talk. I do believe however there are times when things can get stressful and being retail when you are working full time work/life balance can be tough to achieve.,,,Expert,Current Employee,"Manhattan Beach, CA","September 28, 2021"

5.0,Awesome,"Awesome place. Energetic caring, motivating supervisors who care about you as a person and not just a tool which they use to grow the bottom line. Must stay",,,Associate,Current Employee,"New York, NY","September 28, 2021"
5.0,A great place to work,Apple is one of the best companies ive ever worked for. They take care of their employees. Management is also awesome and whatever you ask they try to accomdate.,,,Operations Specialist,Former Employee,The Westchester,"September 27, 2021"
4.0,"Only for teams, eligible people .","If you produce, bring something good to the company and work hard and say yes to everything they ask you to do you might be likely to be promoted and with good pay, if not then you be there with no promotion and less than 2% pay raise every year.",,,Security Officer,Current Employee,"Cupertino, CA","September 26, 2021"
2.0,Too much work and managers are not interested in daily issues between employees,Managers get all the rewards while the grunts doing the work get little to no bonus or stock. When I asked how to achieve the next level in pay the manager had no solid answer or plan to get there. It was a very subjective process.,,,Senior Model Maker,Former Employee,"Cupertino, CA","September 24, 2021"
4.0,"Overall great, pros and cons for retail environment","Benefits at Apple are pretty spectacular and they offer benefits for part time employees. There are a lot of great initiatives like volunteer work and inclusion and diversity. The jobs themselves in the retail stores tend to be stressful. (I have worked several different positions) There is a heavy emphasis on the customer first even if the customer is being rude or unreasonable. There is a lot of room for movement both internally in the stores and externally to corporate roles so that’s a plus. Overall I’ve had a great experience with my management teams and fellow co-workers. My biggest con would be the work life balance. During major product launches and holiday season, expect to be working often, on weekends, and potentially not getting some time off approved. Unfortunately shifts are not promised for certain dates or times, as to be expected in retail, but someone who is working until 11 pm shouldn’t have to return at 7/8 am the next day.

Overall, if you have a passion for Apple products and services, you will enjoy working there. Most days were fun and there is a general upbeat vibe. The pros definitely outweigh any cons if you find the right role for you and I am grateful for my experience with the company.",,,Genius Administrator,Former Employee,Virginia,"September 24, 2021"
5.0,Long and demanding hours,"Good pay and benefits but long hours are very demanding and they require weekends and most holidays. Other than long hours, the job is very rewarding",,,Specialist,Current Employee,"Thousand Oaks, CA","September 24, 2021"

2.0,Love the employees ; hated the management.,"The team and culture is an amazing , very laid back place to work. I hate most most my management. They didn't really care about my growth. they just wanted to give ""fearless feedback"" all day. Never you're doing great just "" Your terrible """,,,Lead Customer Specialist,Former Employee,Texas,"September 23, 2021"
5.0,Awesome,"I would definitely love to work there again. They were inclusive, fair, informative, and always eager to teach and grow. I would reccomend anyone to apply.",,,Apple Sales Specialist,Former Employee,"New York, NY","September 23, 2021"
3.0,Retail employment with corporate expectations,"I've worked across multiple retail locations with Apple and it's apparent how differently each store can operate based on the workforce and leadership employed. Ultimately, it's a retail job in big tech with a decent benefits package, but operating with retail hours, no commission, no bonuses, and expectations that are increasingly difficult to exceed. I don't agree with how the pandemic has been handled at the retail level. The company boasts that it values its people, but the action (or inaction) to protect and value retail employees has been disappointing.",,,Genius Admin,Current Employee,"New York, NY","September 22, 2021"
4.0,"A lot of creativity within the workers. Local managers, I've heard, can be very hard on employees, putting pressure on them to act out of character","After 15 years working at Apple Offices, I can confidently say that I enjoy working for Apple. Sometimes hours are tough, but overall I give Apple a good rating",,,Design Specialist,Former Employee,California,"September 22, 2021"
4.0,Great place to work,"I've been there for 6 years and love it. Though, raises could be better, but I am happy there. The work life balance is good and the benefits are great. I just wish the yearly raises were better.",,,At Home Advisor,Former Employee,"Chesterfield, MI","September 22, 2021"
2.0,Apple is like that ex you should have left,The pay is OK to start but it is difficult to advance in the company. The managers micromanage and screen watch all the time. There is absolutely no work life balance they do not care if you have children with special needs. They expect you to meet your KPI‘s a monthly even though their scaling system is flawed and no one is willing to fix it. Not much time off the phone. When new products are announced you won’t know until a week later. The managers do not know any technical portion of the job they just know how to manage and they do a poor job at it. When I first started this job I loved it but with all the unnecessary changes they make constantly I’ve grown to hate my job. The pay is not worth what you will go through or the stress.,,,AppleCare Advisor,Current Employee,Remote,"September 22, 2021"
5.0,Incredible Values!,"Working at Apple is very different from working anywhere else. The company itself puts there people at the forefront being aware of the hard work that goes into selling their products everyday.
Area for improvement would definitely be improved pay for those in retail being that they are the ones who are customer facing day in and day out as well as the revenue that is brought in via Retail Stores.
Besides that I believe with a 4 day work week there wouldn’t be a better place to work.",,,Specialist,Current Employee,"Elmhurst, NY","September 22, 2021"

5.0,Great company to work for. Even better people.,"You are actually part of a team that works together to meet daily objectives that reflect on the big picture. Overtime is never mandatory and is always voluntary. Weekends off for most, depending on the department. Some of the best benefits I’ve ever had from an employer. This is one of the best companies I’ve ever worked for. Compensation is competitive based on local pay rates.",,,Logistics Integration Center Lead,Current Employee,"Maiden, NC","September 16, 2021"
4.0,Good place if you know what you're doing,If you can work your way up its a good place to be. A bit hard if you are just starting out but you will find people that are willing to take you under their wing and teach you the in's and outs.,,,Tech Support Specialist,Former Employee,"Lake Mary, FL","September 16, 2021"
3.0,Don't judge a book by its cover,"Apple is fantastic at advertising a product as cutting edge. People swallow it up and continue shelling out money for their products. Features touted as cutting edge are features that for example have been available for Android phones for 4 or 5yrs. Folks don't know any better as they have never used an Android before and thus continue spending money on features that are really just old hat. The culture there is similar. On the outside it appears as though everything is carefree and roses, but the reality is that you are held to very strict metrics. If you can't deliver, you are fired. This is of course after a warning or two, but the writing is on the wall at that point. You are told it's about the customers, but in the end it's about the bottom dollar. They lose many great employees that ACTUALLY care about the customer due to their unwillingness to budge on ensuring that the customer is taken care of, even at the cost of a metric. Their are those like myself who are willing to stay late to call a customer back when they are off work and home even if it means clocking back in later to make that happen or to make good on a promise made. THIS is what the job should be about, and it isn't. Disappointing to say the least.",,,"Network Admin, Senior Technical Support & Mentor",Former Employee,"Eugene, OR","September 16, 2021"
3.0,Management will make or break your experience,"I worked at two different locations and my experiences were like night and day. Management will really dictate the environment. The company as a whole is a great place to work, but it all depends on the store you’re at. Both of the Cleveland stores have poor management.",,,Specialist,Former Employee,"Cleveland, OH","September 15, 2021"
4.0,walk their talk about diversity and inclusion,"I'm in Apple Stores, so the pressure to sell is relentless but not oppressive. The company is an environmental leader, and really emphasizes diversity and inclusion. Doesn't provide me with sufficient intellectual challenge, but that's par for the course with retail.",,,Sales Associate,Current Employee,Massachusetts,"September 14, 2021"
2.0,Excessive pressure to perform Sales,"Sadly, Apple loves to tout how good they are to their employees with all of the perks the job offers, while leaving out that you have zero representation as an employee! The burden of setting up your 'discounts' and benefits from Apple involves copious amounts of time and energy in order to receive them. T-Mobile, for example, promises Apple employees a 75% off per line discount off their personal service. After 3 months of trying, I finally gave up. Apple DID NOTHING. Apple has decided to be complicit in the COVID technology psyop. Bad form, bad move. I left Apple on good terms. I won't work for businesses that have lost touch with their customer base. This is one of them. A massive exodus is occurring here. Don't be surprized.",,,Retail Specialist,Former Employee,"Atlanta, GA","September 13, 2021"

3.0,AppleCare Home Advisor,"I was an AppleCare Home Advisor for nearly 5 years. I started in the college program and was told that there was tons of opportunity for advancement. Once I graduated, they stopped hiring full time advisors and called us “part-time pro” advisors with an approximate $1 raise. During my college days we were only hired as part time employees but we had an option to work extra hours if we wanted. For the first 2 years, while in school, I picked up as many hours as possible. I was there when needed and then some. I’ve hosted team meetings, created helpful job aids, took no time off.

I had about 4 or 5 managers, during my time with the company. Each one promised they would help me find a new position, where I could be hired as a full time employee. Those promises never came through, we were all just passed around like chess board pieces.

I started noticing the lack of mobility within the role and eventually I started to hate my job. When I was moved over to my last manager, I got the same promises. At nearly every meeting, I’d bring it up and get the same beat around the bush response.

I worked hard to land this role when I was in school and I did not want to give up. I was with my last manager for just over 2 years. Nearing the end, I let him know that I didn’t know how much longer I could be apart of Apple. “I understand” or “stick with it a little longer” or “things will get better.”

In the end, after fighting so hard for a position in the company, I decided to leave. My manager didn’t bother asking me to stay, didn’t fight to keep me on. That’s when I knew it was my time",,,AppleCare At-Home Advisor,Former Employee,Florida,"September 8, 2021"
4.0,Good Enviroment,"Apple managers for the College Program are very encouraging and helpful. Apple provides full corporate benefits to part-time employees; alongside, a generous discount and other resources to improve employees' health and wellbeing. However, the job can be strenuous as you're on the phone talking directly to customers who can use you as a therapist, doctor, or punching bag and there does not seem to be much room for growth outside the call center.",,,Technical Support Specialist,Former Employee,Remote,"September 8, 2021"
1.0,Backstabbers,Be careful who you talk to. Things come back to bite you when you least expect it. The favoritism shown is terrible. The company and customers both suffer.,,,Technical Specialist,Former Employee,Massachusetts,"September 7, 2021"
5.0,Great Culture,The job can be overwhelming due to back to back calls. But over it was worth it. They take really great care of their employees. I really enjoyed being part of the culture,,,Tier 1 Technical Support,Former Employee,Remote,"September 7, 2021"
4.0,A Great Place to Work if You Come In With A Plan,It’s a good place to work. The pay is pretty good and the culture is great. Make sure you go in with the intention to move up quickly though because I’ve seen highly skilled people work there 10 years and get passed for promotions while people who’ve only been there 3 months get the job because they’re more like able (new hire glow). After a while it’s easy to get jaded and don’t get comfortable because your favorite parts of Apple may change the next week. Over all it’s a wonderful company to work for but have a plan for where you want to go and stick to it.,,,SPECIALIST,Former Employee,"Aventura, FL","September 3, 2021"
4.0,Good job,"Apple does care about its employees. Beat benefits I’ve ever seen with any company. Apple invests money, time, and resources into its employees for professional and personal growth.",,,Mac + Senior Sup 3,Current Employee,"Austin, TX","September 2, 2021"
5.0,Work ethic among peers,Most of the employees at Apple retail have share a similar attitude towards the workplace and people there. They want to be helpful and know their coworkers ha e their back when they need help - most situations don’t require you to ask.,,,Apple Specialist,Former Employee,"Naperville, IL","September 2, 2021"
5.0,It is what you have heard,"Apple tells you from the beginning that they are about change and from day one to month six you will continue to change day after day. And it will be like that every six months because something is always new. You can rely on not knowing what is coming or what is going on and constantly reacting. And that is what you are being hired to do. This is not a bad thing, this is Apple. They tell you up front. You need to be fast and mentally agile. You need to be resilient because your position is going to be demanding at every level.",,,Senior Advisor,Current Employee,"Augusta, GA","September 1, 2021"

4.0,I worked remote during the fall holiday season,"I should have known what I was signing up for: a lot of reading and learning resources to help any chat customers with all questions Apple. Lots of hard, angry, unknowing customers around back to school, Black Friday, Halloween, Thanksgiving and Christmas. Management just depends on who they are; lots of overtime opportunities for my season.

Word of Advice: Learn all the resources they recommend as quick as you can, and your entire job moving forward will be significantly easier.",,,Apple Chat Customer Service,Former Employee,Remote,"August 30, 2021"
4.0,Ups and Down but overall good,"Some mangers leave more to be desired, others are great. Company is good at training and motivating employees.

2.0,Good product and focus on customer experience,"Apple has changed over the past year, no longer a great company. Focus on political rather than business agenda is disturbing for many on the team but not addressed by leaders. There is no respect for people who think differently than corporate leaders. This is not the ""think different"" Apple of the past. Very sad to see this decline in the company culture.",,,Store Leader,Current Employee,Florida,"August 30, 2021"
4.0,It’s okay,"I worked here for a year and I can’t complain about the company itself, more so the nature of working there.

3.0,Job security,Hard to grow within the company if you’re not connected with the right individuals. The managers have favorites and usually help those move up faster.,,,Technical Specialist,Current Employee,"Rancho Cucamonga, CA","August 29, 2021"
1.0,"Over worked, and under paid. Management does not care about employees.","Any criticisms of the company fall on deaf ears, management will dote on how successful the company was in a quarter, while simultaneously cutting cost to employees and raises. We used to get a very nice dollar or two raise a year. With COVID we got no raises, more work, and management boasted on how successful they were while not compensating the ones working the hardest. On chat support we were expected to work and take 3 chats at a time , while learning and teaching ourselves about new issues. They recently got rid of chat departments in many areas, while the same week holding an announcement that chat was more successful than ever. I've been with the company a long time, and it used to be much nicer. But management has changed, and they don't care about staff happiness any longer, they care about min maxing profits. Why hire 1 person to do a job at a fair rate when you can pay 1 person low wages to do 3 people's jobs? They make you work every holiday, and will not work with you to get a desirable schedule no matter what. Also, you get no way of moving up. There is entry level, and senior support. Once you're there, you're done moving up. They outsource everything now so you won't be managing anyone any time soon.",,,Senior Advisor,Current Employee,Remote,"August 29, 2021"
4.0,Great Management and Benefits,"Apple Offers great benefits, and the management team is always striving to make sure you are working towards your goals and empowering you. I worked phone sales, which is a hard job to do long term. There were not many remote positions available for me to grow into in Software Dev, so I unfortunately had to leave the company.",,,Mac Expert,Former Employee,Remote,"August 29, 2021"

1.0,They expect a lot out of you for little in return,"The work environment is fast paced and they expect you to ""flex"" and ""deal with ambiguity"" non stop. The store is terribly understaffed and the management team does little to nothing while out on the floor other than hold an ipad and tell you youre not working fast enough. If youre lucky enough to get a corporate job experience and leave the store you will be in good shape. The job pays decent and has good benefits, just dont bank on staying in the store long term because it will not pay off and it will be terrible for your mental health.",,,Technical Expert,Current Employee,"Rochester, NY","August 25, 2021"
5.0,Diverse productive environment,Working at Apple was what everyone said it would be. The work environment was extremely drivers and highly productive. They are extremely selective about who they hire and it shows in the quality of people who work there.

5.0,Lots of opportunities,"Apple is a great place to work as long as you set goals and let your managers know what those goals are. I believe they do have a willingness to help you achieve them. The only issue I had was when covid hit but no one could really control that. Everything was a little chaotic with little structure.
I had an opportunity for a career experience 2 years into my life at Apple. I was sent to corporate and honestly didn’t have a great experience there but it was a good thing to put under my belt. Being a Specialist was really fun. Coworkers were awesome. Some customers were difficult but for the most part the job was really rewarding! I would recommend this job to a friend. 9/10",,,Customer Service Specialist,Former Employee,"Portland, OR","August 22, 2021"
1.0,You will have no life,If you decide to work with apple Don’t ever think you have weekends off and if they favoritism you you will have weekends off the management has no communication and you only have communication with your team lead.

4.0,Productive and fun,"It was great working at Apple, it helped me with the antisocial aspect of myself by engaging with thousands of people. Management was always helping and encouraging us, but the amount of workers there prevents you from working a lot of hours. Most of the year you are probably working 20 hours or 15 in a week.

5.0,It’s cool,"First and foremost it’s a retail job, so hours are random, and days off are random too. You can submit an “availability” where you can choose what days to be off so for example Monday and Tuesday but you won’t be able to pick what shift you want, it’s either one or the other. If you have a goal in mind and know what you want to accomplish in your career, and Apple will give you the leg up you need then go for it, but if you don’t know what you want to do as far a career goes, and you just want to work for Apple because it’s Apple you’ll have a hard time here.",,,Genius,Current Employee,"Atlanta, GA","August 18, 2021"
4.0,Amazing company to work for but high stress,"I’ve worked in customer service for years and I must say that the customers I dealt with at Apple were the worst. Always swearing, yelling, or just being rude in general. Apple itself was great to their workers and my team was always nice. You do work pretty much every holiday however and are not allowed to ask for them off but holiday pay is great. If you can deal with high stress calls 8 hours a day then it’s worth it otherwise.",,,Technical Support,Former Employee,Remote,"August 17, 2021"
1.0,Your Job is NEVER Safe.,"Prepare to have your job flipped upside down and changed dramatically.

Every few months there are new rules and expectations slammed down on employees. Most recently advisors who were providing support in a chat based role for 7+ years are now being forced to a phone support role as chat roles are being axed from Apple's customer service options.

Advisors who physically are incapable of speaking are being told ""tough luck"" and are now forced to fine work elsewhere or be demoted with a massive pay reduction.",,,AppleCare Technical Support Advisor,Current Employee,Remote,"August 16, 2021"
5.0,A job you can use to make money and upgrade your soft skills without feeling limited/disouraged,"Working at an Apple store can be one of the most informative jobs a young adult can get. The pay is excellent even at an entry position. The environment is great for those who are naturally social since you're constantly dealing with a lot customers every shift. There's a great deal of emphasis placed on personal development and that's one of the great highlights of working for a company like Apple. Don't get so tied up in the politics of the company. If you do your job and you do it well, along with knowing what you want out of the job will get you very far in the company and fairly quickly. I've never seen people that competent move up that quickly in other companies.",,,TECHNICAL EXPERT,Former Employee,"Mississauga, ON","August 15, 2021"

2.0,Worst place to work at...Cult like mentality,"Long hours and constantly changing schedule. We worked at an R&D black site. My group and co workers were awesome but favoritism towards a handful of the worst in the group created a hostile and unhealthy work environment for the majority of the group. Management is hired according to who they know and not how well they are qualified.

5.0,Great Leadership and Family Oriented environment,Working for Apple is the best retail job I have ever had. It doesn't feel like retail. Customer sometimes come into the store knowing exactly what they want. Some do not ; its easy to gain product knowledge while you're there with the training modules that we have to work on every 2 months or so. Mainly when Apple presents a new product. During the pandemic we were still able to work from home and that says a lot about the company. They care about their employees and will make sure we are taken care of during a International shutdown.

3.0,"Fun place to work at, but becomes spirit crushing over time","It’s honestly a very great place to work in compared to other retail stores, however Apple has become increasingly more “corporate robot” since the pandemic. They preached “your health & safety is our #1 priority” every day since returning in person but there was little action behind those words. It has become increasingly visible that Apple indeed cares more about money and numbers than their employees. There’s less flexibility with work-life balance, stores are too understaffed for the amount of people/“browsers” being let in, and the managers are so preoccupied with their numbers and goals that they take it out on the employees. I used to absolutely love working here. I hope Apple goes back to its roots and has a more human connection/understanding with its employees. Also, I’d rather get a nice chunky raise in my wage than stock that vests over the span of 3 years. That would actually be helpful.",,,Product Zone Specialist,Current Employee,"Newport Beach, CA","August 11, 2021"
3.0,"Stressful, unfair with good benefits. They squish the last drop of you","Stressful environment.
Managers make juicy commissions with YOUR sales e.g Applecare+ They push u for monthly quotas.
They are a W0k3, anti-@merican Co. All is made in China.
They support political agendas that shouldn’t be part of a work place.
You can’t be a conservative there.
To grow in the Co. you need a godfather Mgr. They pick favorite employees and are indulgent with them but with normal employees they are severe.
Lots of gossip and arsse kissers to get promotions.

1.0,It went downhill,"I had worked there for years. It was an amazing company at first. They truly cared about the ""customer journey"". Now its all about numbers! Sell Sell Sell. They don't care about the customer journey anymore. Very little room to grow. Management seems to care when they speak with you about things but don't do anything about it. Managers lack communication with each other and employees get burnt from it. The Leads are a joke. They can't be found anywhere in the store. They need to get it together!! Then certain employees think that the way the store runs should be run by them first as if they are managers or owners of apple. They can't seem to accept that things change and things are never going to be the same. They can't handle ambiguity",Pay.

1.0,Lame Ecosystem,Worst working environment that I ever experienced. Unfair culture and pay. Management sets you up to fail if they don’t like you. Back stabbing immature babies work at Apple.

They're always there when you need them for support. Colleagues were nice and helpful as well. Training was very in depth, as it took about 3-4 weeks to get ready to hit the floor.

4.0,Its retail,"You get a lot of people experience, practice giving bad news, and de-escalating customer issue interactions. Training isn't too bad, was better when I first started but has become more modules based. You work retail hours so that's either a hit or a miss for a lot of people. There are opportunities to move up but most of the time aren't based on performance but, on how well you do on an interview. If you get full time you'll make the most out of your benefits, part time does have some really good benefits but doesn't guarantee you'll work there consistently. Some days you'll only work 4 hours a day or maybe 20 hours a week if things aren't busy.",,,Technical Specialist,Current Employee,"Houston, TX","August 4, 2021"

1.0,The company needs to listen to the employees and contractors WFH requests,"I worked as a linguist contractor for Apple exactly for one day, so I can only speak about the onboarding experience.

Although the project seemed like a perfect fit for someone who specializes in Spanish phonetics, the company is currently and obviously having a lot of issues in terms of remote work policies that will ultimately lead to a loss of talent.

My case is very particular. I hold dual citizenship (USA/Mexico) and I had been approved to work remotely as a contractor. However, living in a border town in Texas, I do have to travel to Mexico pretty often to visit/take care of elderly parents who decided to live in Mexico due to elevated health care costs in the US. When I brought this up, it was unfortunate to learn that it was completely forbidden to work from any other location that was not my address in Texas (not even any other US city if I ever had to travel). So putting family first, as I think we all have learned to value more during this pandemic, I chose to skip this opportunity.

I have been working in the tech industry for a while now and I completely understand how important security is. That being said, I hope that in the future Apple listens to the demands of employees and contractors in term of working remotely and can come up with further security measures (if the ones in place are not enough) to lessen corporate espionage paranoia.

When it comes to linguists who are native speakers of a language other than American English, the private sector (and the government) ought to understand that it is unreasonable for them to expect those same linguists",,,Computational Linguist,Former Employee,Remote,"August 3, 2021"
4.0,It used to be better,"When I first started, this job was the best I could ever hope for or imagine. I never felt like I was working because I loved it so much. However, as time went on, they gave ASC and LASC responsibilities to us with promise of “going above and beyond to show we can move up.” Those positions never opened, and there is zero room for growth. There’s not even room to switch to a full-time position. You get little hours ONLY weekends, and if you need to take it off, full-timers are the only ones who get PTO. You need to take unpaid time away and aren’t allowed to make the day up. Lastly, my pay rate compared to any other company was also very low compared to other companies doing the same position with less of a workload.

2.0,Constantly demanded for more with little to no return,"Working for Apple is not what it used to be. Working on the technical side of the retail establishment you are constantly belittled by customers and undermined by management. Regardless of what attitude management put out there or the company put out there, it’s all about making money. It has always been about making money and that’s all it will ever be about. As a technician you are demanded to Push expensive solutions on customers even though it’s not necessarily what they need.","Guaranteed pay.

4.0,Attainment is Harder than being accepted into Harvard,Apple was a wonderful experience. Hard working and very talented people here. Management is pretty good. Goals are easily attained if you care about your job. Lots of fun experiences available. That said you will be constantly shifting focus on what your job really is! You will regularly be told to handle stuff you have never seen in your life! You will be told to sink or swim and to use the tools they provide you for your answer. This is not an impossible situation but very difficult to accept long term. The more you think you know how to handle a situation the more regularly you will be proven incorrect. You will have constant training that is truly never ending and most of it is self guided online courses.

3.0,Little fish in a big pond,"Just as you’d expect, it is incredibly competitive to move up simply due to the lack of progression available, especially as a work from home employee.

3.0,Good money but lots of unrealistic expectations for work from home,"You make good money but you’re forced to move to different departments, based on business needs. They deny your requests for time off so either have to try and trade or giveaway your day which doesn’t work cause nobody hardly ever picks them up so you either have to get a point or go anyways. If you need to be absent for medical reasons you have to call out every single day you’re out rather than just calling once and saying hey I’ll be back next week on Tuesday. They are very micromanaging, someone is always watching your screen watching every little move you make, which literally takes any possible fun you could have away (keep in mind it’s work from home so the only interaction you can have is through teams on your computer but who wants to chat with a friend when someone is literally reading your conversation) I get that it’s work and you’re supposed to be working and I still work but just like if you were in the actual building it’s okay to have a small side conversation through the day. Especially after a bad call and having to jump right into a new one it’s nice to blow off a little steam in the chat. Over all though it’s very mentally draining you take calls non stop every day, you get a 30 minute coaching and a 30 minute team meeting each week but that’s it the rest of the time it’s back to back calls.",,,Technical Support Representative,Current Employee,"Waynesboro, GA","July 29, 2021"
3.0,Mentally and Emotionally Demanding,"Emotionally and mentally draining, standards and responsibilities are high, even at the retail level; benefits are solid but it can difficult to advance.

3.0,It's okay for a bit,"It's a good job to start off on. Benefits are decent, pay is great for retail. You are disposable though, don't forget that. Essentially invisible unless you mess up, or do something incredible enough to be noticed. It's a job at the end of the day. I just wish they'd be honest about it instead of acting like you're curing cancer for a living. It's just a job, as good or as bad as any other. Hyping it up as anything else just leads to disappointment and resentment from staff. Stop trying to build loyalty through psychological tactics so people feel like they can't leave, it's a company not a cult.

Also, the secretiveness about pay thing is real weird. Especially in the year of our lord 2021. That's how people get exploited and don't even know about it. Also lends more weight to the whole cult thing.

Most of the managers are bad vibes, but again, it's a job, that's not shocking. I think you legally HAVE to be bad vibes to work in management anyways.

I was placed in an apple building but on a floor of just contractors. It was a youthful and fun environment as contractors, but dealing with Apple management was a bit exhausting. They were not always clear in what they expected in terms of work quality and project deadlines, and messages would get lost between Apple management to team leads that were working on your floor. Pay was decent considering the lack of background knowledge and experience needed, training was provided from my role.

You are still expected to drink the Apple Koolaid, and play the corporate politics if you want to get anywhere, but that's the game. Its also worth mentioning that retail work means retail hours.

4.0,"A great place to work, a bad career oriented organization","The critiques of Apple are generally critiques that exist for all of the 'Tech World'. Hard work is often not recognized and you don't always feel appreciated. Subject matter experts are typically not advanced for fear of losing talent. Managers are rarely promoted from within and when they are it is usually not the competent leaders who can coach their team-members, but people who 'network' and lack overall productivity. Many external candidates are hired for management roles and this erodes the culture of the organization, requiring frequent 'resets' every few years as floundering leadership scrambles to address the loss of confidence in their managers.

Apple is a great job, but don't consider it a career. They rarely hire fresh out of college personnel. It should be considered a second workplace option for those who have a few years in tech under their belts, where you can work for a few years and parlay that experience into a better role in another tech organization.","Benefits, team-members, work-life balance","bad management, weak leadership, poor advancement opportunities",AppleCare At-Home Advisor,Current Employee,"Greensboro, NC","July 26, 2021"

3.0,Cool place to work temporarily,"Apple is ummm, complicated. It’s a great atmosphere, but it’s really just comes down to being a retail job and a lot of playing favorites. The store is cool because you meet people from all over the world and get to keep up with the coolest technology. The staff is more diverse than most places and there are so many people who are good at so many things (music, arts, entertainment, photography, etc). Just like any other retail job they need to do better at promoting the right people. The lazies and favorites get promoted while the people who are most resourceful and knowledgeable get pushed aside. You WILL work every weekend and be expected to help a high amount of customers with less than enough staffing. Also if you’re in sales, you will be PT, everyone is. It’s almost, if not, impossible to become FT. There are no bonuses considering you by yourself can make over a million dollars for the store in one year. The products sell themselves. Coworkers are cool too because everyone is around the same age as you between 18-40. Cool place, cool people, cool culture, but the politics just like any other job can ruin the whole experience. I’d def suggest working here, but not getting too lost in the sauce.",,,Specialist,Former Employee,"Jacksonville, FL","July 21, 2021"

1.0,Good pay and benefits because you’ll need them,"The most stressful unsupported position I’ve ever had, expectations are so high that it’s impossible to meet. More and more employees are having mental breakdowns due to the stress, abusive customers and the other expectations that you will be able to “turn around” calls where the customer is belittling you and treating you absolutely awful. Management positions takes years to achieve and only if you know someone same with progressing to any position. Most positions are just in another skill which does not pay more.

I enjoy my discount and other perks from partner companies as well. The downfall is I often feel more like a number rather than an individual and over the years its gotten worse. I hate scheduling because it is a constant change every 90-120 days and it makes it hard having a family with the inconsistency and some what lack of control for set scheduling.",,,AppleCare Senior Advisor,Current Employee,"Columbus, OH","July 13, 2021"
2.0,"Great company to be a part of, little to no room for growth","There’s a reason Apple is one of the (if not the) most innovative companies ever. Things are just done differently at Apple - teams are structured laterally, you’ll often report to multiple managers (without one necessarily being your boss per se) and Apple truly makes groundbreaking products, all while having a strong mission and attention to values. Benefits are all around pretty great as well.

That being said, Apple has grown to the point of bureaucracy. Things move slowly. Little to no flexibility in policies. Often times folks have either only worked at Apple or worked at Apple for so long that they get locked into the “Apple way” as opposed to normal ways of doing things.

It’s a great company to be a fly on the wall in. There’s just little to no room for growth in Retail Business without drinking the proverbial kool aid, and advancement isn’t necessarily based on how well you do your actual work, but how much people know who you are.",,,Business Pro (Senior Retail Account Manager),Current Employee,"San Francisco, CA","July 13, 2021"
5.0,very good company,"Pros

The people. Loved my team of coworkers. Also loved engaging with customers every day and not sitting behind a computer desk like I did in my last few jobs before. The customers, management, and coworkers really made it such a positive experience for me!

Cons

Can be long hours and sometimes have to work overtime because people call out. But that's almost any job. And with great coworkers and managers it makes the time fly by. You do get rude customers from time to time and ones who aren't too happy when you make an error. But you get over it.

Advice to Management

Though I know you need the manpower, respect employees days off as they need to recharge. It sucks always having to think of an excuse when they call and I'm at home or out relaxing on my day off. Dealing with customers nonstop especially at Apple can be draining on a weekend for example.",,,Technical Expert,Current Employee,"Temecula, CA","July 12, 2021"

Managers will go out of their way to make sure that you don't say anything which could indicate that Apple could ever make an incorrect decision, or to spin it on you so that you're wrong. Typical days are long, most customers are fine but when they're difficult they are the absolute worst, management will straight up not give people the boot even when they are being blatantly verbally abusive to staff. Hardest part is just the grind, and being looked at weird when you indicate that you're less than perfectly happy.

Apple does a great job at hiring. It took 4 interviews with 5 different leaders for a part-time retails job. The people I work with are fun to work with and can honestly say there not one single person I do not get along with.

At the end of the day, it is customer service, and no matter where you go customers can be a pain. As a phone advisor, it gets very repetitive and I mostly look forward to times where I'm off the phone. There's a big focus on metrics and meeting certain requirements and some managers can micromanage.

Excellent people are hired for their excellent skills, then are sort of left there in the same role for 5-10 years. It's difficult to move roles and virtually impossible to cross borders and move internationally. This was a deal breaker for me and the reason I left the business. For many people their life long desire is to work at Apple.

Many times I had my schedule availability “rejected” so when I physically couldn’t make shifts because I had classes for school it was then brought up to me as my fault. When I asked to work only weekends for a few months while I completed an internship for school I was told it couldn’t be done. They don’t really observe you either, my manager was barely there when I had a shift so when it came time for my review and something that I needed to “work on"" would come up, it was completely untrue, but they didn’t know that because they never saw me even perform my job.",,,Product Zone Specialist,Former Employee,"Woodcliff Lake, NJ","June 17, 2021"

4.0,I love Apple,"I’ve been with Apple for almost 8 years. It’s a great job with incredible benefits. However- in my role the work is stressful and during launch and peak periods we take on a large workload and work with several customers at a time. I believe we could be compensated more for the work we perform. People are fighting for a greater working wage. All employers should be taking note of this. My only other complaint is that there is no opportunity for advancement into management or leadership roles. They almost always hire from the outside for those roles. I’ve worked in management at jobs that were much more difficult- but I can’t progress at Apple at all. I’m still stuck in an entry level role- which is asinine with my background and education.

4.0,Amazing people work for this company,"Apple is well known for having an amazing quality of work life and that is definitely true. Your team really does feel like a family and the benefits even for part timers is excellent. My only complain about the Reseller Specialist role is that depending on where you are, you will be alone for most of the time. I felt a bit disconnected from my other team members and only met my regional manager three times in person over the course of two years. There also wasn't a lot of room for growth in that role, I would either have to move out of state to seek another job with Apple or move to a different store that offered a similar role.",,,Apple Solutions Consultant,Former Employee,"Roanoke, VA","June 14, 2021"

You answer the same questions from 500 people a day who can’t afford anything but just wants to talk about products and play with them. The staff are also not very nice just a bunch of gossiping nasty people who makes up stories about each other to get you fired. Apple is more of a cult then a company and not in a good way at all",,,Sales Assistant,Former Employee,London,"June 6, 2021"
3.0,Energetic and engaging workplace full of empathetic coworkers but is extremely cult-like.,"I worked at Apple for a little over a year, it was the best retail job I’ve had by a long shot but the longer I was there, the more I drifted apart from the Apple mindset. At first it was amazing working for the worlds most valuable company, everyone is EXTREMELY passionate about Apple and it’s easy to be in the beginning. As time went on the magic of Apple began to fade and it was easy to see through a lot of the propaganda of how great the company was and how much they cared about the environment and employees. I seemed like the only one in the store who even thought about criticizing the company! Keeping my mouth shut, I continued my work, full time, and eligible for food stamps. Whenever I, or many others, tries to not only move up within the store but laterally, it was almost impossible, the bar is set extremely high. In order to move anywhere in Apple your goals must be met (service quotas, customer reviews, teamwork quota, etc), you have to be very outspoken and well connected in the store, and have to figure out exactly what specific answers they are looking for in the interviews, it takes three or four interviews to move within the store/company. However cult-like and high pressure Apple can be, without good pay, if you love Apple unconditionally and can easily get along with everyone you would enjoy the job. If you are able to move into management, even better, the management would drive into work in Mercedes, Tesla’s, etc, and were most likely not eligible for food stamps by any means.",,,Product Zone Specialist,Former Employee,"Manchester, NH","June 4, 2021"

Many employees have worked 60-hour weeks for several months straight during the pandemic with no comp days, bonuses, or reciprocation for their hard work. Pay is low and remains low -- year-over-year raises at most are 5% and that's if you work hard. Vacation and sick time accruals are low and not competitive. It is hard to get time off and if you do, the work piles up while you're gone. Apple products are so expensive and pay is so low that the discounts don't actually matter. Our health benefits were once nice but now no longer cover basic needs.",,,Workforce Management Analyst,Current Employee,United States,"June 3, 2021"
4.0,You will learn a lot,"Clearly the best thing about working for Apple was being able to learn about all new software be able to train customers on the software and services, as well as engage in that software myself for personal benefit and gains.

Many stores have Blackcards that they give their Store Leaders for business expenses, maybe now the Apple Card instead, but this kind of access to money, and influence goes straight to their heads.

1.0,If you care for your mental health stay away,"There is nothing I can’t really reflect here as they make you sign NDA’s (non disclosure agreements). But if you care for your mental well-being, look somewhere else, they behave like a cult.

They have events where they inflate their own ego, they do not appreciate people with degrees or studies ( maybe in the head office in the US perhaps, but at least not in the retail).

The worst is for Apple to treat their retail employees in a way that makes them feel tied to that company, I can’t say here because it will be censured as they obscure and hide ABSOLUTELY everything they do.

1.0,Terrible Experience,"I have worked at Apple before and it was great in tech support, customer service is a totally different job and you just get yelled at and are not able to get off a call unless they threaten your safety. Management or supervisors will not take calls if directly asked and therefore the statement ""I can have a supervisor call you back in 7 to 14 days"" is the only tool in your toolbox. The system is slow and if you are away for even one unscheduled minute to use the restroom in your own home you are penalized. Worse than all that is you cannot eat or do anything else because the phone doesnt ring and auto answers in your ear and you are not allowed to use a headset that lets you mute them so you can swallow or breath before answering.",,,Customer Service Representative,Former Employee,"Austin, TX","May 26, 2021"

2.0,A fairytale from another realm.,"Apple is a true fairytale. They make you believe from the outside looking in and even on the inside that you are in a fairytale. Indeed it is lovely.

Until the cracks start to show and you see them for who they are. The disorganization. The lack of strong communication or communication at all across departments. The lack of care for employees. The racism. The sexism. The true unfair treatment. You start to see everything and the fairytale becomes a true pure form of another realm.

It is slavery. I was enslaved to their time With my high intelligence. They use and abuse. It is not a fairytale. I highly recommend to not drink the coolaid. Apple is a literal form of a cult.",,,Specialist,Former Employee,"Washington DC & Houston, TX","May 21, 2021"

5.0,"Fun to work, without feeling too pressured","Working at Apple was the most fun I’ve ever had at a job. I say this with complete honesty, working Apple retail was the only job where I actively looked forward to going into work, and on my days off I would call in to see if they needed help or if they wanted me to come in early or stay late on days I was already scheduled.

Working at Apple retail was hectic for sure, but things were always under control. Leaders were on hand to make sure things were running smoothly, and that breaks and lunches were being given on time. Training was very thorough and on the sales floor knowledge was shared freely and employees were a team, not trying to outdo each other, but help each other if needed. At Apple the job was to sell the RIGHT product to the customer, not the most expensive one; if a customer was better off with an iPhone 8 instead of the newest model, they got an iPhone 8. Apple retail isn’t a commission based job so there’s no trying to push people to get $1500 phones. There are services and other things to mention and explain to customers but with sincerity as a motivator instead of greed. Like I said earlier, training was thorough, so employees were well informed of the products, unlike other jobs where they have to fake it. Everything about Apple retail was genuine and honest, just like how a store should be.

I was only a seasonal employee, but I would gladly go back in a heartbeat, and I’d even gladly do the lowest level tasks like changing the garbage cans and clean the bathroom that customers don’t even know is there.",,,Specialist,Former Employee,"Freehold, NJ","May 14, 2021"

4.0,Great work/life balance,"I'm pretty autonomous and get the chance to implement my ideas to streamline workflows and create documentation.

3.0,"Great products, fun job, very little to no opportunities to grow in AppleCare.","For an entry level job this would be great. For someone that has a higher education degree and is trying to make a career out of Apple, you will probably be there for 10 years before you get a management position in AppleCare unless you are all to play the corporate game that goes along with it.

Coming in as a AppleCare advisor you will move fast if you are good at your job. Which I was. I was promoted within a 8 months to a Sr. Advisor. I worked in two different orgs within the AppleCare. Once I became a T2 Creative Media advisor I was stuck in that role for 3 years before I decided to leave.

There was several things I had to learn on the go, but almost always it was held against me even though I was told it was normal to ""learn as you go."" I really enjoyed working for Apple overall.

I got along well with my co workers, but I wasn’t completely fond of the store manager. I didn’t always get the help I needed, nor the guidance. Unless you want to one day work at Apple HQ, you won’t be supported completely. Do I think Apple is doing their best to improve whatever issues come up? Yes.

4.0,"Can be rewarding, but does only feel like a stepping stone",During my time I made many friends that I consider close. The teams feels very much like family and many of them are life long friends. There is a ton of nepotism within select markets though. If you aren’t friends with the right people you won’t go far.

5.0,excellent work place and good company culture,"The training is well designed and their internal systems are mature so people can pick up the job easily and they have sufficient time to learn what they needed to know to complete their job at Apple. Meanwhile, it is hard to have input from the employee side as there is very limited space for you to change anything. It is good that the feedback is welcomed at Apple.

5.0,Best Job Ever,"I absolutely loved my 4 years at Apple, and only left due to relocating 2 hours away. Whilst it can get mega busy, the customers for the most part are lovely, and I really enjoyed getting to know them. I very quickly learnt that sometimes you end up as a therapist to customers, as we saw a lot of older people who liked to come in for a chat.

The team was great, although like anywhere, there will be some Clique behaviour. Management was great and always kept the mood and energy up. Apple employ people from all backgrounds and walks of life, which was great as I became friends with people who I wouldn’t of met otherwise.

The staff benefits/discounts are fantastic, and they also offer free private health care(aswell as many more).

5.0,Technical Specialist - Best job I've ever had,"Apple was one of the best job experiences I've had. Great management that cares about their employees health and work life balance. The employee breaks where extremely generous and very well paced making days fly by. Management for the most part had employees backs when positioning tough solutions to customers. Only on occasion did management end up bending to customers demands but often it was something as a technical specialist I was unable to offer anyway. All my employees were fantastic to work with. Helpful, happy and energetic. We had very little (if any) work place drama with about 150 employees in total. Goes to show the quality of people that are hired at my location. Only reason I left was no fulltime positions had opened in the time I was there (because no one wants to leave) and Apple's Conflict of Interest restrictions is honestly way too tight. As a creative person, you are limited in what you can do on the side because Apple has their hands in so many industries.",,,Technical Specialist,Former Employee,"Lancaster, PA","March 25, 2021"
4.0,Fun Job,The job was fun and has a lot of perks. Customers are great to interact with but can sometimes wear you down a lot (like any customer service/retail job). Team was very helpful and inclusive. Pay was great compared to similar role in other stores. Store can be busy a lot of the times,,,Product Specialist,Former Employee,"Atlanta, GA","March 23, 2021"
4.0,"Typical ""We're a Family"" Workplace but it's Apple","There are ""Daily Downloads"" which consist of talking about the service we sell (AppleCare) and why we need to change something to improve sales. It's all under the guise of self improvement and benefiting the customer. The managers and anyone that is a higher position than a ""Specialist"" (the sales people at Apple) are all drinking the Apple Kool-Aid and I always found it difficult to speak to them and them talk to you like a human, and not some robot reading some script. You were rarely told when something is good/going well but often given a talk when you mess something up or have 'bad' numbers.

Hey Apple, wanna know why most of us selling AppleCare don't care if the people get it or not? We're given no incentive to sell it other than to not get nagged or complained at by a manager. Overall, decent job. Pay and benefits were good, but the job itself was stressful. It's an hourly position and if you treat it as such and leave work at work, you should be just fine.",,,Specialist,Current Employee,"Columbus, OH","March 23, 2021"
3.0,It’s what you make it,"A lot has changed from when I started to when I left. The company really pushed you to learn as much as you can and self development when I first started. You were giving an hour a week to research products and services to help you better explain to customers, that practice now long gone. Everybody is now cross train across the store, you used to have specialist focused on selling products now they are somewhat expected to do some light troubleshooting and support the Genius Bar and vice versa for the technicians. It is somewhat hard to get promoted or even a lateral transfer, my advice is to focus on your numbers (sales/ratings/business connections). Managers will tell you not to and to focus on numbers and just focus on a good customer experience but when it comes down to promotions and raises they’re going to look at the numbers.

As far as retail job they offer a good compensation and benefits. And the people that work there are pretty cool.",,,Specialist,Former Employee,"Virginia Beach, VA","March 22, 2021"

3.0,"great company, terrible job","I absolutely love working for Apple. They have a great company culture, and most managers seem to really care about you as a person. Opportunities for continuing education are mostly on you, and since there are so many people that work with you, opportunity to grow is pretty scarce. While the company is awesome and I would stay with Apple forever if given the chance to work closer to my field, the actual tech support job is not fulfilling. It's nonstop phone calls of mostly angry customers, and hours of getting yelled at will eventually wear you down. Working remotely, your time is monitored very closely, and you don't get the reprieve or camaraderie of having coworkers around you. Company is great, position is draining.",,,iOS Advisor,Current Employee,"Cupertino, CA","March 20, 2021"
4.0,Contractor at Apple,"As a contractor, I felt like I was treated as less than a regular employee for sure. That made it easy to terminate my contract 3 months prior to it ending because of a different direction that the team decided to go in. That was unfortunate.

3.0,A great place to start.,"I feel like I gave a somewhat mixed review because my entire experience working for this awesome company really changed somewhere along the line. We were originally working to help our customers and somewhere it became all about metrics ""Customer was completely satisfied but did they buy AppleCare?""
This leads me to the culture which was typically good, but once there was an opening in your store, you were battling your friends for that position.
You do start with decent compensation compared to other retail stores, but that doesn't make up for the DAILY verbal abuse from people that don't understand that you have to follow certain protocols until a manager comes over and makes you look like a jerk.
Find a manager that cares that you can talk to. There usually is one (A lot of them pretend they do but only one TRULY does)
Last but not least, if you are worried about ""Not knowing enough"" they just want you to be a good person who knows how to talk to people they can teach you the rest later, and even when your unsure after training you always have all of your coworkers around to help you as well as a bunch of computers.",,,Specialist,Former Employee,"Lawrenceville, NJ","March 16, 2021"

3.0,Bad management on the French market,"- first there is no regulation on the French market (customer service) for people to know what steps to follow to progress in their career so that people who are just starting can also follow that path and not skip steps and get promoted for no reason.

-second there is a lot of favoritism and as some advisors because they’re close with the French management, they seem to process a lot faster than those who have been there for a while with great resuts in relation to the business, but just because they’re not close with the management they never seem to progress not even one bit.

In conclusion I was very disappointed by this as it’s hard to prove favoritism especially when the French management back each other so your end up been silent or leave.

I can’t speak for other contries management but I know that the Germain management is excellent they really reward their advisors on merit not favoritism.",On-site chefs for lunch,Can work long hours at launches,Customer Service Representative,Former Employee,"Hollyhill Industrial Estate, Cork, Ireland","March 15, 2021"

5.0,Apple cares,"I take calls from upset customers. It can get very stressful. We do have the benefits for therapist, which we get 15 free sessions per year and I use them every year, this should explain how stressful my calls are. If apple would rotate advisors between call and chat it would mentally help a lot of us. A lot of my peers are drained mentally. Management rotates a lot which could be good or bad you never know what you will end up with. My first team was amazing, my latest management I see no potential to grow under, and hence feel unsupported. I have one multiple awards under previous leadership. Under my current supervisor I feel unappreciated, misunderstood, and overlooked. Apple as a company I feel is great though. The support we received during covid 19 made me see that tremendously. Even our store employees were supported during store closures. Benefits are very expensive if you have a family and need a PPO plan. The discounts are decent.",,,AppleCare Technical advisor - remote,Current Employee,"Charlotte, NC","March 11, 2021"
3.0,An ok place to work until you have a breakdown,"My time at Apple (8.5 yrs) was a mix of being my best job ever to nearly killing me. When I started at Apple in AppleCare we handled one type of product. Some handled iOS products, some handled macOS products, some handled iTunes and on and on. 8 yrs later Apple has blended that support into one homogeneous mix. You are no longer an expert in one area, you are expected to be well versed in and support everything Apple releases. In addition to that , you’ll support every single country on the planet that Apple provides support to. This includes local and regional consumer law.
Apple outsources what seems to 80-90% of Apple care to other companies. Those companies are supposed to be held to the same impossibly high standards that Corporate AppleCare is. Sadly, they don’t seem to be. The transfers I got were the poorest quality customer support I’ve ever seen. There is definitely a hot potato mentality when it comes to dealing with either difficult problems or difficult customers. Get those things to someone else ASAP and let them deal with the poor customer survey.
AppleCare hierarchy seems to be so far from touching the customer that they have no concept as to what is actually going on with the customer base. What I mean by that is everyone who comes into AppleCare wants to get promoted to manager and above so that they’ll never have contact with an actual consumer. That contact ends with senior support advisors who are abused by customers, lower level advisors and team managers.

Everyone I worked with was amazing which led to an unparalleled adventure as a working experience.

Unfortunately management in the retail front is the main problem with this company. Managers separate themselves from the environment and put too much stress into the employees. Especially at the King St store in Charleston SC.

You are also required to treat the F.Y.I (for your improvement) book like it's the Bible. Managers do not help you to advance if they don't want you to.

2.0,Part-time seasonal specialist-short hills nj: know what youre getting yourself into.,"Long story short, it was a bad experience. I got all of the negatives of being as responsible for sales goals or AppleCare or apple card signings as a full-time specialists with none of the actual benefits of being a full time specialists in regards to health insurance and ability of having a more stable schedule.

There could have been a lot more done by the managers to integrate seasonal specialists into the team there. Its a stressful job even if you've worked there for years, but it can be even more stressful when you are new. That is not even adding in the quota of sales that the store wants you to achieve for AppleCare.

I didn't really like how emphasis was based on my quotas and not the actual customer experience. i felt forced to sell AppleCare even when i knew the customer didn't like it.

in addition, i knew that most of the group hired for seasonal work was not going to be chosen for full time positions because the store physically could not keep that many workers for the full year. however, it made me sick how the managers would pretend as if they were seriously considering most of us for full time positions.

Pros
Over time, you will discover different avenues to progress within Apple Retail. Stand out, work hard and make connections with management if you want to be pushed ahead. Helps to be extroverted. Great benefits which includes a stock plan!

Cons
As expected, retail life demands availability during weekends. Depending on the stage in your life, this may synchronize with your lifestyle (if you're young) or severely impact your social and family life. This becomes apparent as you begin the chapter in your life where your spouse and close friends all have weekends free and you're the odd man out.

Also, opportunities to progress in your career from Apple Retail to Apple Corporate is very limited but still possible.",,,AppleCare iOS Technician,Current Employee,Remote,"February 16, 2021"

2.0,Don’t work here as a contractor,"I worked in the Maps team as a data editor. It is a one year contractor position but they made it sound like an opportunity to get your foot in the door. It isn’t. Don’t fall for it.

The job is repetitive and requires no skill. Hours can be strange, you will need to work either Sat or Sunday. They train you pretty well so no need to worry. The contractors are generally all very nice and diverse, all eager to create a workplace bond that Apple does not encourage. Apple prefers to keep a strict divide between contractors and full time employees. You will feel it very acutely. You can eat at the cafeteria but you can’t use the gym. Don’t even think about attending regular happy hours. Full-timers generally are weary and aloof around contractors.

It’s a bit sad how people fell for the “foot in the door” tag line and found themselves in a job that often is way beneath their skillset. I’ve seen coworkers with phDs and master degrees who realized the trap they fell into after training ended. Team morale depends on your manager, some are very approachable while others are standoffish.

Upsides are cool contractor coworkers, decent pay in a nice office environment, ability to work from home during covid, and...that’s about it. Occasionally they will have free food in the parking lot that you can attend in your allotted break period. Oh they clock bathroom visits and breaks meticulously just to make sure you are not wasting their time. Nothing makes you more aware of your contractor status.

This job is suitable as a jumping off point if you want an entry level job in the tech sector,",,,Maps Editor,Former Employee,"Austin, TX","February 12, 2021"
4.0,"Great place to start, but don't stay too long.","A great place to work if you are in the retail world, as the pay and benefits are unmatched for the industry. Very open minded culture and liberal. It's easy to advance up a few levels, but forget about getting into management. Once you've made it to Pro, Genius, or Lead you should start looking else where for career advancement.

You get to work with lovely people, and customers who are typically on the more upscale and open minded side of things. At the end of the day it's still a retail job, and comes with all that is expected from that.

Management is almost exclusively hired from the outside, so there is a major disconnect from the workers and leadership. they push typical management agendas and force Apple lingo to a cult like state.

2.0,"Decent starting pay, horrible digital work environment","When I started at Apple almost 6 years ago, they had a great starting pay. However each and every increase thereafter was negligible to say the least. After about a year, I went from level 1 to level 2 technical support. The increase was not even $0.90. And that was my LARGEST increase to date. ""Level 2"" Technical support, at least in the chat space, are treated as rugs to be kicked and walked all over. And when concerns are brought up, we are told to send it as feedback, and nothing ever comes of it. We are given ever increasing responsibilities, with zero additional compensation. When asked about additional compensation, we are told we are, ""Paid competitively and have benefits"" so they will not increase them.

There are a few other big tech companies with privacy scandals (among other scandals), but you won't find that here.

Please note: Your experience at Apple is very dependent on the team you find yourself on. It is a very siloed environment. One team might all have kids and go straight home at 4pm.

They really make it a point to focus on resolving issues both for customers and employees to try to make Apple feel safe, motivating, and accepting during so much uncertainty in the world at the moment.

4.0,Good pay and understanding,"I worked as tech support and overall the pay and the benefits are wonderful. But the advancement is always really frustrating. They always tell you like “yeah after a year and you can get any position you want!” But every rotation they have or availability they only want managers and senior advisors that’s been with the company for over 3+ years.
It’s not worth the stress as much as I like to stay and move up but I keep getting overlooked or keep getting rejected by being told “you just don’t have the skills.” And won’t give me the training or trust to do so.",,,Customer Service,Current Employee,"Austin, TX","January 25, 2021"

Apple spends Millions on training their advisors to provide the top notch customer service that I actually apply to my everyday life. They want you to succeed!

3.0,Great place to start out,"Apple is a great place to work, however if you are a contract worker expect a clear divide. Somewhere around 60% of Apple's workforce is contracts, and if you are on a contract you are likely going to be paid much less than what is deserved for the work. Also depending on your department, there is very little possibility for conversion to an employee. If you are on contract, I would say use the resources available to get as much valuable experience as you can, and then find a company that will value you appropriately.",,,Analytics,Current Employee,"North Austin, TX","January 12, 2021"

5.0,"Lucrative and fun, at a huge cost...","The entire culture Apple has a company is super progressive, and at most times very empowering. Your pay is superb (even despite the fact you're not paid commission), and the training sets you up for success. Daily you're given a run down on anything new or what to expect from your location, so you're not shocked the moment you hit the sales floor. And the management for the most part is competent and understanding. However, with all these great points, there's one huge downside to all of this. There is absolutely 0 job security. Apple starts everyone out as seasonal new-hires, which makes sense with how hectic the holidays can be. However, regardless of your performance only 3-5 employees out of the 15-25 hired get to stay with the company after that contract expires. And it's never a good feeling to be the one left out of the party. Do I recommend working at Apple? 100%, just keep in mind you probably won't be there long unless you're more busy brown-nosing the managers than you are closing sales.",,,Specialist,Former Employee,"Denver, CO","January 9, 2021"

3.0,Apple retail,"Working at the Genius Bar can occasionally be very rewarding but after a while there really isn't anything new and every day kind of feel the same at some point. The people you work with is generally good as you see them everyday and you get to build that relationship but getting a promotion can be very difficult depending on the management (and your manager). I've been at Apple for 4 years and only have been promoted once and have been actively trying to get to the next role for quite some time, but am starting to not like the job as much anymore since there isn't an open position on the horizon and everyday really does feel the same.",,,Technical Expert,Current Employee,"New York, NY","December 31, 2020"
4.0,Depending on the type of management you get the job can be great. Hard to grow/little fish in a big pond,"It takes forever to get up in the company due to managers becoming managers and getting very comfortable (never leaving the position). I’ve had a laid back manager who was more geared towards my growth, and I’ve had an uptight manager that was critical of numbers, if you get a manager who will not be so critical of numbers, the job can be smooth and the path to grow can be compelling.",,,Home Team Manager Apprentice / Senior Advisor,Former Employee,Remote,"December 30, 2020"
5.0,Amazing culture and environment,I worked at Apple part time for two and a half years while I was going to school. They have an incredible training program that has helped me in my career greatly. They have an amazing culture and I have made lifelong friends with my coworkers.,,,Technical Specialist,Former Employee,"Houston, TX","December 30, 2020"
1.0,Busy high stress work environment where only the favourites are given opportunities,"After working for the company for nearly 10 years you would think it would mean something to your management team - it doesn’t.
They hide behind cleaver wording, “rewards” and cult like credo. As soon as you start to ask questions you’ll be socially cast out. Only those that drink the cool aid are rewarded. They’ll dangle job opportunities in front of you to get you to push extra services and get better results only to offer it to someone else.
The customers are rude and entitled and Apple lets them behave that way. They sell you this beautiful dream of working for this amazing company but all you will get is lies.

Don’t bother applying if you don’t fit the social norms for how a person should look. The fatphobia in that place is insane, you’ll never just be going to work and doing your job they’re always having some kind of “health” competition rewarding you for weight loss, working out or meal planning with blankets and water bottles.
Don’t expect to have accomodations made of you are or become disabled or chronically ill. I became disabled towards the end of my time with Apple, I had expected they would allow me to do light duties or to switch my position to one that wouldn’t cause me to be in constant pain and they didn’t. I had to go to HR and get a third party involved and it still wasn’t good enough.

Work life balance? Apples never heard of it. As a full time employee you are expected to be available 7 days a week 24 hours a day. You will be rostered 5-6 day shifts frequently, late nights and weekends. It’s almost impossible to get time off even if you apply months",,,Specialist,Former Employee,Fountain Gate VIC,"December 29, 2020"

Speaking of the benefits, there are so many of them. Maternity leave, fertility support, employee discounts, free software, vacation, sick.....You name it. I could see Apple is trying their best to improve their employee’s quality of life.

4.0,Good work environment with some issues,"I enjoyed working at Apple. The team I worked with was international and multi-lingual. I learned a lot from my coworkers. I really enjoyed the multinational aspect of the job.
One of the hardest parts of the job for me was the constant monitoring of our production. The job was somewhat routine, but trying not to fall below an acceptable level made the job both boring and stressful.
As a contractor, some of the privileges afforded regular employees were not available. This also meant I had 2 supervisors, one an Apple employee and one employed by the contract agency. This lead to some inconsistencies in management.",,,Apex Systems Contract Editor,Former Employee,"Austin, TX","December 17, 2020"

It was my first corporate job and I was there 4+ years and it has done wonders for my career. I worked with brilliant people, got to work on some amazing strategic initiatives that shaped the roadmap of the company. However, I had three of the worst managers you could ever possibly imagine. Two of them were terminated not long after I left. There was also a ton of backbiting by people I mistakenly called ""friends"".

4.0,Run of the mill UK retail managers let down the experience,"Several years ago, Apple retail was a great company to work for. Things changed in the UK as growth increased. Wages went down or stagnated, staff became disillusioned as the jobs became tougher.

Employee benefits seem great if you use many of them. Staff discount is not amazing and often can only used once or limited within a given time-frame. Often, staff will be expected to put in unpaid hours so as to hit targets that affect your annual salary increases (usually minimal). Some managers will block your career advancement if you don't go along with them.

The company (in the UK) seems that it's a great one to work for but is badly let down by managers who are the usual characters you will find at any UK retail store. More often than not, the managers are poorly paid and totally are driven by their own ambition. Many DO NOT care about the best interests of their staff and will move from store to store or rotate roles within a location.

It is hard work being in any customer facing role especially the service side (repairs and support). Staff turn over can be very high at certain times of the year which is ignored as there is no shortage of applicants willing to fill the roles. Getting employed is pot luck depending on location and position applied for. Usually it helps if you stand out in some way rather than what experience you have.

You may be lucky to work alongside some amazing people but more often than not you get the same experience as working for other UK retail companies. Staff routinely take sick leave or skive at some of the larger locations due to poor management,",,,Specialist,Former Employee,London,"December 1, 2020"

In the time I was there (6 months) I couldn’t book any holiday off not even one day that I wanted for my birthday. Other members of staff had somehow got 3 weeks off approved and one person 3 months?! They hired me on a 20 hour contract which they spread over 5 days, it was stated at the time of the interview that 20 hours would turn into full time. It did not.

3.0,"Great Experience, poor management.","Apple schedules weeks in advance which helps with planning personal time. Depending on if you are part-time or full-time, you would work 16-20 hours minimum for part-time, and 40 hours for full-time per week. You would work on the sales floor helping customer discover Apple products.

You can learn a lot about retail environment and how Apple puts itself at the top of the retail field when helping its customers. Unfortunately, the management at the Apple Store is not aligned with the corporate values of the company. They try to align with the culture that is brought forward by corporate, however the management did their own thing. Promotions were handed out based on favouritism and not merit. This was the hardest part of the job. Seeing people who were favourited by management get promotions instead of people who have worked diligently and followed the coaching provided by management but never considered for a promotion.

The most enjoyable part about the job is that you're able to meet amazing people in the job and build long lasting relationships with those specific people who have passions out of the store. I think this is the best aspect of working in an Apple Store. You're able to build your network with those people and of course it will help your professional career if staying with Apple is not in the cards.

Overall, the company itself is very good and they care for your well being, however the Apple Store management is extremely sub par.",,,Product Zone Specialist,Former Employee,"Toronto, ON","November 26, 2020"

4.0,Great place to work!,"Loved working at Apple, I learned so much and still use some of the things that I learned there in my current profession. There is an actual sense of community amongst team members here, or at least the store I worked at! I made friends and generally had fun. Apple is a great company to work for all around imo. Good work-life balance, great training, always opportunities to grow and learn, and overall a great environment.

The only thing I didn’t like were some of the customers & how we didn’t have much defense against verbal abuse and disrespectful behavior. It was always about turning the experience around, which worked with some people but not with others. I just don’t think consumers should be able to berate and mistreat employees. I feel like I have mild ptsd from this. But I suppose that is the culture that has been perpetrated throughout time to promote consumerism. There was not really much that could be done about it because Apple heavily relies on NPS scores.","Learned a lot, work life balance, decent pay, good management",Belligerent customers,Technical Expert,Former Employee,"Atlanta, GA","November 20, 2020"

5.0,Best Company to work for,"From day one, Apple instills passion on you and aim to develop you to success. I don’t mean that lightly, managers give you a 1/2/3/4 month expectation and it’s very clear to understand. They work with you to develop you and will do their best to accommodate to your success.

The team collaboration is really like no other company, people are incentivized by the yearly review to rate each other and provide direct feedback. It helps overall still better working environment.

WLB is pretty good as well, it goes in cycles, every group has them, during those busy cycles, you will work tirelessly, once we’re past those cycles things are very manageable and common for people to take lots of time off. You manage your own time.

Direction comes from top to bottom, this way focus can be set on what we should be doing now. Common to have open to direct communication with senior leadership.

Don't be surprised if UAT Team Lead expect to be online for 16-20 hours even when there is no work, else he threaten to escalate matter to higher manager and terminate from the company.

5.0,Great Place,"I worked as a specialist at Apple retail. The typical day would include a small meeting before each shift. We'll gather and talk about any new products or features and goals for the day. It's also a time to recognize your fellow employees for a job well done. Then it's off to the floor. You're assigned an area or you will start taking customers one by one. After a while, you'll get your two 15 minute breaks, then your one hour or 30-minute lunch (depending on how long your shift is). The customers aren't always pleasant and can be very demanding. A lot of them feel some false sense of entitlement because they shop there and expect you to break policy to fix their problem(s). If they start with you and have a bad interaction over something you have no control over, or if they were just having a bad day and then did a survey about their experience, it's going to be placed on you. A lot of times, the manager can see that it wasn't your fault, but there are times where you'll get pulled for something that was out of your control. I personally enjoyed myself there. It was only a temporary position, but I'd go back in a heartbeat.

I was promoted to manager, making more than enough to support my family, within 5 years. If you are willing to put in the time and effort, and are able to conform to your specific leadership team’s ideals for management, than you can prosper. As with any career, it comes down to what you are willing to sacrifice; retail hours, expectations from corporate for leadership being largely unrealistic, etc. It was an excellent place to begin my career sans education, and I would recommend it to others in a similar situation, but ultimately couldn’t compare to other opportunities that offer better balance and environment for similar reward.",,,Manager,Former Employee,Washington,"October 11, 2020"

Diversity and inclusion are important to Apple's culture and they make that very known with regular discussions.

The retail side however, is fairly easy because Apple provides the necessary tool to make the job flow simple. As someone who is on the tech side, I encounter many customers with many emotions. However, because of proper training depending on the issue it’s easy to work with a customer but if not you always have a manager to help out the situation. Benefits are phenomenal as well especially for me being a part time employee.",,,Technical Specialist,Current Employee,"Providence, RI","October 9, 2020"
3.0,Writing this to see other reviews,Again I am just writing this so I can see other reviews. I have to make up 150 characters this is such a dumb implementation by apple but what can you do,,,Reviewer,Former Employee,"Long Island, NY","October 9, 2020"

3.0,Decent,Decent place to work. Can be stressful with customers calling in having bad attitudes. Depends on if you have good supervisors & higher ups to help...,,,Customer Service Representative,Former Employee,Florida,"October 8, 2020"
3.0,It's a fun environment to an extent,"You can learn a lot from working here and gain great resume experience. Great managers, leaders, but you can easily get burned out with how scheduling is done here. Constant changing of schedules last minute without warning, non consecutive days off so it feels like you've been working non-stop, random hours start schedule. For someone who has things to take care and cant make the time for their crazy schedules they are good at giving you the time needed off but low-key despise it and may effect your long term goal with them if working towards that. People are great and will help you out but can come off a little competitive and fake especially if they feel like their job is threatened by you. It's very hard to advance( at this location at least) unless you are a super drone. Even if you really know your stuff and show it with performance. 95% of the people here are hired due to the fact that they've known each other for years outside of the workplace and are all good friends with management and people in higher positions at the store, It also seems these people are more liked and treated better as well as advanced to higher and better positions not only because they're knowledgeable and have superb performance, but only because everyone knows each other already.",,,Specialist,Former Employee,"Cerritos, CA","October 7, 2020"
4.0,Great place if you’re in the right role and willing to wait,"Apple is an amazing company to work for, but because of it’s size and prestigious reputation there is a lot of competition for advancement, even some of the most deserving candidates have had to wait years for management positions to open up. The role you come in as also has a lot to do with determining your career trajectory within the company. Aside from that it is an amazing place, with great people, wonderful culture, and benefits.",,,Technical Support,Former Employee,"Austin, TX","October 7, 2020"

4.0,It’s worth it but you have to drink the Koolaid at times,I enjoyed my time there and would go back but maybe to a different department. The advancement in my department was limited.

4.0,Drinking the Apple Juice,"Working here was not a bad job whatsoever but eventually you tire of the retail lifestyle and I saw it more as a passing job other than something id make my career.

4.0,It was ok,It was an ok experience. The staff was ok ans the managers were fine I guess. You can learn a lot actually.

1.0,Well paid but Apple aren't loyal to Anyone,The only Apple Systems Engineer/Education Accounts Manager in Western Australia.

Dumped after five highly productive years as soon as I had a temporary medical issue.,,,Engineering Manager/Education Accounts Manager for Western Australia,Former Employee,Sydney then Perth,"September 29, 2020"
5.0,They care about YOU,Management cares about YOU. They care about your goals and dreams both with the company and not. I have never felt more supported in a job. They also care about your work life balance and prioritize that for their employees. They went above and beyond to take care of their employees during Covid times too and always made me feel safe and taken care of. Every company should take notes from Apple.,,,Product Zone Specialist,Former Employee,"Murray, UT","September 28, 2020"

3.0,Great Place to work even though it has it's many headaches.,"The store I work at is very stressful and training is never clear and often looked over. However, giving feedback to managers seems to change things for a bit of time before things go back to the way they were. Overall, the pay is great and benefits are something to rival. Most peers are great to work with and I enjoy my time there with them. Development is taken seriously and the time is always given, especially when you ask for it.
When you're part time, the hours are very flexible. Full-time does not have that flexibility and work-life balance can be difficult. When scheduled, the week starts on Saturday and ends Friday. If you take a vacation, many employees express how they work 7 to sometimes 8 day stretches, but the company can get away with that due to the way the work week starts and ends. Then again, I'm not a schedule planner.",,,Genius,Current Employee,"Richmond, VA","September 25, 2020"
4.0,Great Place but Stress-full,I enjoy what I do and value the quality of work we do. It's a good feeling going home knowing that you made a difference in someone's life by making them the part they need to move forward.,,,Engineer,Current Employee,"Cupertino, CA","September 24, 2020"
2.0,Stressful environment,"Over worked, highly stressed environment. Colleagues are constantly seeking other positions within the company to find the 'greener grass' on the other side...and it doesn't exist. Lots of miserable folks, great talented long term employees leave earlier than retirement age due to burn out.",,,N/A,Former Employee,"Austin, TX","September 24, 2020"
4.0,It was great at first,Job pays good and has good benefits. Job was super great at first until they switched managers. Almost everyone there is willing to put you down to build their selves up. It just wasn’t fun towards the end of me working there. I would work there again but at a different store.,,,Technical Expert,Former Employee,"Reno, NV","September 24, 2020"
5.0,Good,Everything was so so good. The software engineering team was very helpful and I felt like I learned a lot. I would would definitely intern here again.,,,Intern,Former Employee,"Cupertino, CA","September 22, 2020"
1.0,Horrible,"No work/life balance at all! You will hate your own home after working this job, the shifts are ridiculous and you can only get one weekend day off. Right out of training you are thrown into 2nd shift, no if ands or burs. 1-9, 12-8, 1-10, there goes your entire day. 1 30 minute break and two 15s. You are given a PC and they have access to your camera and require weekly checkins to tell you how horrible you did or to talk about the 1 thing you did wrong all week and throw in 3 more changes to your job. This job sounds ideal, work from home chat... but they micromanage EVERYTHING YOU DO. They say they will not access your camera unless you're unresponsive yet if you put tape over it outside of your weekly meetings, they somehow know... every week they will monitor your screen at random times, you can be penalizef for asking t2 for help even if youve reached out without response. Its hard to get a day off even if you made the request 6 months in advance, they wont approve or deny it until the week of and most likely will deny it bc they rather you swap. This sucks if you planned a cruise or family reunion and get denied last minute. This job sucks, the TLs are annoying, theres a high turnover rate for a reason so you're always on a new team, theyre always changing protocol and expecting you to automatically get it the day of or else you get ridiculed during weekly meetings... the meetings are annoying",,,Chat Advisor,Former Employee,Remote,"September 21, 2020"

5.0,Best retail job ever!,"I love to work to his amazing company, everybody ar the store was a big family! Customers where always nice,whenever I needed help from my leaders they where always there for me. Friendly work space and the benefits are great! That makes you see how much the company cares about the employee.",,,Specialist,Former Employee,"Aventura, FL","September 15, 2020"
4.0,Inclusive Workspace,This is a great workspace very happy to work for a company that balances work/life. Apple tries its best to include feedback in a positive manner to make you a better YOU. It can be a great place to meet new people and get acquainted but you do have to be knowledgeable on the product. Depending on your store maybe management is great but in my experience they say they care but dont really show they tend to only help the people they like. Or sometimes even talk bad about their employees in the office its not thats the company and my experience was bad but the terrible management that thought they were better but tried to add a sense of community.,,,Specialist,Current Employee,"Los Angeles, CA","September 15, 2020"
4.0,Ok job for entry level tech type positions,I worked through a staffing agent. They were the ones who decided to terminate my employment because I could not find reliable childcare during the pandemic. I started literally at the beginning of the pandemic and it was doomed from the start. They give gift cards if you do well. They schedule you based on their business needs. They provide supplies also. Wasn’t so bad except at the end of the day they are a business and even though it’s global (Pandemic) they don’t have to consider your problems.,,,Technical Support Representative,Former Employee,"Houston, TX","September 15, 2020"
4.0,I think it’s a good company to work for,"Apple really does take care of their employees. The benefits here are really good and the pay is some of the best in retail. I will say for what most employees bring to the company I do think they should have a better starting pay. It’s hard to judge management as a company because every store is different but I had some managers that cared and others that didn’t. You can meet a lot of nice people and make some lifelong lasting friends. working with products you love and some that you’ve lived with throughout your whole life is pretty cool. overall this is a good job, BUT at the end of the day it’s still retail",,,Technical Specialist,Former Employee,"Novi, MI","September 14, 2020"
5.0,Productive workplace and difficult customers,"The overall experience was full of new information. It was a good experience to have ,the only problem were the customers.

1.0,It used to be good,It was fun then it took a nose dive constantly picking on people to get them to leave and the turn over rate in management is way to high. Not a career place for a retail job.,,,Mobile Device Tech,Former Employee,"Willow Grove, PA","September 14, 2020"
2.0,Apple Park should be repurposed as a public library and botanical garden.,"My job here was to rebuild internal dev tools, from scratch, that already existed. Presumably because there was some problem with the existing ones but I was rarely told what the problem was and it didn't matter because there was nobody to check if what I made was any better anyway.

But since nobody was really keeping track of me, and since my lanyard got me into any of the campuses, most days I just went out to the huge garden in the middle of the Apple Park campus and worked from wifi there. It was a pretty great gig.",,,Web UI/UX Engineer,Former Employee,"Sunnyvale, CA","September 14, 2020"

1.0,Don’t bother,It’s not worth the long workdays and low pay 9/10 they give you over time but expect for you to work them on your off days so you have no social/work balance,,,Customer Service Rep,Former Employee,"Las Vegas, NV","September 13, 2020"

1.0,The culture was great but overall not worth it,"I was impressed by how great the culture was at first; the campus has an amazing cafeteria with seemingly endless choices including a bakery, and the emphasis of ergonomics is top notch. However, I was hired to do a job with no upward mobility, in an open concept office with rude people who complained about my team talking, when we were encouraged to work together.

I was so stressed out all the time. Anytime I got sick I was in trouble with my boss and when a male coworker started rubbing my back in a way that was both inappropriate and made me feel uncomfortable I was too afraid to go to her so I just left and never went back.",,,Bilingual Content Analyst- Dutch,Former Employee,"Austin, TX","September 10, 2020"
5.0,I love the remote work but the technical side is iffy,"I love working with Apple. It’s easy and the training made it better for me to troubleshoot. It’s remote, which I love because it’s easy for me to wake up in the morning , drink my coffee, and get started with my day. I would say the downfall of the job is the technical side . If the systems are down or the internet drops I don’t get paid for the time I miss, which is understandable but very inconvenient.",,,Call Center Representative,Current Employee,"Raleigh, NC","September 10, 2020"
5.0,Fun family orientated workplace,Extremely busy but coworkers are generally great people who keep each other motivated and accountable. Management was clear and concise with messages to team.

Overall fantastic place to work for!,,,Home Technical Support Advisor,Former Employee,"Santee, CA","September 9, 2020"
4.0,Good place to work,"I've been working for Apple for 5 years. I generally enjoy the work. The downside is that schedules change every 4 months, so, when you get a one that doesn't work with your personal life, you are stuck with it for a long time.",,,Senior Technician,Current Employee,Work at home,"September 9, 2020"
2.0,Terrible onboarding process,The management on my team was horrible. Snotty and arrogant product managers. Their bosses were terrible too sticking their nose up at contrators. It was a 4 month contract of sinking NOT swimming. Horrible experience.,,,Jr. Product Manager,Former Employee,"Austin, TX","September 7, 2020"
4.0,A good career start,Right out the gate you are an Apple Employee! Benefits start as soon as you are hired. Management is always around to help. And you never know what perks may pop up,,,Home Advisor,Former Employee,"Memphis, TN","September 5, 2020"
5.0,"Great perks, hours, pay, and culture!","For the most part working as a specialist was a blast! There were some rainy days however, since ultimately it was still a retail job (some customers can be really mean for no reason!). The culture isn’t for everyone (some find it “fake”), but it’s very inclusive and welcoming place to work. The pay was good and the perks such as tuition reimbursement, employee stock purchase plans, insurance plans, and 401k match and much, much more were available to part time employees!

Leadership were usually rockstars who lead by example and were sensitive to the needs of their team, however there were definitely some that raised eyebrows (more exception than the norm from my personal experience). Also due to the culture, there seemed to be a large emphasis on interpersonal communication type competency when it came to decisions on lateral or upwards movement.

Really cool company values such as supporting individual privacy, human rights, and environments awareness.",,,Specialist,Former Employee,"Gilbert, AZ","September 5, 2020"

5.0,Amazing company to work for!,"Working for Apple was one of the best jobs I have ever had. They treat their employees with respect and truly appreciate them as much as they appreciate their customers. Everyone acts like a big family and are always there for one another. I would recommend Apple as an employer to all of my friends and family. Their benefits are great, their pay is very competitive and their management is always there cheering you on. The only “con” would be that they follow retail scheduling. So your shifts vary every week and there is not much consistency.",,,Product Zone Specialist,Former Employee,"Woodmere, OH","September 2, 2020"
2.0,Apple's illusion of inclusion and diversity,Apple will hold beer bashes and events to give the illusion of inclusion and diversity.

5.0,Amazing Company to work for,"Apple is a company with extremely high standards and always expects the best from you. Working here so far I have grown as a person, developed many key skills required for future job roles, and have become a better individual overall. The teams you will work with ranging from standard associates to management are always supportive and willing to help you achieve your personal goals.

2.0,Technical Expert,"● Work-life balance
If you’re part-time, they don’t care when how if you come to work. There is really no work-life balance for someone with a family. It’s retail. And the recent shift in store manager has left the employees worried as they were told “be prepared to be micro managed” and “why are you in school if you have a job at apple?” This store manager also got the previous store manager fired solely so they could take their job. It was a great place to work under previous leadership. Current store manager does not follow Apple’s credo, or even believe in it. Fake, manipulative, and ONLY for themselves and what makes them look successful. A shark in a pool of scared children.

● Pay & benefits
Pay is good, benefits are as well but you will pay for them.

● Job security and advancement
Career growth was pushed on the opinions of the store manager. If you were under this managers team, you got promoted. If they didn’t like you, no matter your skills set, you stayed where you were and watched the lesser individuals around you work their way up.

● Management
Management is a joke. It all went downhill when they promoted their store manager from within the store. Conniving, untrustworthy individual that only cares for themself and their career advancement. Does NOT care about their employees unless it benefits them.

● Culture
The culture is wonderful if you can find a location that actually believes in it. The manager at Germantown is a everything that Apple wants on the outside, but is the exact opposite inside. Selfish, prejudiced, very surface. Doesn’t understand the issues",,,Technical Expert,Former Employee,"Germantown, TN","August 28, 2020"
4.0,Great culture and awesome benefits,"Working with Apple I gained tons of experience where previously I had almost none. It broadened my skill set more all while working with amazing people. I got work with with people from all walks of life who were willing to build each other up.

3.0,"Competitive, Can feel like High School, Not as great as its called out to be.","It’s a super competitive job! If you don’t keep your numbers up while hired you will get laid-off. Co-Workers can be cliquey. As a new employee, help is always available, even though your encouraged to ask questions.

5.0,AppleCare AHA Experience Based on Management,"I’ve been at Apple for over two years. The pay & benefits are great. But just like any other company, working in customer service is tough because of the customers, and sadly, sometimes even the managers. I started with Apple At Home in the College Program (more lenient and they work with your school schedule) and since I graduated I was moved up to part time pro at home advisor. I’ve had multiple managers and only one has been a bad experience. Luckily, I have had two other great managers before her but honestly your experience at Apple will suck if you’re under the wrong manager. Thankfully I have been changed and I again love my job and am motivated to reach my goals.",,,Mac+ Advisor,Current Employee,AHA,"July 11, 2020"
5.0,Overall best place to work even as a non-central employee,"As a typical employee (technical support/AppleCare), Apple took care of us with great benefit and fair pay. It's noted in the ""Cons"", but to further elaborate.. management always say customers first and that the metrics are just for general performance measurement. However, they often bring up the metrics in performance reviews and even started sending out spreadsheet to show how you stand out with the other team members. Granted, you were given a code identifier so that only you know who you are in the list, it's still a passive aggressive way to say you don't stack up. It makes you feel less appreciated, and that's with me always being top 5 in performance each month. Another thing they started doing near the end of my stay there was providing scripts. Management said it ""wasn't"", but if you're telling me what I need to say at the beginning and end of call, then it's definitely a script. I've had few management changes throughout my employment, so I can't say I had the same negative experience with my other team manager, but the last one was the only one I went through those changes.",,,Apple Care Technical Support,Former Employee,At-Home,"July 10, 2020"
4.0,Ok place,Overall its not a bad place. Its just very hard to move anywhere. They constantly tell you one thing and do another. Not to mention the sudden turn around in culture. If you dont mind be a pushy salesman its not too bad. Otherwise its turning into bestbuy 2.0,,,Product Zone Specialist,Current Employee,"Novi, MI","July 10, 2020"
5.0,"High Stress, But A Great Community","Sales can be very stressful, since the Apple Store sees such a high volume of customers. However, the job itself is fun, because you get to learn and explain cool things, and you also don't have to upsell, which I loathe as a concept. The workplace community is absolutely a family, and you're well supported by the company (great benefits and fair pay), your managers (feedback goes both ways), and your coworkers (everybody has everybody else's back)
Overall, it's a great place to work even with the sometimes stressful pace.",,,Product Specialist,Former Employee,"Natick, MA","July 9, 2020"
5.0,Amazing culture who supports individualism,I was able to learn a lot from my colleagues and was pushed to do my best both in the store and outside. Events happened frequently and were optional.

By the nature of the work - sales - the job was highly competitive, but there was plenty of support to help everyone achieve their goals",,,SMB Business Manager for Apple - Consultative Solutions Sales,Former Employee,"Denver, CO","July 7, 2020"
4.0,Fun workplace but horrible pay,Working part-time at Apple was a good experience. Typically they work you anywhere from 20-30 hours a week. Most everyone starts out as part-time unless you are in management and in order to get hired in as management you need district manager experience at a big box location. They promise you advancement opportunities which can be achieved however the pay is the most disappointing thing about the company for as much money as Apple makes. They do offer benefits to part-time employees which is a plus. I would recommend working their part-time but I could never work there full time unless I was a manager because of the pay.,,,Product Specialist,Former Employee,"Columbus, OH","July 7, 2020"

4.0,Great opportunity to learn sales and something about yourself,"Awesome job with personal rewards. Helping family, business employees, teachers and students find the right technology for their needs. Your promotions depend on your managers (especially People Manager), and their is turnover. They will promote the ones they like. But great opportunities to learn, to travel and great benefits. If you get a bad manager, they can ruin your career.",,,Technical Specialist,Former Employee,"Charlotte, NC","July 5, 2020"
3.0,Used to be an amazing place to work now not so much,"Apple used to be one of the most sought after places to work. Now they’ll hire any moron who can smile and same hello. As long as you’re pushing Apple Services like iCloud and Apple Card and AppleCare and getting business intros you’re good but the day you slow down you’re terrible

Don’t even attempt promotion if you’re over the age of 30 and/or have a family since you can’t then fully commit 150% of ur life to them.

I used to be proud to say I worked for Apple now with all the changes we are just another retail store

Some older stores still live the Apple culture they way it was intended to be",,,Sales,Former Employee,Connecticut,"July 4, 2020"
2.0,No Value for Tenured Employees,"If you are looking for a company that will value you as time goes by, look somewhere else.

They pushed most people out of the company who weren’t in management who had been there as long as I had.",,,Allocation Specialist,Former Employee,"Austin, TX","July 3, 2020"

2.0,Eh,It’s difficult to move up.

2.0,Quite hard to meet expectations,"Working for Apple has been great so far, what I always hated about the job, was all of the unfair surveys I got, in the chat queue, there was always some instance where the system would link a case to you (a business chat which was multi advisor) and even if you replied only: ""Bye, take care"" and the chat ended there, the system would link the survey to you whether you handled it completely or not, just because you were the last one to handle it, and this really affected my personal metrics which I hardly would reach and also my view on the company, and always managers only on the customer's side even if you did great.
It really was a pain. Stress was always there and the training to be honest was terrible.
We were thrown into Nesting not knowing anything at all about the product and the worst part was that those months' metrics were already being counted and all our training team did terrible.
It's been 7 months working for them, and I am still learning, and always complaining about the survey system.",,,iOS Advisor,Current Employee,Undisclosed,"June 16, 2020"
5.0,Great company,I love how the job pays weekly and it’s $14. Great for paying benefits when you can’t work. Do your best to get hired through Apple and not the Volt temp agency.,,,Technical Support Advisor,Former Employee,"Elk Grove, CA","June 15, 2020"

5.0,Second best Job I ever had,Work was fun. Not difficult at all. Frankly it was entry level work. The problem happens because ID dictates work so all you do is make a lot of design changes. There is no challenge in the work. It is just keeping up with constant changes.,,,Senior Firmware Engineer,Current Employee,"Cupertino, CA","June 13, 2020"
1.0,How they treat their residents,"I enjoyed working at Apple Rehab. At the same time I feel like they are unfair to their employees and to the residents. And that management should work together better do you make sure they're stuffed well.

5.0,"Great culture, fast paced!","I had a fantastic time working for apple. I learned a lot about how to give and receive feedback, and a lot about empathy/sympathy. Working on the Genius Bar taught me about time management and setting expectations among many other interpersonal skills. Management for the largest part is very supportive and willing to help you progress. Everyone gets along in teams, and is willing to help one another out. The people are the best part of Apple.",,,Technical Specialist,Former Employee,"Reading, Berkshire","June 11, 2020"
1.0,Poor management,Managers have their favorites. They will prioritize people who suck up to the management then people who are genuine hard working. I was on a temporary contract and worked very hard during the Christmas time. I was on top relating to the sales and service but when giving the permanent contract i was ignored with few other hard working people. People who got the job was someone who would always sweet talk to the managers or had a relative already working there. Very very sad experience with management in trafford center.,,,Product Specialist,Former Employee,"Trafford Centre, Greater Manchester","June 11, 2020"

3.0,Special Treatment and double standards,"I worked at the apple store in Hamburg Jungfernstieg, Germany.
As technical specialist I handled warranty services and repair services.
My performance was alright to good but I got fired nevertheless.
In 6 Months I made one mistake that I have been aware of but the management stopped talking to me until they fired me on my last day of probation. Fortunately I made good friends with Co workers, they are not to blame for the management and their sometimes bizarre statements or visions.

4.0,Multi racial and productive workplace,"I have gained valuable experience during my time in Apple. My seniors, managers and trainers were approachable and willing to guide us. The satisfaction from the happy customer review was part of the motivation of the job. My manager even share with us his best practices. The downside is probably the dissatisfied customer survey which was included as part of your performance even when the feedback isn't about you.",,,Technical Support Advisor,Former Employee,Ang Mo Kio,"June 6, 2020"
4.0,One of the Best!,"This is by far one of the most fun and engaging companies i have worked with. The new models they introduce ahead of time, and software updates.

Two thumbs up!",,,QA Specialist/Tech Support,Former Employee,"Atlanta, GA","June 6, 2020"
5.0,Amazing team and incredible working environment.,"Working at Apple was by far one of my favorite jobs to ever work. As someone who was familiar with Apple products but not completely into technology, I found the training to be very fun and educational. Teamwork is encouraged, especially when it comes to handling tougher customers so you will no doubt build great relationships with co-workers in a short amount of time.",,,Seasonal Specialist,Former Employee,"Toronto, ON","June 6, 2020"
3.0,"Good work, High Volume Call Center","If you enjoy a call center environment it is great. Little troubleshooting knowledge is actually needed, customer service skills will take you far.

4.0,Great for college students but zero flexibility in schedule.,"I have been at Apple as a part time field sales specialist for three years. Apple puts their people first and always takes care of the customer, which makes going to work great. Being in a part time role, I have worked Friday through Sunday from open to close basically for three years. While it was what needed to be done for me to finish my college education, it has been personally very taxing on my mental health. There is no flexibility in the schedule whatsoever for part timers in this channel of Apple. I know the actual Apple stores are a little different because employees have the ability to swap a shift with someone and they have a larger staff but in this channel it's just me covering my location. If I need a day off or I am sick my store is left without coverage so the flexibility does not exist. There is no room for promotion, which is often the case at Apple retail as well. My spouse has worked as a supervisor for Applecare at home for about six years and it's the same thing with that channel as well. The benefits are above average. I think pay is a little above normal, enough to make staying worthwhile until you find the right fit if you're ready to leave, but medical/dental/vision, etc. are good. Apple offers a variety of discounts on products & services to employees, as well as ways to give back through employee matching programs. Apple has a huge inclusivity stance. Politically, I would say most people, including leadership, fall left so for the few people who fall more conservative whether it be social issues, system issues, etc. at this time they are very alienated.",,,Solutions Specialist,Current Employee,"Strongsville, OH","June 3, 2020"

4.0,Not consistent across teams,"I have worked for some real tyrants that made my life really difficult and prompted a mental breakdown and medical leave. I am currently working for an amazing and supportive boss now.

5.0,Demanding but very rewarding,"You'll start the day on calls that could be a stretch of 30mins-3hrs. Varying breaks and other time off during the day makes it fair. Time management and self discipline are extremely important in this job.

Going into the role of technical support I already had a great interest in technology and a desire to help others. It's this common interest in both areas that makes the job much less stressful and complex than it might otherwise be. The combination of initial training, ongoing training, and the push to perform just makes you feel like Apple wants you to be the best you possibly could be without going over the edge.

It's not a job for everyone and you need to be in the right headspace to excel. The job was fairly tricky for the first few months but was quick to get to grips with. Experiencing both late and early shifts I would say it's somewhat easy to adapt to but this is very much on an individual basis. It will or won't work for you. No review can answer how you will adjust, that's up to you to discover.

In addition to the daily work you reap the benefits of working for the best technology company on the planet. Health & dental insurance, pension plan, stock options, and discounts across a range of products.

After my first year at Apple I really felt like I made the right move; thinking that I've become a better person because of where I work and what I do. Going on 5+ years in the job this still rings true with me.",,,Senior Technical Support,Current Employee,Waterford,"May 30, 2020"

5.0,Caring and Friendly Environment,"I would work a few different times a week and any hours in a row. I learned a lot about how to treat a customer. I have already had many years of experience with Apple devices and with a passion for helping others. The management was very helpful in finding different ways for me to succeed in the customer experience and myself improving within the company. Every coworker I had was extremely helpful and supportive of one another. I learned a lot during that job and so did they so if either one of us had a question we could ask one another. The hardest part of the job was definitely finding different solutions to each customers' problems. I worked my hardest with each different customer to find the solution because that is the reason they came into the store.

5.0,Working at Apple,"I loved working for Apple. By far, one of the best jobs I’ve ever had. The workers are so understanding and actually care about each employee. I was able to really create a relationship between myself and my customer, something a lot of fast-paced environments don’t allow. I’m a very person-oriented worker, so I loved that. On the other hand, due to the long hours and slow pace, I did get tired and I wasn’t able to really stay at the job due to the fact that school was my first priority and they couldn’t really understand that or allow me to cut down on my hours.

3.0,Great company but poor local leadership,"Apple as a company is amazing. Unfortunately, I worked for nearly 8 months and was unable to go from part-time to full-time. The schedule was very difficult to manage as I had to work another part-time job. Apple was not accommodating at all in working with my other schedule. This was the most frustrating thing about Apple. They wouldn't promote me to full-time, even though my stats and attitude were well above average, yet expected me to make them my priority for scheduling.

The leadership at West County is poor. Some of the managers were absolutely amazing while others, mine especially, were more interested in a popularity contest rather than work output and customer experience.
