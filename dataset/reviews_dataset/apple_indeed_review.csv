I miss the culture, I miss the way they approached providing service and care in person differently than last phone places I had worked. And developed my skills from sales into realizing I was an untapped technical mentor. And continued building me in those strengths until I had to leave due to work live balance requiring me home in the evenings onward.

I would describe the experience like a behaviour modification exercise. The whole environment is seemingly , favoured toward extroversion.

4.0,It’s apple,"Senior Customer Services Representative (Former Employee) - Arizona - March 3, 2023",Self explanatory but I think it’s a great opportunity for people to learn how the world operates and what it means to be able to help a person who has issues and that the main goal is to make sure that everyone is happy and helped out entirely and not be overwhelmed with rushing things and things get frustrating for everyone in the working class because it’s life.

One nice thing is that we don't really have to deal with the angry customers, the leads and managers will. I think the main issue with management is an obsession with store statistics - there's constant hassling about different products or services - other team members agree and say that almost all of our management is toxic. The most enjoyable part of the job was how friendly and willing to help most team members are - asking questions and helping each other out is common. Great benefits and discounts!",Potlucks and free lunches on some occasions - like Black Friday.,"""toxic"" management"

Very lenient place to work which respects your life outside of work. Very difficult to get fired unless you really mess up.

The only real deterrent is management. They are essentially tenured and managers tend to form cliques. Because of this, it's sometimes hard to get promoted/apply to different in-house positions since they reserve it for their favorite subordinates.

5.0,Excellent job,"Customer Sales Specialist (Former Employee) - Grand Rapids, MI - February 18, 2023","If you are looking at a position at apple and the position looks like something you would enjoy, I would definitely recommend giving apple a try. They really focus on the employees in a way the many companies do not. Managers seem to really care about the employees as people and not just employees. Very communicative with changes happening in the store. Benefits are really good, and the pay is very good comparing to many other companies.

3.0,It's still a major corporation,"Operations Specialist (Current Employee) - Chicago, IL - February 9, 2023","Apple's a pretty easy job overall. There are options if you want to get involved outside of your regular day to day duties. The culture definitely varies store to store but it's a pretty welcoming environment. It's still retail though and it gets very draining. Work life balance isn't always the best because of the way shifts are set up and we absolutely aren't paid enough compared to how much the company makes. Management could be better and they tend to not like to take some customer concerns.

3.0,Retail is retail.,"Specialist (Former Employee) - Glendale, CA - January 17, 2023","Retail, for everybody, is probably the worst kinda job out there. Working at Apple Retail is the best of the worst.

Pros:
• good pay compared to other retailers.
• coworkers got your back, and the managers, for the most part, are very supportive when it comes to customer-facing conflicts.
• benefits are crazy, discounts on Apple products are the best employee-discounts I've seen.

cons:
• if you want a promotion, or want to be noticed, you have to meet a quota, just like retail. you have to make sure you're selling iphones with applecare. that's all they care about. they WILL NOT keep you if you do not meet these standards, otherwise you're just another seasonal to them. I left because of this.
• you will meet the most obnoxious, self-righteous, and snobby customers in your life when you work there. because of this, it's probably one of the most stressful retail jobs because you're working for a big company and customers' products and data are very sensitive.
• absolutely no WLB. as a temporary/seasonal employee, you have to work on the weekends, plus any two weekdays. it's usually always slammed, and as a seasonal you'll be thrown the worst shifts (1-10p, 2-11p). If you have school, do not try to work here. My store manager forced my coworker to choose either school or work.
• coworkers can be great, but some will not want to be your friend at all. they want the promotion as bad as everybody else, so it can result in a toxic work environment.",,

What is the work environment and culture like at the company?
It’s great if you work at the main campus. If you are in retail or AppleCare, you are nothing more than meat. Just a butt in a seat. Mgmt has zero respect for front-line hourly employees.

5.0,Good,"At Home Advisor (Former Employee) - Michigan - January 11, 2023","Apple's benefits are unmatched.

The call-off and leave time policies and procedures are quick and easy.
Managers rarely reached out when I called in, and that made me feel like it was okay to have a life outside of my desk.
With AAPL being such a large international company, the room for growth is there, but don't expect to immediately get an executive level promotion.

The call-off and leave time policies and procedures are quick and easy.
Managers rarely reached out when I called in, and that made me feel like it was okay to have a life outside of my desk.
With AAPL being such a large international company, the room for growth is there, but don't expect to immediately get an executive level promotion.

That kind of work can be stressful for some people as you're usually dealing with angry customers.

Apple provided great scheduling options with 5x8 and 4x10 schedules. They worked with your class schedule, had great pay, and probably the best benefits of any job i've heard of.

The good is that you can meet a lot of people either customers and your fun-loving talented co-workers. Creative and high level of innovation are true to Apple's company culture. In addition, the company always try to make a positive impact everything she touches. I worked for Apple for 10+ years and have been rooted in those values. I left Apple for 5 years now because Apple has lost my love and trust. Promotion in the company was hard, but I had a few throughout my career. Favoritism with managers played a stronger role in your promotion than your ability. Because I worked for Apple for so long, I witnessed the quality of managers declined significantly.

There were no incentives and no commission, despite me personally selling millions of pounds worth of Apple products per year.

Pay rises were minimal (less than £500 per annum) and progression was blocked by certain managers. I was personally told that I wasn't ""Appley enough"" for a promotion. At the time, I was top in sales and customer satisfaction. Every manager signed off on me applying for the promotion. Customers would ask to see me and bring me gifts as a thank you for my honesty and assistance.

Managers would force you to share gifts with everyone else. I always thought that was a little bit odd. I can't share a cupcake with everyone! Haha.",,

So far I have worked in two different locations (one in NYC the other out of state). Your experience will vary depending on your market. At my previous location out market leader made everything as transactional as possible and metrics were of the upmost importance. If you were not selling X, Y, and Z then you were not doing a good job. To clarify, Apple employees DO NOT work on commission. It is an hourly pay job! With that said, depending on your reviews (customers can give you reviews in their email receipts) and your metrics that does play into your compensation. So it’s not commission based but you really want to hit all of their marks to insure that you can have the best pay boost possible. My current location in NYC is better in terms of culture and what the market leader wants. It’s very easy going though the pay could definitely be higher for NYC cost of living (honestly the biggest strike I have for this location). Give it a shot! Something to try out.",,

4.0,"Apple Ireland great place to start l, not to progress","Senior specialist (Current Employee) - Cork, County Cork - November 4, 2022","I started in Apple Care 4-5 years. Apple is a great company to start with, they pay well, you have great benefits and they train you to support a lot of products.

You have to work very hard to progress out from AppleCare into corporate due to the massive number of candidates fighting for limited corporate/ offline positions.

Major cons:
-Company’s unwillingness to embrace remote work
-Little progression options past senior technical specialist positions in Apple Care",,

5.0,"Great Company , great benefits, Great culture and diversity , Heavy Metrics based, High Call Volume","iOS MAC + Advisor (Remote) (Former Employee) - Remote - November 4, 2022","Apple culture is unique and very diverse. Most managers are pretty laid back but still focused on goals in a good way. Call volume is very high w/ back to back calls every 7 secs w/ rare occasions of larger breaks in between. High technical job w/ alot of multi tasking and they are heavy on metrics. Very good on work accommodations if needed and coworkers are very caring. Nice charity donation matching, great tuition assistance , 401 K, super amazing insurance rates and coverage, PTO, sick time, etc. Great learning environment with all the tools you need to learn available to you. Opportunity to advance and grow as you move along from T1 to T2 etc. Great coworkers who help you grow and great managers w/ the exception of my last manager. Under her leadership 3 of us quit including myself but my other 3 managers before her were beyond amazing. Alot of room for growth and pay is very good but sometimes feel its too little with all the brain power thats needed to troubleshoot Apple devices especially on complicated calls. Some calls are super easy versus others but you never know what kind of call you will get. Some calls are super difficult and customers can get pretty upset when their apple devices do not work. Overall its a call center type job so alot of this stuff is expected but overall I will say it was an amazing experience and outstanding company to work for.. by far the best one I ever been apart of in my opinion.",,

Office structure is very rigid with WFH rules - especially since covid.. Agile way of working which is great. Tools could be better, we don't use salesfore or many saas which could seriously be useful sometimes (a bit old school). Way too many men in managerial positions it's not looking good frankly for women. High hierarchy style company, don't expect a fun and start up culture > most people are in their 40's and busy.

Culture could be better, cheap on team gatherings and fun moments, no events, not many celebrations, no budget for farewells. It's ok to not finance everything but make an effort to build more CARE in the company.",,

4.0,No advancement,"Social Response Advisor (Former Employee) - Remote - November 1, 2022","In the remote field working for Apple, it's almost impossible to advance. You can switch around between departments but advancing is very slim. There's almost no room to grow. In 7 years, I've had more than 7 managers. I've had managers just hired that didn't really know about a department, managers that were amazing and supportive and managers that were just careless. They have great benefits and the pay is fare but raises are almost nothing so after a few years you don't really see a difference in pay. Schedules are picked by bids which are based on performance. However, even with great performance you can be stuck with a bad shift. Not much of a work life balance depending on your schedule and time zone. Personal discount is also good.",,

Les managers sont des flics (ils sont certainement poussés à l être) et certains infantilisent les employés. ils aiment bien les employés qui viennent rapporter certains comportements d’autres employés … pour evoluer il faut être dans les petits papiers. il y a beaucoup d’absentéisme du a des plannings costauds. certains n ont pas 2 jours d’affilée de congés par semaine. Beaucoup restent pour les « avantages » financiers.

3.0,Overrated,"Mac/Mobile Technical Support (Former Employee) - Mississauga, ON - October 25, 2022","I think that Apple actually does a good job making you think that you belong to this company but for the most part everything is an ends to the means for them. I would often while working at Apple be apart of coaching which was done not because their was anything wrong but more so just so someone could say that they were giving feedback to advance their career. I found at times there was no balance between what needs to be done and what should actually be done. For example, if there was no opportunities for feedback managers would often just find reasons just to give you feedback which often just came across as micromanaging. If you are ever on the wrong side of management best believe there are going to weaponize procedures to make your life unpleasant. There are good parts like the discounts and meeting amazing people but its not the dream they sold you. Have very clear intentions of where you want to go while being there.",,

The benefits are amazing, the work is fun, the people are great, the customers are eh, and the management is TERRIBLE.

Apple now mostly hires vendors who are underpaid and undertrained. You never know whom you will speak to when you call. Customers can be abusive and downright mean. Apple takes away any segment that is not customer-facing. Requirements are getting stiffer as well. Management is outside hires who have never taken a call and lack understanding of the role.

2.0,Company values changed disconnect from management.,"Creative Pro (Former Employee) - Glendale, AZ - October 10, 2022","Company was great in early-mid 2010’s. Policy changed to discourage repairs and only new phone sales. Buying phones outright to avoid upgrade charges from the carrier also banished. Our older clientele were left high and dry when learning sessions were discontinued. At every role you’re responsible for providing feedback to coach other employees, even laterally, this creates a huge disconnect with management since a majority of the responsibility falls now on to yourself and your peers. Due to this, management is rarely around and mostly in the back watching videos. This also creates a problem for advancement. Your told to “journal” about your achievement and growth, you can make up stories and situations that can push your towards a promotion. This leads to employees being in roles they are not properly trained for. Pay is very low compared to the profit made for the company. Even an entry level sales person can sell hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of product but will receive no commission. Instead, you’re told that you’re “doing your life’s best work”. Great job if you’re younger looking for a fast paced environment. Be prepared to apologize for everything. Queues are very long and the store doesn’t have any signage so you’re “the sign” as well.

It’s starts off fine but after being there for a year or two you start to see the reality. The retail employees are basically the underdogs, and all of the glorified benefits that you get told about are mostly received by corporate individuals. The compensation and benefits are nice retail level too but the work life balance is absolutely horrible. The job itself is also very stressful, draining, and mentally demanding so I never have a social battery when I leave this place. You are bombarded by customers back to back and you really don’t get a break in between because they are concerned with their “numbers” so it’s very exhausting. The other side they don’t mention to you is the number of people who take their own lives or really struggle with mental health from being here so much. I have been here a while and seen people leave and go start new jobs and they seem much more happy. Don’t sacrifice your mental health for the extra dollar an hour.",,

1.0,Apple hates helping their employees.,"Product Specialist (Former Employee) - Oak Brook, IL - October 4, 2022",If you're someone who struggles with mental health do not work for Apple. They preach inclusivity and acceptance of others; but once you get in management will belittle you at the first sign of weakness and they'll do whatever they can to push you out rather than help you improve your standing in life,,
3.0,Very Stressful Job,"Tier 1 IOS and Mac+ Advisor (Former Employee) - AHA - October 4, 2022","Pay was decent however it is a very stressful job and hard on your mental. Taking calls all day, listening to incompetent, entitled customers, was difficult. Often dreaded going to work.",,
3.0,Not what it used to be,"Specialist (Former Employee) - Toronto, ON - October 4, 2022","First, and most importantly, Apple does a great job of hiring non-management employees. Some of the best people I've ever worked with.

However...

Apple used to be a far better place to work than it is now. The pay, while admittedly better than most retail jobs, is not commensurate with how much money retail employees bring in for the company, nor for what you have to put up with from the post-pandemic retail customers.

Management is slow to act on issues the employees bring up, if at all. They will set up ""town hall"" meetings for people to raise issues, and then blatantly shoot down concerns that are raised. But there is also a culture of intimidation somewhat from the management, so no one really wants to raise issue in the first place.

For the past couple years raises have been less than inflation, so you're actually making less money now than in 2019, despite what your hourly rate shows.

The culture used to be to serve the customer's needs first, without much pressure to sell. Unfortunately, that is no longer the case as they have started putting much more emphasis on selling and that's really unfortunate.

Morale is quite low across the whole retail side of the business. There is a reason several stores in the US have unionized...",,

2.0,Bunch of clowns,"App Review (Former Employee) - Cork, County Cork - October 3, 2022","Apple hired a bunch of clowns to manage the department. The managers are all underqualified and do not know how to do their job correctly. Most of the managers are hired from other departments (without going through interviewing process because they are friends with the senior manager). A very toxic and micromanaged work environment. The management team only cares about the numbers regardless of how heavy and more responsibility is on you. Career growth is not bright. The only growth is determined by how good your relationship is with your manager. No matter how hard you work for it, it all depends on the management team to decide if they want to promote you (whether you lick their shoes enough). The only good thing is the friendly and diverse colleagues that you will have. The rest ... umh ...",,

3.0,Bello e super stressante,"Specialist (Former Employee) - Milano, Lombardia - September 27, 2022","Apple tende ad assumere tante persone senza discriminazioni e/o limiti di età tendenzialmente verso l’inizio dell’estate, il tutto per avere persone che aiutino nelle vendite degli iPhone a Settembre e con le vendite natalizie. Per questo motivo i nuovi assunti a tempo determinato sono soprannominati: Natalini.

Apple è chiara: assume per tempo determinato, e pochissime sono le opportunità di rimanere. Anzi nulle, però 1/2 sono assunti (su un totale di 20/25).

L’ambiente lavorativo è bello e stimolante, tutto luccica e si vede che la sua base è proprio Americana; proprio per questo motivo, una volta che si inizia a lavorare, si ha una pressione immensa sul rendimento e RATING.

Ogni impiegato Apple ha un proprio punteggio, un rating, basato sulle vendite e recensioni degli utenti ad ogni scontrino: al di sotto di 5 stelle, la recensione è negativa e il lavoratore è preso di mira.

Lavorare nelle vendite è stressante, ed anche nell’assistenza Apple è rigida. Sempre si incentiva la vendita piuttosto che riparazione.

Home-based remote options, varying shift options, and a dedication to work/life balance are excellent too. Personally have made many friends and enjoyed the camaraderie that develops.

Negatives include: Promotional opportunities can feel limited, and competition is quite tough. Some roles can wear you down over time, or lose their luster / become boring. Metric goals can sometimes feel opposite to customer satisfaction.",,

On top of that you get a phone call every seven seconds and there are only 15 minute breaks if you are part time. I had to use the bathroom really bad one time and I was expected from the company to finish using the bathroom within two minutes or I was going to get in trouble. That was the most annoying part of the job and other things. You need to have tough skin to work for this company because you’re going to be dealing with some rude customers.

The benefits are great and beyond what most would need/use. However the ever increasing workload/expectations/metrics do not align with the pay or the end goal, which is helping the customer. You will be expected to work weekends/holidays without a say in your schedule. After 6 years of employment, all remote, the opportunities for advancement within the company were non-existent unless you wanted to work on campus and continue working in customer support.

Routinely they promoted failing employees over those who carried entire departments with no resources, encouragement, or leadership. Leadership makes decisions based on friendship, and expects you to work 24/7 without being compensated for being on-call.

The only tough thing about it is the lack of consistency with the start/end hours each week, and trying to RTO for things outside of work, even with vacation time.

I have worked for multiple Apple stores and can confirm that each operates a little differently depending on who the senior managers are and depending on what market you are in.

All in all, I would recommend Apple to most people. It can be exhausting, but worth the effort put in. The opportunities with Apple are literally endless, assuming you can get out of the retail sector of the company.",,

Take ownership of your work/life balance = happier you and happier customers.,"Specialist (Former Employee) - Toronto, ON - August 26, 2022","My short and concise review — Incredible company, incredible customers.

1.0,"Fun workplace, sad management","Sales Specialist (Former Employee) - Manchester, NH - August 26, 2022","Impossible to move around, managers clearly care about their own growth rather than yours, compensation is nice but only until you find someone there for 10 years is making the same amount as you. There is no tenure. There is no room for movement. Good first job. Sad career.",,
5.0,"A wonderful Company full, powered by beautiful people.","Mac Specialist/Technician/Mentor (Former Employee) - Ohio - August 26, 2022","I learned life long skills and made life long friends at Apple.

5.0,Culture d’entreprise à l’américaine très motivante,"SPÉCIALISTE (Former Employee) - Dijon (21) - August 26, 2022","Esprit d’équipe porté sur le progrès et l’évolution de chacun.
On apprend de nouvelles choses intéressantes chaque jour.

5.0,Favorite Retail Job,"Technical Specialist (Former Employee) - San Jose, CA - August 26, 2022","It was a good experience overall. I've worked retail ever since I turned 16, and Apple was by far my most favorite.

I met a lot of cool people through my location, and the management is always looking out for your best interest. They also almost always go out of their way to give honest positive feedback, and ensure you're always on a good path to promote within.

My favorite thing to take away from working at Apple is how I interact with people. I learned how to avoid and how to turn around a heated conversation.",,
5.0,Amazing,"Sales Manager (Former Employee) - Tysons Corner, VA - August 25, 2022",Apple is a life changer which people don't quite understand the value of those around you and the support the company gives to their employees. It is a special and unique experience which I have carried forward,,
5.0,Management promotes healthy and positive work environment.,"Specialist (Current Employee) - Edison, NJ - August 25, 2022","Apple is a great company to work for and a great team to join in as well. They help with individual and group setting needs to help achieve your goals no matter what they are, personal or professional.",,
