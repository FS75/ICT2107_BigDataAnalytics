4.0,Good place to work,"Scheduler (Former Employee) - CBD - December 6, 2018","As a contractor, you are not expected of much performance at the same time can't excel much for career advancement. Contract agents will get you in with a lower pay in the brand name of Google. Just need to be tactful on that.","Free food, flexible working (WFH)",Contractors' separation from Googlers. Could be bullied at times
3.0,Contractors are differently handled,"Manual QA Tester (Current Employee) - San Jose, CA - March 8, 2023","For contractors, this is not a good place. They are treated as laborers. workplace culture is not good. management is not transparent. requirements will not be clear. no team spirit. for contractors there is a separate building at San Jose. so, we don't get to meet googlers at all.",,
5.0,Lots to learn and good WLB,"Software Engineer Intern (Former Employee) - Seattle, WA - March 8, 2023","Everyone just does what makes sense. You learn a ton as everyone pushes each other in a healthy way while still maintaining WLB.

3.0,Company benefit is great and all but...,"Senior Associate (Former Employee) - Taguig City - March 3, 2023","But the management isn't pro-employee enough to defend a hard working employee from getting laid off. They laid off a hardworking, productive and performing employee and kept those non productive and non performing (metrics and attendance wise). They cannot even give a solid answer and just respond in a robotic way of ""it was a business decision"". That's not true because at some point, there are people who made the decision and the decision should be made logically.",,
5.0,Fun place,"Analyst (Former Employee) - New York, NY - March 3, 2023","It was a fun place to work, challenging, but learned a lot. It was a little slow at first but once you get into the swing of things there is always something to do.",,

3.0,Overall OK,"Administrative Business Partner (Former Employee) - Mountain View, CA - February 26, 2023","Work/life balance is great, (they encourage time off) Datacenter and office culture are very different. Very difficult to advance/transfer in a datacenter role vs a role that doesn't support a datacenter. Free training available, you just have to be proactive and search within the tools and resources given. Lots of meetings that take away from productivity. Below market in pay. Management differs at each site, I've had both good and very bad.",,
5.0,Great culture,"Program Manager (Former Employee) - Mountain View, CA - February 26, 2023","they hire you to get things done without much guidance which i appreciate.

I appreciate flexibility. Noticed far more dudes & non-BIPOC where i worked. Diversity is said to be important but not really reflected.,,
3.0,good,"Manager (Former Employee) - Las Vegas, NV - February 17, 2023","Coaching can require a delicate balance, as the second-ranked trait of good managers at Google is that they do not micromanage employees and, instead, empower their team to take control of their own work and projects. In other words, feedback and advice can be extremely helpful for employees, but they also need to be given enough reign to get their work done without constant interference that can cause delays and hurt performance.",,
1.0,Empire in decline,"Product Manager (Current Employee) - Mountain View, CA - February 16, 2023","Google has been the most dysfunctional place I've ever worked. The quality of leadership is poor, especially at the middle management level. Projects are often launched with the aim of someone getting a promotion, and then quickly axed.

If you care about building things that impact users and solve problems, this isn't the place to do it.",,

3.0,Productive,"IT Technician (Former Employee) - Washington, DC - February 13, 2023","Pros

1) Food, food, food. 15+ cafes on main campus (MTV) alone. Mini-kitchens, snacks, drinks, free breakfast/lunch/dinner, all day, errr'day.

2) Benefits/perks. Free 24:7 gym access (on MTV campus). Free (self service) laundry (washer/dryer) available. Bowling alley. Volley ball pit. Custom-built and exclusive employee use only outdoor sport park (MTV). Free health/fitness assessments. Dog-friendly. Etc. etc. etc.

3) Compensation. In ~2010 or 2011, Google updated its compensation packages so that they were more competitive.

4) For the size of the organization (30K+), it has remained relatively innovative, nimble, and fast-paced and open with communication but, that is definitely changing (for the worse).

5) With so many departments, focus areas, and products, *in theory*, you should have plenty of opportunity to grow your career (horizontally or vertically). In practice, not true.

6) You get to work with some of the brightest, most innovative and hard-working/diligent minds in the industry. There's a ""con"" to that, too (see below).

Cons

1) Work/life balance. What balance? All those perks and benefits are an illusion. They keep you at work and they help you to be more productive. I've never met anybody at Google who actually time off on weekends or on vacations. You may not hear management say, ""You have to work on weekends/vacations"" but, they set the culture by doing so - and it inevitably trickles down. I don't know if Google inadvertently hires the work-a-holics or if they create work-a-holics in us. Regardless, I have seen way too many of the following: marriages",,

4.0,Productive and fun work place,"Consultant (Current Employee) - Irvine, CA - February 9, 2023","Well they laid me off but would work again here. IT was great to work with the people, not so much trust in management deciding you are disposable even if you have good performance reviews.",,
2.0,They make it look good on the outside but that's a lie,"Data Center Technician (Former Employee) - Pryor, OK - February 9, 2023",It's a toxic place to be. Google puts a pretty bow on some pretty terrible things. You are expendable. The food may it may not be good. You get micromanaged. The culture had gone downhill.,,
5.0,Still the best place for a newbie,"Senior Software Engineer (Former Employee) - New York, NY - February 9, 2023","Despite everything that's been happening, Google is still one of the best employers to get your software engineering career off the ground. It's the best ""school"" for software engineers one could ask for. You learn a lot, get paid well, and don't get stressed out. Work isn't always exciting, but once you stay on a team for a while and earn the trust of colleagues, the interesting work tends to come in.

Finally, Google is still a business, so please don't believe all the fairy tales on the Internet.",,
5.0,Great workplace,"Program Manager (Current Employee) - New York, NY - February 9, 2023",Love it. Currently a program manager and its great. My team is very helpful and I am given a lot of time to learn material to help my team. The perks and office are a plus,,

2.0,Laid off Golden12k,"Sales Assistant (Former Employee) - Singapore - February 8, 2023","Layoffs due to global tech firing. Overall decent company to work with, but dependent on team and bosses.

1.0,Cool but stessful,"Janitor (Former Employee) - Toronto, ON - February 7, 2023","Cool but stressful environment and workspace, would recommend for new graduated but other than that, it is not worth joining. Has become very disorganized.",,
2.0,"Used to be great, now it's a ""conventional"" company","Senior Account Executive (Former Employee) - Atlanta, GA - February 6, 2023","(Most) Sales managers are not leaders, but rule because of their rank. Managers are not inspirational and are simply looking for more power through land grabs, taking credit for employees great work, calling them out on the poor work and don't care about helping those that report to them.

Great work goes unappreciated as managers focus on what you're doing wrong.

Trust is lost, there is no psychological safety any longer. I feel for those remaining at the company. It's so much better being on the outside looking in.",,
4.0,Fun work place,"Graphic Designer (Former Employee) - Toronto, ON - February 6, 2023","Working as a graphic designer at Google was a challenging but fun experience. The company demands the highest level of excellence from its employees, and this was reflected in the demanding and fast-paced work environment. However, despite the challenges, I found the atmosphere to be incredibly supportive and collaborative, making it a truly enjoyable place to work. The opportunity to work with some of the best and brightest minds in the industry was a highlight of my time at Google, and I was constantly learning and growing as a designer.",,
5.0,"Good pay, great WLB, but negative outlook on leadership.","Software Engineer (Current Employee) - Mountain View, CA - February 3, 2023","Google has been known as a top place to work at for technologists for quite some time now. Smart people, interesting projects, free food and good benefits.

Only think I dislike is spineless leadership and a decaying sense of job security with the recent layoff of over 12k+ people, a good portion of which were well-respected people.

Leadership never gives clear answers and take definitive stands, especially in regards to Googlers.",,
4.0,Amazing perks but unstable due to economy,"Software Engineer (Former Employee) - Mountain View, CA - February 3, 2023","Amazing place to work. Tons of brilliant engineers and talented people.

5.0,Dream Job,"Recruiter (Former Employee) - Mountain View, CA - February 1, 2023","This company is an absolute dream to work for. Granted, I was a contractor, although my experience was still seamless. It is a bummer that we experienced so many lay offs recently which makes them lose a great deal of respect and trust. My time there was spent always having a new adventure. There were so many different easter eggs to find, lots of different events and restaurants to attend to frequently. Everyday was filled with free food and coffee, a dream come true. Both of my dotted line managers were incredible. My team always showed that they cared for me and was willing to do anything they possibly could to allow me to succeed.",,
2.0,Decent career growth but broken performance evaluation system,"Regional product lead (Current Employee) - San Fransisco - January 31, 2023","Google has some great opportunities to grow within the company and learn new skills. Overall, the benefits and work life balance are good. However, the company rarely holds managers accountable for their performance and most of it's performance evaluation systems incentivize behaviors that may not be aligned to the long term success of the company. This causes people to work for promo projects and create unnecessary and useless work which eats up from the actual value and productivity they could have brought to their jobs",,
5.0,Good work-life balance and management,"Software Engineer (Former Employee) - Sunnyvale, CA - January 30, 2023",There is no micromanagement from my manager and I learned a lot from my colleagues.

It was hard to survive if you have only a background in design , web development. You must have knowledge of CS concept clear.

You have a 50% chance of getting a toxic boss. And I mean bosses that make you feel like your life should revolve around them. It’s not micromanaged but more like a cult where you get sucked into the culture and feel guilty for ever looking for something better. They have kids and pets and family that you get emotionally invested and it’s hard to pull yourself out of a culture like that.

You never know if an award is really an award or a way to manipulate and control you. Like I did this for you and you owe me now. It’s an emotional debt you can never pay.

But all of this comes with clear expectations to perform. Also, the large size of the company means that many senior managers are external hires and they bring with them the cultural baggage of their previous employers. The interview process is meant to ensure cultural fit, but no process is perfect. The result is that the culture can vary a lot from office to office or team to team within larger offices.",,

Biggest downside is the pay. Adecco does the recruiting, drivers are paid the same rate across the country. $15 an hour, which is the pay, is very different in Massachusetts is comparison to Alabama. There is absolutely no overtime either. So people that are capable of driving even longer per day, or want to work an extra day on the weekend, are unable to do that.

5.0,Productive and fun workplace,"Software Engineer (Former Employee) - San Francisco, CA - November 8, 2021","Productive and fun workplace, Pros

1) Food, food, food. 15+ cafes on main campus (MTV) alone. Mini-kitchens, snacks, drinks, free breakfast/lunch/dinner, all day, errr'day.

2) Benefits/perks. Free 24:7 gym access (on MTV campus). Free (self service) laundry (washer/dryer) available. Bowling alley. Volley ball pit. Custom-built and exclusive employee use only outdoor sport park (MTV). Free health/fitness assessments. Dog-friendly. Etc. etc. etc.

3) Compensation. In ~2010 or 2011, Google updated its compensation packages so that they were more competitive.

4) For the size of the organization (30K+), it has remained relatively innovative, nimble, and fast-paced and open with communication but, that is definitely changing (for the worse).

5) With so many departments, focus areas, and products, *in theory*, you should have plenty of opportunity to grow your career (horizontally or vertically). In practice, not true.

6) You get to work with some of the brightest, most innovative and hard-working/diligent minds in the industry. There's a ""con"" to that, too (see below).

Cons

1) Work/life balance. What balance? All those perks and benefits are an illusion. They keep you at work and they help you to be more productive. I've never met anybody at Google who actually time off on weekends or on vacations. You may not hear management say, ""You have to work on weekends/vacations"" but, they set the culture by doing so - and it inevitably trickles down. I don't know if Google inadvertently hires the work-a-holics or if they create work-a-holics in us. Regardless, I have seen way too many",,

4.0,"Great for FTE, contractors beware!","Application Engineer (Current Employee) - Poland - November 5, 2021","First of all, amazing tech stack, great engineers, interesting projects, more knowledge and resources available than you can handle. You have to learn all the time and not stick to some specific stack as there's constant development and deprecation going on. Not the environment for everybody but if you have a boy-scout attitude you will be happy there. I am for this part.

For the organizational aspects it's not great though. A lot of chaotic changes happened just so that someone can have a great performance evaluation to jump to another team after which the project is forgotten (I've seen it happen many times). It's amazing how many resources are wasted for meaningless work. It's sad to see engineers taking over management tasks from incompetent managers just to get work done.

For the cultural part, don't be fooled - it's not the same open and inclusive company as it used to be. People get fired for saying the ugly truth. The hierarchy is much more enforced than it used to be (in my org tree). Make sure you work there as a full-time employee (FTE) and not let's say a contractor. If you're a contractor like me, doing the same full-time engineering work as my FTE peers and for many years just on different contract (but same NDAs), prepare for getting different treatment. This is sad especially that the majority of the workforce are contractors/vendors etc. Some examples:
- I need to pass some security trainings annually which say that contractors/temps/vendors are trouble and a security threat.
- I receive a lot of company-wide communication inviting me to events and trainings",,

5.0,"Overall great company, smart people and great benefits","Account Executive (Current Employee) - New York, NY - October 19, 2021","WFH at the moment with the option to go into the office. Good amount of time with clients but way too many internal meetings. Self promotion and side projects are keys to success, not necessarily your day to day tasks. Many opportunities to learn and network and you can fill that in with other trainings on diversity and personal growth. Culture varies by team, but for the most part everyone is friendly and willing to help. Total opposite of 'cut-throat.' However, that also breeds some complacency.

Hardest part of the job sometimes is staying motivated because there's little incentive to keep pushing at times. Loads of filler meetings where nothing gets accomplished.

Best part is work/life balance, benefits and team culture. Worst part is up-leveling your position in the company (management track is non-existent), the promotion process (only getting harder and longer for long time Googlers), and the inability to obtain more money (no room to ask for a 'raise' as it's all done algorithmically and even in sales it's fairly difficult to blow your quota out of the water, albeit you will usually hit your goals or come close).","Free lunches, cell phone reimbursement, gym reimbursement, great 401K match, backdoor 401K eligibility, solid WLB, global reset days (days off), very smart colleagues, management that seemingly cares about you as a person. 3 days in office, 2 days home.","salary/bonus is a bit light compared to FAANGs, mandatory RTO, career movement is very difficult, intolerable promotion process, rampant complacency."

Dog-friendly. Etc. etc. etc. 3) Compensation. In ~2010 or 2011, Google updated its compensation packages so that they were more competitive. 4) For the size of the organization (30K+), it has remained relatively innovative, nimble, and fast-paced and open with communication but, that is definitely changing (for the worse). 5) With so many departments, focus areas, and products, *in theory*, you should have plenty of opportunity to grow your career (horizontally or vertically). In practice, not true. 6) You get to work with some of the brightest, most innovative and hard-working/diligent minds in the industry. There's a ""con"" to that, too (see below).",,
