below ChatGPT generated CONTENT.

As an AI language model, I don't have personal experience working at Google, but I can provide you with information about what it's like to work at Google based on research and feedback from employees.

Google is one of the world's largest and most successful technology companies, and it is known for its innovative and fun work culture. Employees are offered a range of perks and benefits, such as free meals, onsite gym, and wellness programs. Google also emphasizes employee growth and development, offering opportunities for education and training, as well as the chance to work on exciting and impactful projects.

Google's work environment is collaborative and team-oriented, with a focus on open communication and sharing ideas. Employees are encouraged to be creative and think outside the box, and there are many opportunities for cross-functional collaboration and learning.

However, some employees have also reported challenges with the high workload and long hours required to keep up with the fast-paced and competitive environment. The work can also be demanding and high-pressure, with tight deadlines and high expectations.

Overall, working at Google is generally considered a great experience, with many opportunities for growth and development, exciting projects, and a fun and collaborative work culture. However, it is important to be prepared for a demanding and competitive work environment.",,,User,Former Employee,Antartica,"March 8, 2023"

3.0,Company benefit is great and all but...,"But the management isn't pro-employee enough to defend a hard working employee from getting laid off. They laid off a hardworking, productive and performing employee and kept those non productive and non performing (metrics and attendance wise). They cannot even give a solid answer and just respond in a robotic way of ""it was a business decision"". That's not true because at some point, there are people who made the decision and the decision should be made logically.",,,Senior Associate,Former Employee,Taguig City,"March 3, 2023"

3.0,Overall OK,"Work/life balance is great, (they encourage time off) Datacenter and office culture are very different. Very difficult to advance/transfer in a datacenter role vs a role that doesn't support a datacenter. Free training available, you just have to be proactive and search within the tools and resources given. Lots of meetings that take away from productivity. Below market in pay. Management differs at each site, I've had both good and very bad.",,,Administrative Business Partner,Former Employee,"Mountain View, CA","February 26, 2023"
5.0,Great culture,"they hire you to get things done without much guidance which i appreciate. The culture is amazing, the people are great, food is 10/10.

Noticed far more dudes & non-BIPOC where i worked. Diversity is said to be important but not really reflected.,,,Intern,Former Employee,Remote,"February 17, 2023"
3.0,good,"Coaching can require a delicate balance, as the second-ranked trait of good managers at Google is that they do not micromanage employees and, instead, empower their team to take control of their own work and projects. In other words, feedback and advice can be extremely helpful for employees, but they also need to be given enough reign to get their work done without constant interference that can cause delays and hurt performance.",,,Manager,Former Employee,"Las Vegas, NV","February 17, 2023"
1.0,Empire in decline,"Google has been the most dysfunctional place I've ever worked. The quality of leadership is poor, especially at the middle management level. Projects are often launched with the aim of someone getting a promotion, and then quickly axed.

3.0,Productive,"Pros

1) Food, food, food. 15+ cafes on main campus (MTV) alone. Mini-kitchens, snacks, drinks, free breakfast/lunch/dinner, all day, errr'day.

2) Benefits/perks. Free 24:7 gym access (on MTV campus). Free (self service) laundry (washer/dryer) available. Bowling alley. Volley ball pit. Custom-built and exclusive employee use only outdoor sport park (MTV). Free health/fitness assessments. Dog-friendly. Etc. etc. etc.

3) Compensation. In ~2010 or 2011, Google updated its compensation packages so that they were more competitive.

4) For the size of the organization (30K+), it has remained relatively innovative, nimble, and fast-paced and open with communication but, that is definitely changing (for the worse).

5) With so many departments, focus areas, and products, *in theory*, you should have plenty of opportunity to grow your career (horizontally or vertically). In practice, not true.

6) You get to work with some of the brightest, most innovative and hard-working/diligent minds in the industry. There's a ""con"" to that, too (see below).

Cons

1) Work/life balance. What balance? All those perks and benefits are an illusion. They keep you at work and they help you to be more productive. I've never met anybody at Google who actually time off on weekends or on vacations. You may not hear management say, ""You have to work on weekends/vacations"" but, they set the culture by doing so - and it inevitably trickles down. I don't know if Google inadvertently hires the work-a-holics or if they create work-a-holics in us. Regardless, I have seen way too many of the following: marriages",,,IT Technician,Former Employee,"Washington, DC","February 13, 2023"

2.0,They make it look good on the outside but that's a lie,It's a toxic place to be. Google puts a pretty bow on some pretty terrible things. You are expendable. The food may it may not be good. You get micromanaged. The culture had gone downhill.,,,Data Center Technician,Former Employee,"Pryor, OK","February 9, 2023"
5.0,Still the best place for a newbie,"Despite everything that's been happening, Google is still one of the best employers to get your software engineering career off the ground. It's the best ""school"" for software engineers one could ask for. You learn a lot, get paid well, and don't get stressed out. Work isn't always exciting, but once you stay on a team for a while and earn the trust of colleagues, the interesting work tends to come in.

Finally, Google is still a business, so please don't believe all the fairy tales on the Internet.",,,Senior Software Engineer,Former Employee,"New York, NY","February 9, 2023"

2.0,"Used to be great, now it's a ""conventional"" company","(Most) Sales managers are not leaders, but rule because of their rank. Managers are not inspirational and are simply looking for more power through land grabs, taking credit for employees great work, calling them out on the poor work and don't care about helping those that report to them.

Great work goes unappreciated as managers focus on what you're doing wrong.

Trust is lost, there is no psychological safety any longer. I feel for those remaining at the company. It's so much better being on the outside looking in.",,,Senior Account Executive,Former Employee,"Atlanta, GA","February 6, 2023"

5.0,"Good pay, great WLB, but negative outlook on leadership.","Google has been known as a top place to work at for technologists for quite some time now. Smart people, interesting projects, free food and good benefits.

Only think I dislike is spineless leadership and a decaying sense of job security with the recent layoff of over 12k+ people, a good portion of which were well-respected people.

Leadership never gives clear answers and take definitive stands, especially in regards to Googlers.",,,Software Engineer,Current Employee,"Mountain View, CA","February 3, 2023"

5.0,Dream Job,"This company is an absolute dream to work for. Granted, I was a contractor, although my experience was still seamless. It is a bummer that we experienced so many lay offs recently which makes them lose a great deal of respect and trust. My time there was spent always having a new adventure.

I’ve had apathetic managers and I’ve had hyper energy managers, and I’ve had managers that were good coaches: that’s the kind you want and that’s who I have now. Been here over 10 years so I’ve seen a lot here.

General culture in the global business organization (not pure sales): hard-working, friendly people who care about doing their jobs well. Managers that care about work life balance. I think this is the sweet spot: sales seems too high pressure and eng still seems to have too little emotional intelligence and too much pressure on employees.

3.0,Fun place to work but leaves you feeling paranoid.,"Google is one of those dreams everyone hopes to fulfill. It’s great the first year or two. But getting promoted is really a punishment. Yeah you get great benefits and decent pay. But management is hit or miss. You have a 50% chance of getting a toxic boss. And I mean bosses that make you feel like your life should revolve around them. It’s not micromanaged but more like a cult where you get sucked into the culture and feel guilty for ever looking for something better. They have kids and pets and family that you get emotionally invested and it’s hard to pull yourself out of a culture like that.

You never know if an award is really an award or a way to manipulate and control you. Like I did this for you and you owe me now. It’s an emotional debt you can never pay. When you have a great boss, you feel the same level of paranoia where you aren’t sure if it’s corporate gaslighting culture or you aren’t appreciative enough.

Not only are the staff very nice, but the job also pays well too. One thing that really helped me in this company was the food and snack program. When I graduated from college and just got into the company I was struggling with money. I was unable to afford a plate to eat but after getting into the company I was able to eat due to the free lunches and snacks provided, and keep myself energized which enhanced my working ability.

4.0,"In general, Google lives up to its billing as a great place to work, although there are differences between offices and teams.","Google certainly spoils its employees with all of the well known perks: free meals, funky offices, etc. And while many people will complain about pay, the truth is that Googlers are generally very well compensated.
But all of this comes with clear expectations to perform. Also, the large size of the company means that many senior managers are external hires and they bring with them the cultural baggage of their previous employers. The interview process is meant to ensure cultural fit, but no process is perfect. The result is that the culture can vary a lot from office to office or team to team within larger offices.",,,GLOBAL CLIENT EXECUTIVE,Former Employee,Paris,"February 6, 2022"
4.0,Pretty solid,"Once you get in the groove of things and if you're a good driver it is quite an easy job. Pretty nice to be able to listen to music/podcasts and visit new cities daily.
Biggest downside is the pay. Adecco does the recruiting, drivers are paid the same rate across the country. $15 an hour, which is the pay, is very different in Massachusetts is comparison to Alabama. There is absolutely no overtime either. So people that are capable of driving even longer per day, or want to work an extra day on the weekend, are unable to do that.

5.0,Productive and fun workplace,"Productive and fun workplace, Pros

1) Food, food, food. 15+ cafes on main campus (MTV) alone. Mini-kitchens, snacks, drinks, free breakfast/lunch/dinner, all day, errr'day.

2) Benefits/perks. Free 24:7 gym access (on MTV campus). Free (self service) laundry (washer/dryer) available. Bowling alley. Volley ball pit. Custom-built and exclusive employee use only outdoor sport park (MTV). Free health/fitness assessments. Dog-friendly. Etc. etc. etc.

3) Compensation. In ~2010 or 2011, Google updated its compensation packages so that they were more competitive.

4) For the size of the organization (30K+), it has remained relatively innovative, nimble, and fast-paced and open with communication but, that is definitely changing (for the worse).

5) With so many departments, focus areas, and products, *in theory*, you should have plenty of opportunity to grow your career (horizontally or vertically). In practice, not true.

6) You get to work with some of the brightest, most innovative and hard-working/diligent minds in the industry. There's a ""con"" to that, too (see below).

Cons

1) Work/life balance. What balance? All those perks and benefits are an illusion. They keep you at work and they help you to be more productive. I've never met anybody at Google who actually time off on weekends or on vacations. You may not hear management say, ""You have to work on weekends/vacations"" but, they set the culture by doing so - and it inevitably trickles down. I don't know if Google inadvertently hires the work-a-holics or if they create work-a-holics in us. Regardless, I have seen way too many",,,Software Engineer,Former Employee,"San Francisco, CA","November 8, 2021"

4.0,"Great for FTE, contractors beware!","First of all, amazing tech stack, great engineers, interesting projects, more knowledge and resources available than you can handle. You have to learn all the time and not stick to some specific stack as there's constant development and deprecation going on. Not the environment for everybody but if you have a boy-scout attitude you will be happy there. I am for this part.

For the organizational aspects it's not great though. A lot of chaotic changes happened just so that someone can have a great performance evaluation to jump to another team after which the project is forgotten (I've seen it happen many times). It's amazing how many resources are wasted for meaningless work. It's sad to see engineers taking over management tasks from incompetent managers just to get work done.

For the cultural part, don't be fooled - it's not the same open and inclusive company as it used to be. People get fired for saying the ugly truth. The hierarchy is much more enforced than it used to be (in my org tree). Make sure you work there as a full-time employee (FTE) and not let's say a contractor. If you're a contractor like me, doing the same full-time engineering work as my FTE peers and for many years just on different contract (but same NDAs), prepare for getting different treatment. This is sad especially that the majority of the workforce are contractors/vendors etc. Some examples:
- I need to pass some security trainings annually which say that contractors/temps/vendors are trouble and a security threat.
- I receive a lot of company-wide communication inviting me to events and trainings -

5.0,"Overall great company, smart people and great benefits","WFH at the moment with the option to go into the office. Good amount of time with clients but way too many internal meetings. Self promotion and side projects are keys to success, not necessarily your day to day tasks. Many opportunities to learn and network and you can fill that in with other trainings on diversity and personal growth. Culture varies by team, but for the most part everyone is friendly and willing to help. Total opposite of 'cut-throat.' However, that also breeds some complacency.

Hardest part of the job sometimes is staying motivated because there's little incentive to keep pushing at times. Loads of filler meetings where nothing gets accomplished.

Best part is work/life balance, benefits and team culture. Worst part is up-leveling your position in the company (management track is non-existent), the promotion process (only getting harder and longer for long time Googlers), and the inability to obtain more money (no room to ask for a 'raise' as it's all done algorithmically and even in sales it's fairly difficult to blow your quota out of the water, albeit you will usually hit your goals or come close).",,,Account Executive,Current Employee,"New York, NY","October 19, 2021"

1) Food, food, food. 15+ cafes on main campus (MTV) alone. Mini-kitchens, snacks, drinks, free breakfast/lunch/dinner, all day, errr'day. 2) Benefits/perks. Free 24:7 gym access (on MTV campus). Free (self service) laundry (washer/dryer) available. Bowling alley. Volley ball pit. Custom-built and exclusive employee use only outdoor sport park (MTV). Free health/fitness assessments. Dog-friendly. Etc. etc. etc. 3) Compensation. In ~2010 or 2011, Google updated its compensation packages so that they were more competitive. 4) For the size of the organization (30K+), it has remained relatively innovative, nimble, and fast-paced and open with communication but, that is definitely changing (for the worse). 5) With so many departments, focus areas, and products, *in theory*, you should have plenty of opportunity to grow your career (horizontally or vertically). In practice, not true. 6) You get to work with some of the brightest, most innovative and hard-working/diligent minds in the industry.

1.0,Extremely poor management and exclusion of contract workers,"Was working for Google on behalf of a recruitment agency (on a contract). It is the worst experience I have ever had in my career. I am a senior employee with lots of experience and have always enjoyed being a consultant. At Google, consultants are not treated like human beings. The management swore at me and the team constantly, gave timelines on projects that did not take any consideration of weekends, holidays, etc. We are not allowed to ‘speak to Googlers’ (these exact words are used) - we are only allowed to speak to our recruitment agency, but Googlers are allowed to speak to as in any way they want, when they so wish.

We cannot complain, we do not get any benefits. Since the pandemic we have worked from home and we got nothing to help us. No budget for desks, no budget for extra screens. No questions of how we were doing. I have never in my career experiences worse treatment of human beings in a workplace and I am very happy that I can find a job elsewhere.

FWIW, Join google for brand name, worklife balance and compensation and try to join from junior to mid level engineer or senior manager.

Work hours are whatever I see fit and I have been provided with everything to equip my WFH environment. The offices are amazing and it's the first time I look forward to going there. The benefits and perks are great, you are actually encourage to take leaves, PTO and enjoy extra days off.
Once you have a certain tenure, be prepared to deliver or be left behind. This is a meritocracy and just sitting around doing nothing will get out of the door.

Most of the ""employees"" were actually temps/contract workers, so benefits did not exist. IF you got hired trip be a ""googler,"" then you would be eligible, but it's very rare to actually get hired on.

Managers are not well trained, they have many people who they manage, and they do not provide proactive advice or support. It is difficult to speak with leadership, and when leadership finally has time to connect, in my experience, I feel like I am never heard, and my issues take multiple ""at-bats"" to be solved.

3.0,Contractor Engineer at Google,"Depends on your department, but from what I've seen is contractors are held very low at Google. There is little to no flexibility, especially when asking for time-off. There is basically no support from managers expect to meet job quotas and contractors are severely underpaid compared to their full-time employed co-workers who do literally the same job. And no matter what, don't trust recruiters when they say conversion is possible. Seriously, with the recent re-orgs and budget changes, head-count availability changes almost daily. I've seen contractors either laid off after their contract ends or pushed to become a vendor so there's less limitations on how long they can work at Google.

On the bright side, they are implementing a standard for contractors to get some more benefits from their hiring companies, can't say if this affects the hourly wage as I've left a while ago in search for better pay.",,,Contract Engineer,Former Employee,"Mountain View, CA","July 16, 2020"

Positive Outlook

No opinion of CEO

I worked at Google (Less than a year)

Pros

The people are very nice and smart. the dress is casual. the cubicles are quiet. The food is good. A fun place to work.
The security staff is nice, and some will become good friends.

Cons

The datacenter never has enough tools.
You feel completely alone and it seems that you shouldn't ask questions once you're let loose post-trainig.
I broke down crying a few times on the datacenter floor because I couldn't find any answers or documentation from their intranet or from other employees.
They want a phd level of intelligence to work for 20$/hr.
Atlanta is the neglected ""redheaded stepchild"" data center.
Can be somewhat political, but if you don't get involved with or discuss politics anywhere on memegen or on the internal mailing lists or if you're smart enough to be engage in a neutral manner or pretend to side with the ""correct"" politics rather than your own political beliefs, you'll be alright.
I sweat a lot, and no one told me that I could bring spill-proof tumblers or clear drink containers on the DC floor!

The training was excellent. But safety protocols conflict with the speed that repairs MUST be accomplished. Eg: you must take shortcuts, like not wear globes when doing battery swaps, even if it's not safe. I was probably fired for not wearing gloves during the week that safety inspectors were onsite, however I was never told that they even have gloves or where they were!

2.0,Toxic Culture and Incompetent Managers,"The marketing culture (not the engineering culture, mind you) is toxic and getting worse. New managers are brought in and pretend to be kind and genuinely care about your personal growth as long as their probation lasts. When their probation ends, you quickly realize that yelling and humiliating in public are the only management tools that they intend to keep. And they will keep yelling and humiliating until your projects hit a dead end and have to give up and leave your job so that there's more room left for new hires, also known as ""my people"" new hires.

3.0,Pampers employees too much to the point of distraction; frontend developer skills will languish,"* Perks are too much really, and I would feel guilty complaining about any of them. However, I'd much rather give up all my perks for the opportunity to work from home instead.
* Was very frustrating from the perspective of an employee of a startup that was acquired. After getting acquired, all the state-of-the-art competitive software had to be re-written to fit Google's standards: coding style, build tools, and software libraries and protocols. This felt the opposite of freedom. Also, it was super hard even getting our first code checked into the monolithic codebase, as no one in the company had ""readability"" in any programming languages. As such, we had to hire folks from other parts of Google, as well as get ""buddies"" within Google to help review our code. More handcuffs...
* Mostly young workforce, with many from privileged backgrounds, with highly materialistic wants. ""Smart"" gets thrown around a lot. There are many smart people, and also many weird characters. As someone who came in through an acquisition, I increasingly felt that I just didn't belong there, as I'd skipped the entire interview process.
* A very stable build system and well-written tech stack, at the cost of severe NIH, overall developmental slowness, and very outdated tech. No opportunity to code with React.js, a very dominant framework used outside of Google (competing with Angular 2)
* Frontend developers are not really taken seriously. JavaScript is barely tolerated as a ""real language"" and the tech stack and build tools were completely disparate from the real world.",,,Software Engineer,Former Employee,"Mountain View, CA","October 12, 2019"

4.0,Great company! Great senior leadership! Awful immediate supervisor!,"My general experience at Google was positive.
However, the internship could have been more organized. I didn't work directly for the manger who appraised my performance. Therefore, there was a disconnect between the impression that my supervisor had and the one that my appraiser had. Also, the person who appraised my work was just a very critical person who always look to blame people that she over saw.

It took weeks to get my credentials figured out so I could use email and to use the build system. Security is tight there, and slow. My access to the building took two or more weeks to clear. I was not able to access all of the code I needed to do my job.

The worst part is that contractors are treated as a security risk, so they get no heads up when there services are no longer needed. Just a simple ""this is your last day. Clean up your desk, leave your computer, and head out."" That's it.

I assume that this technique limits security risk, but from a personal standpoint, it was not fun.",,,Test Software Developer,Former Employee,"Mountain View, CA","September 26, 2019"

2.0,Terrible departments make for terrible lives,"I almost never knew the ""greater picture"" of where my team was headed, because the entire department seemed to have no clue. I would be told something by someone on my team who heard it in passing from our manager, and then the exact opposite would happen in two weeks. Even when that manager quit, the same things kept happening, and even when I switched teams (within the same department), so I believe the entire department was rotting from the head.

I saw excessive amounts of waste at every turn. Corporate culture is one of laziness and complacency, to the point where trying to pick up extra work that is technically beyond the scope of your job title will actually penalize you. I had to argue for weeks to convince a senior engineer to make a one line, basic change to top of rack switch because he simply didn't want to do it, and there was literally no recourse for me (I quit before he did, if he ever did).

There are also some really sketchy activity going on inside, and attempts at bringing said activity to light will most likely only end poorly for you.

Overall, it started off great when I was still enamored by the name ""Google"" and was but a lowly peon. But as my team members quickly quit and my responsibilities expanded to encompass their old duties (because hiring for your team is also a nightmare), I saw more and more of the grit beneath the glamor. I have no intention of ever working for Google again.

However, if I had to leave early for my personal issues, I only have to notify my supervisors and finish the rest of the task the next day. The flexibility was really helpful and enjoyable. I also learned to manage my time during each section because of different priorities. Overall, I think the hardest part was to learn all the technologies that were used for the tasks. Nevertheless, once I got it down, I was able to finish everything really quickly. Last but not least, free meals and facilities really save me a lot of money.

4.0,An excellent place to start you career and learn the basics. Not much room to grow.,"Pros:
+ At Google you're standing on the shoulders of giants. They've built the best developer tools and a wealth of great internal documentation for technologies and engineering practices. During my first few months at Google I learned a ton from internal resources and learning about their technical infrastructure.
+ Overall good culture of transparency, giving voice to employees, and trying to make sure employees are happy.
+ Good compensation.

Cons:
Google is huge, and this has a number of consequences. For one, many engineering teams move very slowly. Lots of red tape, and lots of huge systems to integrate with. Very deep management chains. For an individual contributor, decisions may be made many levels above you and you have very little input or context.

Depending on the team, it can be hard to have meaningful impact at Google. Some systems are so old they are already fully optimized, others are just so large that you're unlikely to touch more than a small piece or sub system. Most engineers at Google aren't solving the worlds hardest/funnest problems--their just manning the ship, making sure things don't break and adding small incremental improvements. Getting into ""sexy"" product areas is extremely competitive.",,,"Software Engineer III, Platforms Storage",Current Employee,"Sunnyvale, CA","June 11, 2019"

4.0,"I love the culture, however, not much room for advancement for TVC's","This review is for the other half of Google that works as a TVC (Temporary, Vendor, Contractor). I believe it's important, because that is what more than half the people who work there are, and the ratio of employee to TVC shrinks yearly. I am a vendor, and overall I will say have been treated well, and with kindness and respect. My only real issue is that despite many years working there, it's very hard to be made from a vendor to a permanent employee, and there is little room for advancement. If you are a TVC, you'll have to remember that overall, that is the case. Unless you are excellent at what you do and happen to be at the right place at the right time, you'll probably do best to work there, get a solid reputation and skillset, and then use the Google name to go somewhere else.

I was on the pre-sales team and so I was directly dependent upon my post-sales team to accomplish the remainder of the sale which they often failed which impacted my quota and left animosity amongst my manager and myself.

1.0,Mass Exodus,"Some nice people, some smart people, and you're part of something that is helping people. Unfortunately the company is poorly managed at most levels and faces strong competition at both the high and low end. Basic project management precepts like how to prioritize and manage scope, cost, and schedule seems beyond them. Managing feature creep at the product definition phase is one of their biggest weaknesses. These over featured products then go into development, the aspirational features that would have been market differentiators have development issues that then affect schedule and/or cost, people live in China for months, and eventually something less than desired reaches the market late with poor financials. However lately it isn't even aspirational features that are burdening product definitions. It's just trying to keep up with released features on competitors products. Meanwhile Xiaomi sells it cheaper, Garmin sells it better, and Apple sells it cooler. Fitbit is at most two bad product intros away from oblivion.

This has triggered a mass exodus of talent, which Fitbit has encouraged, augmented by several small, stealth layoffs. Its current financials are challenged enough that it can't afford to keep the people that it needs. The overall effect creates this kind of dark mood, intensified by the increasing number of empty desks, that pervades the organization. No one is surprised any more to hear that a colleague has left. There's more a feeling of being happy for them that they found a way out, maybe with some quiet envy.

4.0,Great experience even as a contractor..,"I love working at Google! If you get a chance to work here, definitely do it! Whether you come in as a contractor or a permanent employee, you definitely will get the experience of a lifetime.

With that being said.. I do feel like contractors (known as TVCs) are treated differently. I still think there is an overall great culture, but I wish they gave TVCs some of the resources they give permanent employees. Part of the reason I'm open to other opportunities is that there really isn't a clear path to conversion, the line is pretty blurred. Not to mention you have to re-interview for it.

Google loves people that ""thrive in ambiguity"" but as a TVC it's a little concerning when you don't have much guidance on how to push for conversion. You are essentially doing the exact same job as permanent employees, but apart from good numbers they want to see other intangibles to really have a strong case for conversion. Some of the top performers on my team were TVCs but unfortunately are not at Google anymore because they didn't make it through the conversion process.

Would I take this job as a TVC again? Probably. I admire this company and love how much you grow as a professional. I am definitely still gonna give the conversion process a shot, but I'm also realistic and know I need to be keeping my options open.","Culture, Great Food, Great Ammenities, Great Work/Life Balance, Great people","Ambiguity, No clear career trajectory for TVCs",Sourcing Recruiter,Current Employee,"Austin, TX","February 11, 2019"

I would recommend this job to people who are just stepping their foot into the workforce or people who need extra cash. I enjoyed the bond I made with fellow coworkers, there were a great bunch of people on the team. One negative aspect is that the contract is only a year and after 3 months you are eligible to reapply. Another one is that you are not informed about exactly when your contract is close to being up so you can prepare yourself to look for another job. However, overall the job is not that bad for the one year you're allowed to work there.",,,Store Operator,Former Employee,"Washington, DC","January 28, 2019"

Many hotels struggle with low occupancy, underutilizing their investment. I consistently drive higher occupancy into our hotel. I don’t just manage a couple of rooms, I help them fill a whole hotel. Most hotels don’t have effective rate plan, promotional and pricing strategies. To maximize overall revenue per room, i fix that.

1.0,Poor management style at Google,"Management at Google has very low regard for anyone who comes in as a contractor. Very low percentages of people will get converted into a direct position, regardless of the quality of your work.

In addition, if you work as a contractor, they will not allow you to have the information that you need to do your job. You will also not be allowed to attend meetings to discuss the information that you need.

The smartest thing that you can do is just avoid the company altogether, unless they offer you a direct position with good pay and benefits for the area where you are located.

She expected people to be on from morning until evening, and set goals that were impossible to reach without 80-hour workweeks.

4.0,TVC Life sucks,"Google is an amazing company, with lots of amazing perks... If you are a FTE or ""Googler"" If you are a TVC ""contractor"" then none of that applies to you. You are paid almost nothing and expected to do the same, sometimes maybe even more work than full time Google employees are expected to do. You may be given a day off because Google is off, but some of us don't get paid for those days. When you are working on a budget that is really hard some days (especially near the holidays) Work is very stressful at times and instead of finding ways to improve our work environment, they take more things away.

1.0,"Fake Culture of ""Transparency""","Management preaches ""transparency"" but does not practice it. Managers exclude engineers from meetings in which their deliverables are discussed with stakeholders and then present the decisions as ""personal goals.""

Managers do not understand the technology they order engineers to use. They don't care. Their priorities are to tell management above them what it wants to hear.

Fitbit says that it wanted to convert contract employees to full-time after six months, but it often takes a year. Employees on work visas frequently have their conversions delayed even longer, which keeps them dependent on the company.

Management does a very poor job of managing itself. Oversized egos remain oversized. Fitbit is good at promoting Dr Jekyll and clueless when it comes to dealing with Mr Hyde.

3.0,"Must be highly self-actualized, to thrive in a sometimes chaotic culture","Google is great for Engineers. For managers of product, process, projects or of people you often have to ""create your job"", and maintain a high-performance image. You are told to do this by building your internal resume. And you should, always noting your ""impact"". You need to define your role and make sure your manager and your stakeholders understand it and agree. You may think hear you have the charter to blaze a new trail, but you need to be careful, there is a lot of coopetition, and some people would like to see you fail. Some people are guarding their territory and they don't think they need to align with your new process or whatever - and they don't . It's a tough place for a new ""expert"" type who's charter involves change. Do a lot of listening, and find ways to align with people and pick their brain. Ask questions. And travel to meet remote people you need to work with, in person, with an agenda. The Compensation/Benefits are good. Some positions and in some teams you need to be politically adept. The culture in many teams is not exactly friendly, especially if some external perceptions of the team are negative - it can feel a bit paranoid.

There is little to no room for advancement, and little support for you to grow in your technical knowledge. If you come in from a background as a Linux Admin, or Network Engineer, you will gain little in this job and your skills will not be put to use.

The job was great overall and each day was enjoyable working with the other people.
The culture left something to be desired as the information was kept amongst certain people.
Management was very intimidating as they only shared certain information with their favorites.

4.0,Contractor,"As a contractor I worked at Mountain View and also on the YouTube Ads project in San Bruno.

The former was excellent, with an excellent supervisor. The contract was supposed to last one year and went two. Very happy.
I learned much from the other programmers and engineers (both Google employees and fellow contractors). The ergonomics of my desk and chair were excellent. The lighting is a bit harsh and the air quality was terrible on the weekends. I am used to an office and it was really weird sitting across from someone and when you looked up they might be staring back. Just weird!

Now, that was the good one. Following that, I worked in San Bruno on the YouTube Red project. It was extremely annoying and we were treated poorly. At YouTube our supervisor was terrible. I can honestly say she was the worst manager I've ever worked for. Blamed us for her lack of procedure and disorganization. Instead of real coding (and Graphics as promised) we spent our days and sometimes nights trying to modify an often broken and bizarre script-based system. We couldn't even get access to fix the broken parts! Super annoying.

I would work in Mountain View in a heartbeat. San Bruno and YouTube - never again. Stay away if you cherish your mental health.

Finally, a bit of a warning, for older engineers and contractors: expect to be left out of the culture. If you have a thin skin this might bug you. I didn't bother me much though and now and again, at Mountain View, I was often invited to events by my supervisor that really weren't supposed to be for contractors.",,,Senior Software Developer,Former Employee,"Mountain View, CA","September 18, 2018"

1.0,"Long working hours, on the upside, great on your resume","I had my first job out of college here, and even though the offices are amazing, with all the perks you could ever want or expect, you work so much that this is basically no need for it, as me and most people in my team were working closer to 50-60 hours a lot of weeks than the 45 originally suggested in the contract.

I feel that Google, at least in Dublin has a unhealthy culture. This is down to the expectation of working large amounts of unpaid overtime, very sharp elbows and strange management styles. I feel that the overarching sentiment from management at least in my team was leadership by fear. It always also seemed very political, in the way that who you knew and how well you know them was always more important than what you actually did.

3.0,Fun job but could've been better,"A day at google as a store operator was very consistent, not much changed, I learned to move at a very fast pace (timing was everything), how to work in the warehouse field, packaging and shipment. There wasn't much management due to the fact, we all pretty much did the same thing, there was no one higher up than you can go too besides a lead and they knew just as much as the store operators did, maybe a little more. The workplace varied depending on what store you were stationed at for the day or week, which could change at any given day/time. The hardest part of the job was trying to meet our delivery window when orders were flowing in, basically like a rush hour, and not being able to communicate with a boss or someone who should be over the whole store operators, not just leads. I enjoyed traveling to different places, different stores, meeting lots of new people, at Google you never really knew who you were going to be working with for the day or if things changed from the day before or not.",,,Store Operator,Former Employee,"San Bruno, CA","August 23, 2018"

During my time at Google, i managed to learn different ways of working. for example working the same tasks but in different ways due to the difference in employees working there and how they get things done.There was no correct way to do things but rather finding a way that suited you to do things.
The culture within the workplace was an amazing experience. The different types of food on offer for breakfast lunch and dinner. The level of pressure wasn't like other workplaces. Although many tasks were required to get done.

5.0,Awesome company,"I didn't mind staying late there as long as I could catch the train (commuter) and getting in early was normal. Plus you can catch a really healthy and delicious breakfast.

Other than a bit of posturing from teammates mostly from Ivy schools at the beginning, everyone is respectful and friendly.

Engineering is a clear favorite in the company though management receive high compensation as well.

Meetings are frequent but brief. People are expected to do more than the standard. That's what the perks are for I believe. The environment is comfortable so try to outperform and bring in more value for their cost (your compensation).

If I had to be picky, the only cons I experienced were (coming from smaller companies) that even if you were proficient in another area, you often couldn't apply it because roles are more strictly defined at a large company such as Google. There are security and policy procedures that limit access.

I read elsewhere that some people found some employees to be arrogant. I found that to be the rare minority. Even in those cases, if you prove yourself good at what you do, you win respect. When I started, I came from a state college and 80% of my team were Harvard grads. They did their clique-y thing on occasion. But they didn't realize I went to state university because my family wasn't well off, and I dropped my GPA at the end pursuing athletic and gaming competitions on a national level.

3.0,It can be tough to be a temp staff,"While it's great to have access to a Google office and work alongside Googlers, it can be painful to be reminded that you're a 'lesser' employee when office announcements often contain 'for FTES* only'.

However, Google is a big company; each team can be very different with each other so one's experience can depend on one's team. After a restructuring, my team's new management is horrible to us, temps. Due to large volumes of turnover, our most senior manager finally met us personally with apologies and promises to fix things.

Lo and behold, we all were served with a layoff notice via email a few weeks ago because the management has turned the team's model into that of vendors so all the temps will be out by the end of the year. We weren't warned before this and when people voiced out their anxiety with the aforementioned manager, she was taken aback and surprised with our reaction as she thought the news wasn't a big deal and >6 months of notice is more than sufficient. Such is the lack of empathy and connection between temps and the highest management of my team. Fyi, all the improvement measures would be thrown out the window with this change as well.

5.0,Contractor's POV,"As a contractor and not an employee, it was clear that becoming an employee depended in being able to fit with the clique - meaning having the right combination of education and alumni connections. Team members that were employees were sometimes snobbish, but there are jerks in all companies. Managers were generally helpful and clear with what they expected as work output.

4.0,Contract at Google,"I worked as a contractor for 2 years at Google, and overall it was a positive experience. The culture and benefits of being onsite were incredible, but being a contractor had a lot of downsides. I performed at a high level and they chose not to convert me (or many of my coworkers) to FT status because they preferred to hire people fresh out of Ivy League schools. With the culture of companies moving away from this model (and with how broken the university system is in general), I was surprised to see Google wasn't at the forefront of hiring people based on talent and not based on where they went to school.",Free food and transpotation to work,a lot expected from you and no promise of extension or reward for your work,Recruiting Coordinator (Contract),Former Employee,"Mountain View, CA","April 23, 2018"
5.0,One of the best working experiences every.,"Google was a wonderful place to work at. A typical day consisted of reviewing on going bugs and delivering ways to fix them, as well as committing change lists to improve any systems/applications that were launched in Borg. I learned a lot on how Google executes business practices in fluid and collaborative ways without getting bogged down in paperwork. The Management Team is highly technical, they could provide feedback for challenging solutions and guidance on how to wrangle them. Google's workplace culture is collaborative but highly competitive, you always need to bring you ""A"" game on a daily basis. The hardest part of the job was trying to manage work life, as the demands for getting projects completed on time were paramount.
