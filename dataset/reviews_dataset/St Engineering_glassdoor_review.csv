101,3.0,It is great for beginners,"The Environment here is friendly, and depending on your department, you are free to express your ideas.

The design work here is pretty interesting.

Work-life balance is reasonable, if you're not on a hot project.

As compared to an SME:
- They don't nitpick on why you are taking leave. My previous employer would 
 demand why I was taking leave.
- Depending on who you are under, the management is professional enough.","Based on what I observed:
1. Loss of capabilities
I put this first, because you might not read the rest. 

To an outsider, or fresh grad, you might think that ST is the place to be, and you're right, it is a good beginning. Though, it is not an ideal place to stay, and a lot of people with capabilities have already left the company. 

Not enough people are staying behind, to develop their engineering skills and knowledge, to nurture future generations. In short, the knowledge you seek, it is more-or-less no longer there, or you have to do some thorough digging.

Basically, whatever you try and make, you have to start from ground zero, which is not that bad, because of the environment here, friendly for beginners.

2. Salary is below market rate.
Salary is determined by Corporate HR, whose answer will be ""it is comparable across all ST Engineering"", note that it doesn't say market, and even if it does, they adjust it when:
- the market is bad for employees
- and they compare it across SMEs, so technically, they are right.
- and if you want to say that it is market rate? Over half a thousand reviews here say otherwise.

Your pay can easily be about 10% below market rate at the start (2 years), and as it progresses through the years, this number goes up to 20% at your 4th year, and 50%, after a period of around 10 years. Not a good thing if you're intending to BTO. 

Based on my observations, your salary is based on the following:
- Your class of honours
- Your relevant experience 
 - includes relevant Army Experience, which we will get to later), 
 - subject to HR's Consideration (more often than not, it's a ""sorry, your
 experience is irrelevant, and therefore, we shall judge you based on your
 honours as a fresh grad)
- Whether you are a scholar or not.

3. Salary is bad, for a niche industry.
You're working for the military industry of Singapore, 

under a private company not under the government, 

which is actively blocked by the government in the interests of national defense, and 

which is squeezed by the government when it comes to budgets (i.e. you have to be more-or-less the cheapest solution to win the bid against competitors from other countries). 

While other countries have their governments actively support their military companies (try Korea, China, the US, Israel?), this is not the case for Singapore. 

4. Increment is bad.
It's about 3%, and that is if you perform well. If you don't, you cannot even beat inflation. 

Heeey you wanna know how the determined if you perform well? Bell curve. At least, that's what I inferred. So... Add in scholars to the bell curve? You can make it such that the scholars get a more ""fair"" grading. Because they are scholars, an are an investment with utility to be maximised.

5. The SAF Effect.
They parachute people in, and I can see why, for the sake of national interests. Though, by observation, they tend to have this mentality:
- They are the king.
- They are only here temporarily, so there's no need to have that forward-looking vision. I'm talking like, 1 decade later vision.
Thing is, the SAF is an iron rice bowl - nothing too terrible (I'm talking retrenchment) happens unless you screw up bad. They aren't pressured to do particularly well, and that is bad for the company, imo.

6. Politics
Depending on your department, the politics is disgusting. Ever seen one of those videos of an infected wound with maggots in it? The maggots continue eating into the wound, and it worsens. It's that disgusting, from the average person's POV.",Engineer,Current Employee,"Jurong West New Town, ","Jul 6, 2021"
