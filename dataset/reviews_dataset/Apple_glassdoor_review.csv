If they REALLY cared about employee work/life balance,  they could bring aboard the right number of folks to make that issue dissolve.   Sick of hearing the lies.   Just don't lie about wanting to fix it,  when they clearly DON'T care",Anonymous Employee,Current Employee,,"Aug 28, 2014"
2,5.0,At-Home-Advisor,"The position is at home. The company is AMAZING. There are limitless advancement opportunities. You work with some very cool people and the leadership cares about your development. You may get coaching but you never get battered or belittled. The pay is decent and the benefits include, 401(k) match, stock purchase options, product discounts and discounts on services across many different areas, education assistance, child care assistance, paid vacation, sick time and other time off options, health club Reimbursment or bike cost set off. You get 1.5 time for OT and it's pretty much unlimited as long as you don't exceed 12 hours in a day or 59 total in a week.",The schedule changes every 90 days and you have to bid for your shifts so you never know what you are going to get.

3,5.0,Changing the world (in a small way),"Working at Apple means that the things you work on get into the hands of hundreds of millions of people, literally. It's a lot of pressure to get things right and drives one to do the best work of their lives. 2+ years later I'm still blown away by the talent and creativity of people I work with.","It's a lot of work, teams are usually strapped for resources and under pressure to deliver on strict timelines leading to high stress and long hours at certain times during the year.",Software Engineer IV,Current Employee,"Cupertino, CA","Jan 22, 2016"

5,5.0,Very well run company. Excellent career growth.,Very good pay and benefits. Management genuinely appreciates good work done. They provide good compensation raises and bonuses to keep you. Leave credits to you fairly. And the stock appreciation does give you some good upside. The employee purchase plan (EPP) is good. Plus they have EPP+ which gives extra money for purchases every three years. The company buys and uses some of the best software packages from vendors and so you are enabled to do a very high quality work using the best software there is.,Very hectic work life. My group has a requirement that nobody can take more time off than 2 weeks at a stretch. But now with remote work arrangements you can work from remote geographies for up to 4 weeks a year and can combine it with vacations. This policy is generally working out well enough so far. The ESPP policy limits you to no more than 10% of your salary to be invested. No matching rewards on ESPP. But the stock appreciation and stability of the stock price probably make up for it.,CAD Engineer - ICT IV,Current Employe,,"Mar 10, 2023"
6,4.0,Apple Retail,"- organized, structured, and corporatey: instruction manuals for literally every task, and clear order of operations for every single interaction you had. This made the job easy, if monotonous, for people who do well with structure, and frustratingly rigid for those who didn't enjoy structure/rules. 

- benefits were really what made it worthwhile to work there: great stock options, discounts on apple products, industry discounts on phone service plans","- poor scheduling practices: lead to inflexibility and inequality of hours and times 

- poor management and leadership: led to petty store politics, cliques, and favoritism. Often did not feel supported by management, and resorted to working with heads of department or coworkers for problems that management could have handled easily. 

- pay and raises: incredibly frustrating pay system. Salary was based on a rigid formula of performance, position, cost of labor (not cost of living) in your area, and the salary you started with. There was no nuance or humanity or sensibility to the way employees were paid. It was all up to the pay formula equation. So for example, store transfers and new hires would frequently make 20%–40% more per hour than employees with the same job who had been working at the store for many years, because their starting salary was higher (whether from starting in a location with a higher cost of labor, or starting more recently after a minimum wage had increased). Managers and leaders seemed to have their hands tied when it came to fixing this.",Operations Specialist,Former Employee,,"Feb 26, 2023"
7,4.0,It's Cool if you want a Job or just starting your career.,"Positive environment, promotes healthy communication, company culture is welcoming, safe, and fun. Apple definitely changes your approach to life and encourages you to slow down and seek understanding, accept people as the unique individual they are, embrace ambiguity, and seeing opportunity in rejection, redirection, or undesired outcomes.","While the culture is generally positive there is some micro passive aggression that occurs and the bigger picture usually loses the vote to low hanging fruit. The business team's ceiling is fairly low. There are two roles, Business Expert and Business Pro which are pretty easy to promote through in a couple of years but after Pro there are no next steps in store for Business team members. Getting to corporate is definitely possible but requires a longer journey. Current economic situation does not help either. Internal processes lack structure as well.",Business Pro,Current Employee,,"Mar 13, 2023"
8,3.0,Manage your expectations,"Great Benefits - health account, education account, discounted company stocks and products. Well-developed company systems protect employees from being easily fired based on a manager's personal preferences Company wide activities and resources make me feel they really care about employees’ well being.","Apple's culture of secrecy has been exploited by many managers with ulterior motives. They are usually people who have worked at Apple for a long time, but somehow feel deeply insecure and need to defend their turf/vested interest in Apple. They exclude new people from important team tasks, they don't give team members any exposure, they only use you for a small part of the project and don't let you participate the whole process - as if more capable people join, they lose the limelight . Worst of all, some managers go out of their way to belittle the efforts and strengths of others, they claim credit for others' work. They tend to hire someone with 10 + years of experience to do an intern job, which they feel is normal at Apple as they boast that they only hire the best talent in the market. Some managers are living against the company culture of Diversity and Inclusion. There are many contractors and temporary employees working for the company and are NOT well-treated, often, in a unspoken and hidden way.",Project Manager,Current Employe,,"Mar 23, 2023"
9,3.0,Toxic Management,Benefits are great and job opportunities with certifications are unlimited.,"The values and principles laid out in the credo are often disregarded at our store, except when it comes to achieving specific goals such as trade-ins and iPhone activations. The work environment is toxic, with management exhibiting an authoritarian and micromanaging culture. Peer colleagues are not receptive to constructive feedback, and there is a lack of training and guidance for technicians and sales specialists. It's difficult to see any opportunities for growth within the company. Speaking up can result in ruthless retaliation from management, and there is a pattern of gaslighting employees. There is also a lack of emotional intelligence from management, with a few displaying narcissistic tendencies and racist priorities. Employees are forced to deal with emotional abuse from their colleagues, especially in-store meetings with the store leader at Apple Memorial City in Houston, Texas. Management actively discourages employees from creating a union, and the market team does not have a meaningful way for employees to advocate for themselves in the face of such poor treatment.

This company will eat your soul and spit it back at you, at least in hardware engineering. Management collectively uses fear and shame-based motivation. Team members are expected to present frequently to large groups with lots of shame and hostility toward people who either do not have certain expected tasks complete, have not made proper judgment calls, do not have the full depth of analysis that is expected, etc even when one is burning themselves out working over 65 hrs a weak to try to keep up. As a DRI (directly responsible individual) you own everything and are expected to do everything, even though management may tell you that ""some things can fall through the cracks"". When you complain about ""quality of life"", they pretend to hear you, but will immediately try to convince you that you are wrong. The management actively gas-lights people when they complain, contributing the lack of time or bandwidth that one has to their own time management issues. Working here is like actively living in an insane asylum. There is no social life, it's just awkward, no one is encouraged to talk or socialize, just to get your work done. Pay is the only thing that keeps people here. For several years I have worked until 11-p or as late as 4am consistently for 4 days a weak, Fridays ending early sometimes as early as 6pm. I've seen people with children do this years on end, they have no life. The question is why? Is your true sense of self value derived so deeply from this work? It probably shouldn't be.

- great salary (especially for retail)

- lots of learning experiences and resources
- opportunity for advancement
- opportunities for ""career experiences"" in corporate roles, for retail staff (underutilized, apparently. go for it!)
- you become really good friends with your peer group, or maybe even family!
- Amazing sense of belonging and community
- great stepping stone to new career, if that is your choice","- Too much ""drinking the kool aid"". WAY too much. I hope this is an apt metaphor: Imagine you have an 8oz cup in your hand. They pour a 64oz pitcher of Kool-Aid into your 8oz. cup. Then they pour a pitcher of sugar into the same cup. You get diabetes. The amount of company propaganda is absolutely astounding and excessive to point of being absolutely ridiculous, wherein you feel like a caricature of yourself wearing this blue shirt. This is coming from me, a lifelong Apple fan since 1987 (the year I started using computers).
- FAR too much bashing of anything that isn't Apple. Apple has now decided as a company, to compare itself to Samsung and Google, etc etc. It used to decide not to compare itself to anybody. This shows everywhere from development to retail attitudes.
- Willing isolation from and ignorance of the rest of the world of technology. Apple exists in a bubble, and those within the bubble are blissfully unaware that any other technology is relevant and useful. I heard one employee say that Microsoft Office is going the way of the dinosaurs. Nobody called him out on this. What dream world is he living in???? Isn't it better to learn Apple's technology in a way that helps it workably coexist with other technology? This is equally as important as learning the Apple ecosystem, which, yes, in itself is amazing.
- Training is too general, not specific enough to help sharpen one's technical skill set on a consistent basis.
- No ongoing training program to keep your technical skills sharp and up to date. Instead, they offer ""Pathways"", which is meant to improve your social skills. Great! But isn't that why they hired us to begin with? You have to search Apple's technical reporting system for relevant known issues, which is fine but if you don't (and a lot of techs don't)  you usually find out what those are when a customer has a problem and you don't know the answer. One person who happened to look at iDesk might know the answer, but if they're not available, you may end up giving the customer the wrong solution. The signal to noise ratio of important, specific information is a total mess.
- ""I can't believe they re-arranged the lockers. I'm thinking about quitting now."" Everyone joins in agreement. Really, guys? C'mon. Again, as I mentioned in my point about the Apple ""bubble"", the perception of reality can be largely distorted. Management has to work REALLY REALLY hard to bend over backwards for every little thing. So how much energy do they have left over to make sure their techs are up to date, or that sales staff knows their specs and has good ways of explaining tech to non-tech people? Apple is very big on managing expectations for customers (great, actually!) but could do a lot better to manage expectations for employees. Maybe this would improve management's time and ability to fix some more important issues.
- Far too many points of contact for customers. A customer may end up talking to between 4 and 8 different people who may end up telling them lots of conflicting things. Either communication needs to improve in the store or the number of contact points needs to decrease somehow.",Family Room Specialist,Former Employee,"Stamford, CT","Sep 10, 2014"

- great work environment
- great salary (especially for retail)
- lots of peer support
- lots of management support
- lots of learning experiences and resources
- opportunity for advancement
- opportunities for ""career experiences"" in corporate roles, for retail staff (underutilized, apparently. go for it!)
- you become really good friends with your peer group, or maybe even family!
- Amazing sense of belonging and community
- great stepping stone to new career, if that is your choice","- Too much ""drinking the kool aid"". WAY too much. I hope this is an apt metaphor: Imagine you have an 8oz cup in your hand. They pour a 64oz pitcher of Kool-Aid into your 8oz. cup. Then they pour a pitcher of sugar into the same cup. You get diabetes. The amount of company propaganda is absolutely astounding and excessive to point of being absolutely ridiculous, wherein you feel like a caricature of yourself wearing this blue shirt. This is coming from me, a lifelong Apple fan since 1987 (the year I started using computers).
- FAR too much bashing of anything that isn't Apple. Apple has now decided as a company, to compare itself to Samsung and Google, etc etc. It used to decide not to compare itself to anybody. This shows everywhere from development to retail attitudes.
- Willing isolation from and ignorance of the rest of the world of technology. Apple exists in a bubble, and those within the bubble are blissfully unaware that any other technology is relevant and useful. I heard one employee say that Microsoft Office is going the way of the dinosaurs. Nobody called him out on this. What dream world is he living in???? Isn't it better to learn Apple's technology in a way that helps it workably coexist with other technology? This is equally as important as learning the Apple ecosystem, which, yes, in itself is amazing.
- Training is too general, not specific enough to help sharpen one's technical skill set on a consistent basis.
- No ongoing training program to keep your technical skills sharp and up to date. Instead, they offer ""Pathways"", which is meant to improve your social skills. Great! But isn't that why they hired us to begin with? You have to search Apple's technical reporting system for relevant known issues, which is fine but if you don't (and a lot of techs don't)  you usually find out what those are when a customer has a problem and you don't know the answer. One person who happened to look at iDesk might know the answer, but if they're not available, you may end up giving the customer the wrong solution. The signal to noise ratio of important, specific information is a total mess.
- ""I can't believe they re-arranged the lockers. I'm thinking about quitting now."" Everyone joins in agreement. Really, guys? C'mon. Again, as I mentioned in my point about the Apple ""bubble"", the perception of reality can be largely distorted. Management has to work REALLY REALLY hard to bend over backwards for every little thing. So how much energy do they have left over to make sure their techs are up to date, or that sales staff knows their specs and has good ways of explaining tech to non-tech people? Apple is very big on managing expectations for customers (great, actually!) but could do a lot better to manage expectations for employees. Maybe this would improve management's time and ability to fix some more important issues.
- Far too many points of contact for customers. A customer may end up talking to between 4 and 8 different people who may end up telling them lots of conflicting things. Either communication needs to improve in the store or the number of contact points needs to decrease somehow.",Family Room Specialist,Former Employee,"Stamford, CT","Sep 10, 2014"

533,3.0,Temporary Job At Best,The pay is just enough to keep you from leaving.  Clean environment.  Plenty of training in your respective role (if requested).  The employee stock purchase program (ESPP) is the primary reason to stay employed.   ,"No advancement opportunities within retail.  If you become a genius there is a chance to land a corporate role, but the cost of living offsets the financial reasoning to move.  Many associates complain that they were working themselves to the bone but saving less than they did when in retail.  Managers are absolutely oblivious to their staff; self absorbed with their ambitions ferociously guided by their own career ambitions.  The management is daft, insincere, unhelpful in any regard, and absolutely metrics obsessed.  They only want to know about metrics os they have something to say to senior leaders to make themselves seem intelligent/productive, when in reality they just hide in the managers office throughout their shifts shifting all of their work onto Leads and other team members.  There is no access to sunlight within the building and the air quality is rancid due to all of the people being isolated within the store (no windows, only one large entry door where guests enter).  Seniority puts you at a higher risk of termination because Management wants to save on payroll.  Managers have no respect for individual associates; only team metrics.  Company culture is dissolving faster than that raccoon trying to wash his cotton candy.  ",Operations Associate,Former Employe,,"May 24, 2022"

The employee stock purchase program (ESPP) is the primary reason to stay employed.   ,"No advancement opportunities within retail.  If you become a genius there is a chance to land a corporate role, but the cost of living offsets the financial reasoning to move.  Many associates complain that they were working themselves to the bone but saving less than they did when in retail.  Managers are absolutely oblivious to their staff; self absorbed with their ambitions ferociously guided by their own career ambitions.  The management is daft, insincere, unhelpful in any regard, and absolutely metrics obsessed.  They only want to know about metrics os they have something to say to senior leaders to make themselves seem intelligent/productive, when in reality they just hide in the managers office throughout their shifts shifting all of their work onto Leads and other team members.  There is no access to sunlight within the building and the air quality is rancid due to all of the people being isolated within the store (no windows, only one large entry door where guests enter).  Seniority puts you at a higher risk of termination because Management wants to save on payroll.  Managers have no respect for individual associates; only team metrics.

It was a very competitive field, even if it didn’t seem like it. There were a lot of associates giving back handed compliments, cherry picking customer sales, and even doing sexual favors to stay high on the score card. A LOT of associates were unhappy with how things were being done and all they did was stress about this scorecard, even outside of work. Associates felt like they couldn’t give feedback on how they were being treated because at any moment you could be pulled aside and told ‘your not doing too well on the scorecard’ and suddenly higher ups are keeping a more watchful eye on you than they should. When dealing with sale issues, They try to make it seem like they’re on your side when you need help with something and you should of “gone to them sooner”, yet you went to several leads/experts before with issues and yet they still look at you like you don’t know what you’re doing somehow?

1039,5.0,One of the best Silicon Valleys at present,"Apple currently offers competitive salaries and benefits, interesting projects, smart colleagues and a comfortable workplace.

Of note is Apple's contribution to the 401(k) plan.  For the first two years, the maximum matching contribution is 3%, but increases to 4.5% after two years of tenure and to 6% after fives years of tenure.  Other employers such as Oracle and (before the Oracle acquisition) Sun offered only a 3% maximum matching contribution.  And the Apple matching contribution vests immediately, unlike for example HP where the matching contribution vests only after three long years; incredibly, HP will confiscate its matching contribution if you leave HP for any reason prior to three years.  Apple won't.

Also, Apple's medical insurance is top-notch, easily besting for example the medical insurance of HP.  With HP's lowest-deductible health plan, a $3,000 MRI will cost you $750 out of pocket ($500 deductible plus 10% of $3,000 less the $500 deductible) whereas with Apple the MRI will cost you nothing out of pocket.  Apple's medical insurance is among the best that I've seen in Silicon Valley, and rivals that of Oracle and Sun.","My only complaint is that Apple is hiring so rapidly into my department that we all have to share an office with another employee.

Leave generous for US companies even if it’s a bit behind some direct competitors.,"Compensation is a sore point for every single person on my team and for everyone I talk to on other teams. Business claims to pay the competitive market rate but as people leave in droves we learn they find much higher pay for similar roles across the board elsewhere in the same city. More and more outsourcing taking place to save on paying employees a living wage. A recent “generous” attempt to raise wages and appease people managed to go lower than total inflation this year so was effectively a pay decrease in terms of purchasing power for most people. 

HR plus the outsourced business that does all the paperwork seems to be designed to help Apple rather than the employee. Heard dozens of sad and frustrating first hand experiences from direct co workers about being ignored or made to fill out complex paperwork to het help. I’ve witnessed a few (but not all) managers being confrontational and unprofessional. The public image is far removed from the extremely negative vibe in office exacerbated by the snails pace that the business has in addressing any of this, often with people forgetting all about things before a resolution . 

Offices are colorless, lifeless, dystopian grey/white/silver with a splash of “art” of a phone or computer product here and there, so it makes a fairly miserable place to spend time in. Outside is much nicer but the heat is too much to be out there a lot and there is very limited shade for outdoor seating.

I feel respected and work with respectful people.","Rarity of opportunities, takes the lead. 

Working in Retail, unfortunately, and saddens me to say, is completely difficult to connect to corporate roles. Even with a bachelors, it’s extremely difficult, if not impossible, to enter into their job market, unless, perhaps, you’re majoring in engineering. 

My advice is to apply to corporate internships, and trying to land a job that way. The great thing, to not discourage yourself if you’re reading this, is that retail employees can apply to corporate internships. That’s honestly your best bet to try and enter, but keep in mind, like all risk, it won’t be a guarantee. 

All in all, a lack of opportunity outside of sales and repairs is heartbreaking, especially since many people and students have tremendously amount to offer, if only they are given a chance. There’s frankly nothing else for people to grow in, unless you can get into customer service remote jobs.

There are too many things that have built up over the years to even mention. 
That said, the largest issue facing employment and customer product and experience is the extremely biased and racist hiring. In the name of inclusion and equality they have become the polar opposite.

Apple does a good job of setting you up with ibuddies, who become your mentors that guide you through onboarding, and answer any questions. My ibuddy was wonderful, transparent and honest about the downfalls of Apple.","I've worked at 4 other tech companies and each of those have been a better experience than Apple. The benefits, the work environment, the culture and especially the work life balance.

Apple has started requiring employees to go onsite to the office 3 times a week. Although I'm grateful for a hybrid model and to have a job, I think employees should have more say over when they go to the office, especially when covid is still prevalent and other diseases are surfacing. The pandemic has provided us the opportunity to better balance our lives and Apple doesn't seem to be understanding of this. 

I envy all the appreciation posts on LI of people at companies that allow them more flexibility and understanding when it comes to work life balance. I believe that as long as you're meeting deadlines, contributing to your team and doing impactful work, it doesn't matter how or where you do it. Apple needs to trust their employees more. 

The benefits are alright. The cafeteria food is marked down by maybe 10% and isn't very good so we often get lunch from the Whole Foods hot bar. If you're requiring us to go into the office, at least provide a convenient and more cost effective lunch option. 

The culture feels a bit negative. Many employees talk trash about other companies as if everyone is the enemy. This was off-putting when I first joined and during my first 1:1 meetings with multiple people including my own manager, my previous company became a topic for slander. Competition doesn't have to be nasty.

Many of my former coworkers who was not afraid of making the jump, end up leaving for MUCH better jobs with much better pay, and with employers who value them more than Apple did.

Leave generous for US companies even if it’s a bit behind some direct competitors.,"Compensation is a sore point for every single person on my team and for everyone I talk to on other teams. Business claims to pay the competitive market rate but as people leave in droves we learn they find much higher pay for similar roles across the board elsewhere in the same city. More and more outsourcing taking place to save on paying employees a living wage. A recent “generous” attempt to raise wages and appease people managed to go lower than total inflation this year so was effectively a pay decrease in terms of purchasing power for most people. 

HR plus the outsourced business that does all the paperwork seems to be designed to help Apple rather than the employee. Heard dozens of sad and frustrating first hand experiences from direct co workers about being ignored or made to fill out complex paperwork to het help. I’ve witnessed a few (but not all) managers being confrontational and unprofessional. The public image is far removed from the extremely negative vibe in office exacerbated by the snails pace that the business has in addressing any of this, often with people forgetting all about things before a resolution . 

Offices are colorless, lifeless, dystopian grey/white/silver with a splash of “art” of a phone or computer product here and there, so it makes a fairly miserable place to spend time in. Outside is much nicer but the heat is too much to be out there a lot and there is very limited shade for outdoor seating.

- Cool work","- Non-existing work-life balance. This is not an exaggeration. People will email well beyond appropriate business hours, ping, text, email like they text. Weekend and late night work is expected.

I have not had a weekend in a month. I did not get Memorial Day off, I had to skip Mother’s Day, I already know I will be expected to work Labor Day. What is the price of your time and life?

- Most execs and leads are men. My team is most female, on the ground level, while all leads are men.

I came from Google. It was an extremely tough decision to make. The creative is stronger here; there is no arguing that. That’s why I came. In comparison to Google, who also has peak moments of large work volume, my experience has been that Apple does not consider the cost and considerations of pushing for more work.

1735,2.0,Drink the Kool-Aid or be disappointed,"- Apple on your resume, which means something to a lot of people.
- The pay is exceptional for advertising, even if your pay will never match what an Apple engineer earns. Tech just pays better, but Apple's marketing department doesn't pay better than its FAANG competitors.","- Success comes from being political -- that's it. The most talented folks are in the IC ranks. Shockingly few people at the management level are good at their core creative function, yet wield exceptional power to shape the org's creative output and their subordinates' careers. Whole marketing org is a snake pit.
- The organization is designed so that the best people and ideas get whitewashed before they can ever rise to the top. Extremely talented employees walk out the door every day and never come back because the org doesn't know how to prioritize talent -- and it never will, since the org believes mostly correctly that Apple can command top-tier talent at all times
- The secrecy is toxic. Employees (including leadership) have been known to ""disappear"" (get terminated) without explanation, likely because explanation would required acknowledgement of their wrongdoing, and Apple will stop at nothing to protect its reputation. There's always some internal investigation or another going on, with employee relations and HR conspiring to discover which employees know XYZ person did something awful rather than simply getting rid of the bad -ehem- apple. 
- The arrogance that the public has long associated with the Apple brand is very much a part of the internal ""culture"" too. The program is written by wealthy, out-of-touch elites of a certain shade, and you can get with it or get out. You'll get very little for ""free"" at the Apple campus except the occasional bagel and basic office supplies. HR once tried to lure people back into the office on the promise of fridges stocked with free bread and peanut butter. The company throws kindergarten snacks at its employees and demands gratitude.
- Speaking of gratitude, far too many managers insist that employees -- particularly women and minorities -- simply be grateful for having the privilege of working at Apple. 
- Half the workforce has been brainwashed by the Apple juice, and the other half is too desperate and scared to vocalize an independent thought.
- Company is deeply conservative, while somehow also being apolitical? The leader of the marketing department excitedly announced before the pandemic that employees would be allowed to work from home once a month. That was progress at Apple. 
- The company would watch everyone leave before relenting and allowing more flexibility, simply out of arrogance.",Copywriter,Current Employee,"Cupertino, CA","Jun 17, 2022"

-WORK LIFE BALANCE | It is nearly impossible to have a work life balance when you have a family and it is absolutely impossible to have one if you are a single parent. AppleCare will not move into the 21st century when it comes to flexible schedules.

-WORKLOAD | AppleCare senior advisors have a large workload which would not be a problem if they were compensated accordingly 

-ENVIRONMENT | AppleCare has a toxic an environment when it comes to employee moral and the overall mental wellbeing for employees.

There are too many things that have built up over the years to even mention. 
That said, the largest issue facing employment and customer product and experience is the extremely biased and racist hiring. In the name of inclusion and equality they have become the polar opposite.

-Room to really grow and work your way up in the retail space. Getting promoted/role change is hard work but would pay off well for those looking to lead their team. Many options available for those looking for a career experience at the corporate level after being successful in your current role.

-Great loyalty to and from their employees, although sometimes this means we just 'do whatever corporate thinks we should'. During store closures amid the pandemic apple had all of us work our full hours remotely on collaboration and individual and group projects, great to see them take care of us like that compared to many other retail spaces.

-Genuine joy from helping others often at no cost (depending on hardware/software issue) and repairing trust in Apple's products and services. A personal passion of mine.

-Some new minor benefits and lower schedule requirements for employees coming soon (mostly in response to work life balance issues, see below).","-Overall direction of new leadership and management. Prioritization of metrics and statistics. Although these stats were always important (they are factored in to determine pay increases), I've noticed newer leadership change how they treat different employees over small changes or minor trends in sales metrics (Applecare,trade-in, accessories,connected).

-Work-life balance is not well for a full-time role. Hours are long and can be tedious, working long is expected and rewarded. For college students, I would've recommended a part time role, but even then the schedule inconsistency and still high commitment would only be for those who can effectively balance the two as equal. I was burnt out and ready for something new after about 2-1/2 years, many will stay for years, some decades.

-You are taught that the Apple experience is about doing what's right for the customer, within the boundaries of what's possible for the company. Often, even a straightforward and legitimate solution (the one our service guide recommends) involves jumping through many hoops to get the customer,leadership,and system to all agree. As a starting specialist, you are the professional hoops jumper, especially at the genius bar.

-Consistent issues with in-store software and hardware, internal tools and services going down, loss of written notes and repair details. Service blackouts are usually minutes but can sometimes last for hours. Daily re-write ups of unsaved repairs or broken repair chains. Extreme lack of production due to these problems, usually amplified by the higher amount of customers we saw at our smaller and less employed store.

Slight anti-union attitude, but no outright call against them. We saw other large stores in cities unionize, I know some of my fellow employees weren't opposed to the idea given the dissent from work-life balance.",Technical Specialist,Former Employee,,"Jul 7, 2022"

Apple does a good job of setting you up with ibuddies, who become your mentors that guide you through onboarding, and answer any questions. My ibuddy was wonderful, transparent and honest about the downfalls of Apple.","I've worked at 4 other tech companies and each of those have been a better experience than Apple. The benefits, the work environment, the culture and especially the work life balance.

Apple has started requiring employees to go onsite to the office 3 times a week. Although I'm grateful for a hybrid model and to have a job, I think employees should have more say over when they go to the office, especially when covid is still prevalent and other diseases are surfacing. The pandemic has provided us the opportunity to better balance our lives and Apple doesn't seem to be understanding of this. 

I envy all the appreciation posts on LI of people at companies that allow them more flexibility and understanding when it comes to work life balance. I believe that as long as you're meeting deadlines, contributing to your team and doing impactful work, it doesn't matter how or where you do it. Apple needs to trust their employees more. 

The benefits are alright. The cafeteria food is marked down by maybe 10% and isn't very good so we often get lunch from the Whole Foods hot bar. If you're requiring us to go into the office, at least provide a convenient and more cost effective lunch option. 

The culture feels a bit negative. Many employees talk trash about other companies as if everyone is the enemy. This was off-putting when I first joined and during my first 1:1 meetings with multiple people including my own manager, my previous company became a topic for slander. Competition doesn't have to be nasty.
