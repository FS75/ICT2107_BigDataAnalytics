1,3.0,Great place to start a career. Not good for long term.,Good place to start a career. There are many diverse and challenging problems to work on. Great engineers to work with and learn from.,"Initial training is relatively poor, approach is very sink-or-swim. They have worked hard to improve this over the years, and it has gotten better, but they need to focus more in this area. Very little upward mobility, unless you are part of the club. Management is out-of-touch and too focused on satisfying their bosses at the expense of their directs. DRAM is a commodity that goes through cycles. While upper management is obviously aware of this, they do little to protect the business from downcycles and overspend during upcycles. Layoffs often occur every 3-5 years as a result. Management pays a lot of lip service to innovation. However, they are only interested in innovation that is very specific to the product. Peripheral innovation is often ignored or disregarded. The culture focuses on a reactionary instead of proactive approach to engineering. Many future problems could be avoided by taking a proactive QC minded approach, but management is often not supportive. Forced poor performance scoring to meet a quota. A lot of good engineers have lost jobs as a result of playing number games. Vaccine mandate.",Senior Product Engineer,Former Employee,"Boise, ID","Mar 9, 2023"
2,1.0,Dont Join,"Good Immediate Colleagues, your experience might differ. Hybrid work atleast for now.","All words, when it really comes to implementation the Management fails hard. Find excuses to skip bonuses or promotions by C-suite. Severence package was bad compared to peers. Management decision led to merging our team with other team(which was for most part homogeneous, seemed like the sr dir hired his own people) led to the distruction of our diverse/open culture team(almost all of the previous team members noticed this and most left/transfered to other teams, in hindsight that was a good decision ).",Media Systems Engineer,Former Employe,,"Mar 24, 2023"
3,2.0,"Poor work-life balance, toxic company culture","Boise is a great place to work, and the semiconductor industry is very interesting.","Micron has a toxic company culture with bad work-life balance. The company is very internationally distributed now, so expect to work in both the US and Asia times zones simultaneously. This typically means 60 hours a week minimum. Additionally, the company culture is very cutthroat, and employees will frequently undercut and sabotage each other in order to protect their jobs. As a result, there is very little team cohesion and camaraderie.",Data Scientist,Former Employee,"Boise, ID","Mar 18, 2023"

6,3.0,"Not the worst, but the culture kinda sucks","Interesting technical problems, some really great engineers and people, Boise is a fairly nice city (especially if you bought your house awhile ago), a strong and experienced manager can make a huge difference protecting from much of the BS from above","Biggest problem here is that the company loves managers more than engineers. Much easier to climb the ladder and get more money by turning into a manager than by being a technically competent engineer who is respected by their peers. The company is filled with layers and layers of management. Another big problem is the current CEO’s very heavy-handed, top-down approach. Managers and directors often have little room to apply their own discretion. Stacked rankings and restrictive WFH policies are evidence. The reward loyalty with meager raises, at least in Boise. Corporate believes that people won’t uproot their lives by leaving Idaho to change jobs so they skimp on the perks.",Principal Engineer,Former Employe,,"Feb 10, 2023"
7,2.0,"Good benefits, performance management system sucks and the equity incentive system is a joke",The health insurance options and benefits are verry good. Lot of different opportunities to pursue interests within the company.,"The performance management system is based on rating workers based on a normal distribution. You could have instances where a management team has built a top notch team and they end up having to give lower ratings to higher performers in order to fit into the curve. Managers will end up making statements like ""well, a 4 rating was harder to achieve this year"". This means that what is required to meet or exceed expectations changes year to year, however they will not tell you what it takes to 'exceed expectations' any given year. The individual leader doesn't know how their team will fit into the over all distribution so they really can't give you meaningful feedback until after the distribution 'level setting' is done. Bonus pay is based on company goal achievement and the arbitrary rating system so the rating potential of impacting bonus pay drastically. The stock based incentive system is also an area that needs help. You have no clue or reference point as to how well you did in the distribution of stock awards. They don't share any data on target amounts or distributions. They are not tied to the performance ratings one year you may get none, the next year you might get hundreds or thousands. Not having a reference point makes the awards seem more like a lottery. Just stay friends with the manager in your team so you are sure to get something. Lastly missive layoffs happen and it is not just poor performers that get cut.

I remember taking some of the classes that are required for my current job, and it would be nice not having to do them again. I was recently diagnosed with Brest Cancer, and I have not completed required hours to qualify for FMLA. I know there are rules and sometimes they can't be changed, but life happens and there should be some exceptions.

31,2.0,Don't believe the company's stated values,"-Good pay (compared to academia) 

-Earnest coworkers 

-Good benefits 

-You're valued... if you're a design engineer and/or a manager","-Two of the five Micron Values are People and Tenacity, and the executives like to brag about how the company lives up to both. Yet after two years of record profits and one just year of market downturn, they started laying people off. They say they understand the cyclical nature of the semiconductor market, and claim that they have cash saved, yet they can't hold onto their workforce through a downturn? My team (onboarding) went from being the most critical one in my department to being gutted by layoffs. SO shortsighted. 

-The company's mission statement is ""delivering technology that is transforming how the world uses information to enrich life for all,"" and its executives love to brag about the beneficial uses of Micron's memory and storage products. Yet when asked about the company's ethical position on the evil uses of those products -- particularly general artificial intelligence and mass surveillance -- the execs had no answers whatsoever. So they really don't have an ethical position on the devices they put into the world. 

-Endless layers of middle management make it impossible to reason with decision-makers over policy and very slow to get anything done. 

-Outdated philosophies about working onsite. My department went fully remote from 2020-21, and most of us were happier; but as soon as COVID restrictions eased, we were sent back onsite. They made some half-hearted attempts at a hybrid schedule, but ultimately couldn't let go of the ""put your butt in your cubicle"" ideology. 

-Significant, unacknowledged caste system. I started as a contractor, and though I was told that I was just as important as Micron Team Members, I was not allowed to access the onsite gym or buy a discounted lunch like they were. Later, when my team was sent back onsite after working from home through COVID, I discovered that there are dozens of Micron workers that have permanent home offices. But when I asked for the same arrangement, I was told that I didn't have ""a rare and special skill set"" like those people. So I wasn't valuable enough to deserve a home office.

To make things worse, Micron has adopted a forced-ranking performance management system that forces managers to use the full distribution of ratings (1 through 5) during yearly performance reviews. This is like the old GE system of terminating 10% of the workforce every year to create turnover.

They seek to be helpful, while also allowing me to answer questions on my own. They, and all the supervisors and managers, never talk down to me or treat me as though I am on a lower level. - You actually feel connected to the CEO and VPs and all other managers! Large Zoom meetings with these company leaders are a frequent occurrence, and they never talk down to us. They are always optimistic and encouraging. Despite how large the company is, I really feel like I know the leaders well. - The benefits and compensation are extremely generous and too numerous to name, but here are a few: free physical checkups annually, a Health Savings Account, generous 401(k) options, an on-site cafeteria that provides discount meals, an onsite gym, a team-building budget for every team, the option to work from home if that is preferred, move-in assistance from a professional realtor, and many other benefits! Overall, I've loved working here at Micron! It's given me so many opportunities to grow and expand my talents.","- I was hired in the latter half of 2022, and the COVID-19 policy of Micron seemed far too restrictive and unscientific. Before being hired, I had to provide proof of vaccination. Despite being vaccinated, however, all employees were required to fill out a daily health survey, describing how we felt that day as well as other details. This daily survey, in addition to mandatory testing twice a week and masking when walking throughout the workplace, was an inconvenience that made the workplace less enjoyable. Please note: this policy is NO LONGER in place at Micron, being removed about a month after my hire, but it could possibly happen again in the case of another spike in COVID-19 or any other health situation deemed an emergency. Overall, this policy did not appear to respect the individual agency of thousands of bright, logical engineers who are capable of making well-informed decisions themselves, and it seemed to be more about signaling to the world how ""safe"" we were during the pandemic. - Particularly noticeable at the beginning of my hire (during the introductory trainings) was the company's focus on diversity.

Also they have some of the smartest engineers working in the R&D facility.,"Well the senior leadership is useless. They have botched every opportunity they have got to get ahead in the industry. One of the major downsides to working at Micron is that it is such a large company and projects take a lifetime to get through the pipeline and for us Engineers to actually do some work on new stuff. There is too much bureaucracy. Another thing is that there are too many things going on at one time for a manager to keep track of every project. And when some project gets over, turns out we never really needed to do that project as some one else throughout the company in some little cubicle was already using that utility for his team. The IT teams are spread too thin and each one is doing their own thing.

The benefits are also pretty good, but the rumor is that they may be changing.","The company now has an outsourcing fetish and have the belief that everyone who is a ""doer"" should have their job outsourced, preferably overseas.   As a technical person, don't expect any type of meaningful career from this company in the future.   Career advancement to management is very limited because all of the positions are occupied by ""good ole boys"" who've been in those positions for 15+ years.  The outsourcing and recent cost-cutting also means that an increasing share of the software work not sent overseas involves maintaining old code bases, most of which are in poor shape because historically the company has paid little attention to software quality.  The company is also now obsessed with being ""low-cost"" and this is increasingly reflected in the quality of the workforce here.

Don't expect to make any money with this company's stock either.  For an explanation, look at this company's stock chart since 2000.

There are always opportunities to excel in your area as long as you are open minded and don't mind working overtime in order to complete extra projects.

The Boise team members in general are very dedicated and go out of their way to be helpful. 

The recent trend with more flexible working hours and location is convenient. 

Some of the changes that have taken place with Sanjay have been progressive and good for Micron.",".
 All recent management hires I think except one have been VPs from Sandisc  or Western Digital who are from India and male.

The diversity and inclusion they advertise is more on the surface and club like,  it doesn’t mean there is a program to even out women in the higher level leadership positions or even identify those who would like to be. The good ole boys club is still in force unfortunately. It’s just a different nationality now. 

There is still dedicated mid level senior managers talent at Micron excited about many of the new changes but not empowered while directors and above are just frankly not managing their teams. 

This is a global company. Most jobs may require working evenings as we have Asia manufacturing sites. Be prepared. It’s expected. The unexpected part is that the organizations do not have process for justifying new headcount and many organizations run too lean. If that is the case you either have no work life balance because your work load is too much or you feel bad because you can never do as much as you would like to do. 

Top senior talent is leaving and the current leadership does not seem to have any concerns and in fact is creating policies that encourage that. The hiring strategy is one dimensional and seems short sighted to only hire new grads. But as we lose the senior level experience, who will train these new grads and how many excursions will Micron accept due to lack of senior talent and so many in training?

Very limited ability to work from home and overall WFH has a negative perception when it comes to promotions or abilities.  

There is a trust issue between management and non-management team members.  

Management has difficulty monitoring employees based on productivity, and instead uses the ""onsite badge report"" which shows when you're actually working from a Micron facility.  If you're working from home, that is seen as welcome but not part of your 40 hour work week, and in reality Micron really wants more hours from any non-management employee than could be ever possible.    

There are more process responsibilities assigned to team members than could ever be followed (at least while still keeping productive on real work), and policies are written for the lowest productive employees instead of the higher performers.  There is always too much work in the pipeline than feasible, and it's more of a ""yes-man"" oriented culture than one that makes decisions based on hard numbers.

302,1.0,Wouldn't recommend unless you have no other options,"- The pay is about average for the industry, which translates into good compensation if you're in a low cost area like Boise. If you're in a high-cost area, the salaries aren't as competitive.
- There are some truly good people working hard in the trenches to make a difference. These front-line folks keep the business running. Can't say the same for most of the upper management team.
- In good years, the bonus structure is fairly generous (although it's a pittance compared to the $1 Million+ productivity per worker the company has been able to achieve) 
- There is some flexibility in work environment, with things like work-from-home becoming more common.
- Benefits are fairly good, but would it could do with a much improved dental plan, a sabbatical program, and job swapping programs to give team members more visibility to other areas of the company.
- Some management chains are superb, and I'm fortunate to work in one of those organizations. Unfortunately, these are rare at Micron.","1. Micron is turning into Sandisk v. 2.0. There have been few internal promotions to executive levels since Sanjay took over, with most new blood coming from Sandisk and almost all are are non-American and have no clue about the culture in places like Idaho, Utah or Virginia; that culture is what made Micron a success and they're killing it.
2. The executive team (the C-Suite execs in particular) are COMPLETELY disconnected from the operations of the company, seem unaware of the low morale they've created with the focus on their own wallets and power structures, and present a garbled, disjointed ""values"" system that is more marketing than a realistic plan to improve the soul of the company. For example, they espouse the value ""we care about our people"" while at the same time kicking team members out the back door.
3. The new performance management scheme is a thinly veiled attempt to lay-off 10-15% of American workers every year for the next 5-7 years. While unspoken, it's become apparent that Sanjay and his team have no respect for American workers. Each year, 10-15% of workers will receive a failing performance grade, and while there's an alleged path to redemption, in actuality it's nearly impossible for those workers to meet the arbitrary and unrealistic expectations defined in their ""performance improvement plan"". And since everyone is graded on a bell curve, every year another group of workers will fall into the failing category and be fired. This rank-and-yank system has been shown over and over in studies dating back to the 1980's that it lowers morale, turns the job into a popularity contest, lowers efficiency, and just doesn't work. The fact that it's in use in 2019 shows a level of incompetence and ignorance from the executive team, and doesn't engender a lot of trust among the hard working team members who make them successful. I personally know of dozens of highly skilled workers who are no longer with the company because of this scheme. 
4. Continuing from #3, it's obvious that Micron is trying to get away with performing layoffs without having to report that material information to the SEC, shareholders, and other stakeholders. It's a legal requirement in the U.S. that all workforce reductions above a certain percentage must be reported.
5. Expect to work 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, including on vacations, holidays, while sick, etc. With all the terminations and resignations, and with no back-filling of those positions being allowed, each team is doing the same job with less and less labor. The inevitable result of this is going to be more failing performance evaluations and more firings. It's a vicious cycle that will see workers spending more and more hours on the job, never quite catching up to the work-load, being told they're failures, and morale will continue to decline. 
6. While you're expected to be on-call 24/7 and available by phone, remote connection or pager, the company doesn't provide equipment beyond a cheap 80's era pager with which to communicate (and even that's only 1 way communication). With 10+ billion in profit last year, the least the company could do is provide cheap smart phones for all team members who are expected to act 24/7 in the case of an emergency.
7. The CEO is using the tax breaks provided in the new 2017 tax law to make $10B in stock buybacks. Even as market conditions deteriorate, the exec team is stubbornly sticking to the buyback plan. This goes completely against the alleged ""progressive"" values the company purports to support.
8. Expect to have your ""priorities"" shifted on a regular basis, often while in the middle of a project that was top priority just 2 weeks ago. The company's strategic planning is non-existent, and often happens after the action period has already started. For example, it's March 2019, 6 months into the fiscal year, and upper management is still deciding how to execute on the (non-existent) strategic plan for the year. Also, everything is a top priority, which means nothing is really a priority, and this contributes to low morale and indecisiveness by team members and their departments.
9. Departments often have objectives that conflict with other departments, and often those conflicts are resolved by whichever VP can yell the loudest or who knows the most powerful C-Suite exec. I've been in meetings where I spent an hour listening to VP's and Directors scream and cuss at each other, and I've even seen several people threatening violence. Those people are still with the company and leads to my next point:
10. Many upper management and executive level leaders use a management style reminiscent of 1980's era thinking. Management by fear. Management by negativity. Management by impossible expectations. Management by dictate. Management by enforced cutthroat competitions among team members.
11. The company is slowly shifting American workers to India - expect to train your replacement if your department is one of those being off-shored.
12. The environment for a regular cubicle worker is terrible. The lighting is bad, people are packed in like sardines, the decor is drab, there's very little natural light, and overall it doesn't contribute to happy, healthy and productive workers.
13. The mental health of a lot of workers is extremely compromised. Combine a poor physical work environment with cutthroat survival competitions, shifting priorities, opaque direction from the executive team, the fear of dropping into the bottom 15%, the hostility from management towards mid-management and front-line team members, and their are a lot of people in a really bad place mentally and emotionally.

It's amazing to see the change and refinement that has happened just in the past few years.  The culture of improvement permeates the whole company. 

The size of the company provides a lot of opportunities for career changes and exposure to different fields of work.  When I started to realize the field of work I was in wasn't where I wanted to be in the long run, there were a lot of options for broadening my horizons.  Micron's education assistance was especially helpful.

Micron has a lot of locations, but Boise has been a wonderful place for my family and me.  A lot of people here are transplants, so there's a very open social scene among employees.  Boise is also a great place for outdoor recreation.","Micron is in a volatile industry, so it operates under a high level of risk.  About 10% of the workforce was laid off in 2007, and there were a similar number of layoffs about 5 years before that.  Having said that, Micron has really gotten good at taking care of the people they lay off.  People I knew who were laid off were given generous severance packages and job placement assistance.

Micron gives its managers a lot of leeway within their areas, so there can be some wide variance with regard to dress code, hours worked, etc.  Some areas are more relaxed, but others will work you far too much, in my opinion.",Test Engineer,Current Employe,"Boise, ID","Jun 17, 2008"

like many other corporations they have their issues. 

It took a longer than normal time to even get considered for promotion, as compared to all my other pals who got jobs in other companies. it's hard because they were trying to make promotions more equal for all, which just made lazy people slack further and actually hard working people to bang their head against a wall.

A vocally said target: Embrace business volatility. Yes. running around with your head chopped off and then getting curbed stomped simultaneously. That's volatility!

361,1.0,Disappointing end....,Great pay and benefits.  For Boise the pay is very good.  A bit too much of the compensation is dependent upon the bonus and stock segments of the compensation.  If ALL you are looking for is money then its a good place to work.,"Workload,  HR policies, work environment, lack of internal job transfers, no work life balance. 

Workload/HR Policies.  I can't speak for the new grads or junior engineers but as a senior/principal level engineer the work load and job demands are unsustainable. Management will put performance requirements on you so you have to work so many hours to keep up that you have no afterwork life.  Management pushes you hard by using the whip of the ""stacked ranking"" system. They say they don't have quotas but it is obvious they do. And when caught and sued they backed off a bit. But I suspect after the dust settles on the lawsuit over the ranking quotas they will go back to it with a vengeance.   

Work environment.  With the ranking performance system I was beginning to see the fruits of that in that employees starting to cut corners, backstab other employees, and management playing employees against each other.  This makes for a miserable existence.  You are constantly looking over your shoulder and trying to give the illusion that you are happy and collaborating. 

If you're and older employee or a long time Boise employee watch out. They are working to exterminate you.  Management sends a clear message that we only want young workers.  The whole Diversity and Inclusion thing does not include older more experienced workers.  Just a diverse new ""top tier"" new grad worker population.  

There are no careers at Micron. Just jobs. Lots of them.. if you are a young new grad. As a senior engineer there are very few opportunities for you to move around. It seems very difficult to move around because they only want to hire new grads thus shutting out seasoned and experienced senior level engineers from moving in a direction they would like their career to go. So you have to leave. 

It pains me to say these things.  Micron had been good to me and my career for many many years. It was only around 2017/2018 that it took a turn for the worst.  It used to feel like family but not anymore.  You are just a piece of tooling that when you show the first signs of wear or break down they throw you away.

391,2.0,Pass on this job if you're truly an accountant,My supervisor was amazing and worked hard to make herself available to her staff.  I also really enjoyed the autonomy of just being able to do my job without being micromanaged.,"This is where it gets dicey.  I wasn't at Micron for a long period of time, long enough to know that it was not what I wanted to do long term.  If you're someone who needs a variety of tasks; this job isn't for you.  If you're someone who wants to make a difference or has ideas about change management; this job is not for you.  My job consisted of ""managing"" revenue for a sole distributor who did pretty much whatever they wanted.  This distributor is larger than Micron ever will be and Micron fails to see that this distributor will not adhere to Micron's ways.  Rather than finding a solution or instituting any kind of change; we were just forced to go through meeting after meeting about how horrible this distributor was.  Micron is not interested in a solution to their problem; instead they're just going to go through multiple accountants who will eventually realize that this is a dumpster fire that is never going to be put out....and they leave.  

That is just the Con about the job itself; there is a whole list of cons about the company overall.  People talk about the longevity of the staff here but when you actually talk to these employees they all the say the same thing; that the work sucks and the company blows but Micron pays better than everyone else so they're enslaved by their paychecks.  It's a very common theme here.  So is there rank and file system.   I was never made aware of their ""forced ranking system"" performance management system.  Had I known about it, I wouldn't have considered the offer.  That's an archaic way to manage people and all it does is instill mistrust and encourages competition among teammates instead of collaboration.  This has been the most depressing environment I have ever worked in, and I've worked for the IRS if that tells you anything.  The finance area is a sea of narrow, high walled, gray cubicles and there is zero natural light on this floor.  No one really talks to each other because we're all viewed as competition and nothing about this place encourages collaboration which fits in well with the ""every man for himself"" mentality that is prevalent here.

394,3.0,A Success Story (for now) from hardscrabble Idaho,"I write from the point of view of a senior design engineer. Micron is an incredible success story in a very unlikely place, mainly rural Idaho with just one small city, Boise. Certainly not a center of tech, and maybe just barely a ""creative capital"". If you are from Idaho working for Micron is a dream job and if you want to ""escape"" to a place with low home prices, wide open spaces, mountain-biking and skiing galore, relatively free of urban problems Micron might be your ticket to the kind of lifestyle you won't find in many places. While Micron is very subject to the economic cycles of the semiconductor industry and has laid off tons of people, they do want to do the right thing, it's not Silicon Valley after all but family-oriented Idaho. People are here for the long term. And if you are are a semiconductor manufacturing specialist or a memory expert you'll find very challenging and rewarding work here.","Hardscrabble Idaho culture, basically a very conservative outlook with a strong aversion to risk and a fanatical dedication to cost cutting makes this a very hard place to innovate or even to feel that innovative or entrepreneurial ideas are welcome. Micron, as an extraordinary survivor in a tough business feels it has the formula for success down and has as much resistance to change built into every facet of its operation as any company I've ever seen. Actually, you feel here that you've entered a time warp, everything is early 80s from the sea of grey cubicles, to the management practices, to the strict 8-5 ""shift"" working hours, and even the smoking break rooms. There is some effort to ""pay for performance"" but the potential rewards are modest and, in any case, stingily doled out. If you have worked in technology other than at Micron and Idaho is not your dream destination you are going to be deeply shocked by the culture here. Still, tech culture is not all rosy and the tradeoffs at Micron are not all bad. The question, though, is what will happen to arthritic Micron if - when - they are faced with the next disruptive wave in their corner of the technology world.",,Current Employe,"Boise, ID","Mar 18, 2012"
395,4.0,Team work oriented and family value emphasized,Nice balance between work and family.,Virtually no bonus due to keen competition in DRAM industry.  Profit from NAND and NOR is not sufficient to offset the loss in DRAM.  A long way to turn profitable.,Senior Engineer,Current Employee,"Boise, ID","Sep 29, 2012"
396,4.0,Been a good place to work.  Look forward to the new transformed company.,Been a great place to work for quite some time.,"Seems like things are resistant to change - transformation effort has had its difficulties.  Change is always hard, at least Micron is trying new things.",Senior Software Engineer,Current Employee,"Boise, ID","Feb 17, 2014"
397,3.0,Great place to start a career but leave quickly once things get stale....,"The pros I list here are for Micron's Virginia site.  The site had an excellent employee training program for new hires and employees with a few years of experience.  The yearly review was very structured and I would venture to say it was fair.  There is a career ladder which lists the requirements for promotions and so on.  Basically, the site was very orderly and structured.  I feel that employee development was very good, up to a certain point.

I think the benefits are good.  I was an above average employee and I got promotions every 2 - 3 years.  But if you're not getting promotions, the salary increase will certainly stagnate.  The promotions also use to be very difficult, but it seemed to have relaxed in the last few years.","The cons I list here are for Micron's Virginia site.  Some of these cons might apply to any semiconductor fab and not just to Micron's Virginia fab.  This is a fab environment, so everyone is expected to be on site by 8am.  There is a daily morning meeting to discuss what happened the day before.  For some people, there is also a daily tactical meeting where a representative from every team in the fab meets to discuss the issue.  There always seems to be too many meetings.  

This site is Micron's only wholly owned fab in the US.  It is has become a legacy fab and I don't expect there to be any new technologies to be coming to this site.

The culture seems to be focused on how much time you spend at work and not about results.  I think the strongest argument for this point of view is that one of the metrics for promotions is starting/ending times at the site for a 3 - 6 month period.  If the person about to be promoted didn't spend enough hours at work, their promotion would be delayed.

The last con I can think of is that this site is the only semiconductor site in the northern VA area.  This leads to a lack of competition for Micron.  Employees can't negotiate very well in this kind of environment and management doesn't see any need to offer any sort of perks for their employees.",Product Engineer,Former Employee,"Manassas, VA","Oct 8, 2014"
