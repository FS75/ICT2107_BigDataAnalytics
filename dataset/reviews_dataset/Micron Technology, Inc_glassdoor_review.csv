0,5,Good place for work life balance,Great place to work with work-life balance,not bad company to have less pressure,Engineer,Current Employee,,"Mar 29, 2023"
1,3,Great place to start a career. Not good for long term.,Good place to start a career. There are many diverse and challenging problems to work on. Great engineers to work with and learn from.,"Initial training is relatively poor, approach is very sink-or-swim. They have worked hard to improve this over the years, and it has gotten better, but they need to focus more in this area. Very little upward mobility, unless you are part of the club. Management is out-of-touch and too focused on satisfying their bosses at the expense of their directs. DRAM is a commodity that goes through cycles. While upper management is obviously aware of this, they do little to protect the business from downcycles and overspend during upcycles. Layoffs often occur every 3-5 years as a result. Management pays a lot of lip service to innovation. However, they are only interested in innovation that is very specific to the product. Peripheral innovation is often ignored or disregarded. The culture focuses on a reactionary instead of proactive approach to engineering. Many future problems could be avoided by taking a proactive QC minded approach, but management is often not supportive. Forced poor performance scoring to meet a quota. A lot of good engineers have lost jobs as a result of playing number games. Vaccine mandate.",Senior Product Engineer,Former Employee,"Boise, ID","Mar 9, 2023"
2,5,Great place to work and grow a career,"Great people to work with, wonderful team environment, good benefits, pay was good for location averages.

3,3,Culture Is Transitioning,"Great technology but most importantly, MU is getting much better at executing on their product roadmap - ramping leading-edge technology at the right time, when strategic customers need it. (That wasn't the case in the late 2000's/early 2010's)","The new CEO (Sanjay) can be credited for improving execution (see above) but at the expense of a people-friendly culture which made MU unique and appealing vs. most Silicon Valley companies. Long term employees are not valued the same. The culture has become much more rigid and ""corporate.""",Sales Manager,Former Employee,,"Mar 28, 2023"
4,1,Dont Join,"Good Immediate Colleagues, your experience might differ. Hybrid work atleast for now.","All words, when it really comes to implementation the Management fails hard. Find excuses to skip bonuses or promotions by C-suite. Severence package was bad compared to peers. Management decision led to merging our team with other team(which was for most part homogeneous, seemed like the sr dir hired his own people) led to the distruction of our diverse/open culture team(almost all of the previous team members noticed this and most left/transfered to other teams, in hindsight that was a good decision ).",Media Systems Engineer,Former Employee,,"Mar 24, 2023"

6,2,"Poor work-life balance, toxic company culture","Boise is a great place to work, and the semiconductor industry is very interesting.","Micron has a toxic company culture with bad work-life balance. The company is very internationally distributed now, so expect to work in both the US and Asia times zones simultaneously. This typically means 60 hours a week minimum. Additionally, the company culture is very cutthroat, and employees will frequently undercut and sabotage each other in order to protect their jobs. As a result, there is very little team cohesion and camaraderie.",Data Scientist,Former Employee,"Boise, ID","Mar 18, 2023"
7,4,Great people but poor work/life balance,Nice coworkers Good benefits and compensation,"Because of the flex schedule and remoting options you are expected to be available to coordinate with people overseas. You don't have much say in the meeting times (which change constantly). Expect to have to get up early and then attend late night meetings too. Don't expect the work day to be one solid chunk of time, and don't expect to be able to maintain a routine outside of work. I'd recommend printing out your weekly schedule and hanging it on the outside of your cubicle. This is to prevent non-engineering people from judging you for coming in late somedays and leaving early on others. Work hours will only be reasonable if you use the flex schedule.",Test Solution Engineer,Former Employee,"Boise, ID","Mar 1, 2023"
8,4,"Technology oriented mindset, not so employee freindly","1. Company is putting lots of emphasis on Technological advancement and securing industry leading position in terms of technology for both DRAM and NAND. That helps engineers to work in new technology and find innovative solutions. 2. Good opportunity to grow your career, promotions are generally not too much delayed. 3. Good alignment between remote work and in person work; never force to stay at office all time if jobs are done timely. 4. Good health insurance benefits for both employee and their dependents.","1. Very reluctant to increase compensation package compared to competitors specially for Boise area where cost of living and housing increased dramatically over last few years. 2. Doesn't put enough resources and manpower for challenging projects resulting in long office hours/late night works for employees. 3. Work life balance is very poor due to less than required manpower and collaboration with sites at different parts of world . And company doesn't seem to care much about the well being of employees. 4. Recently lost lots of talented people to competitors and Company is struggling to hire quality engineers due to low salary offers, current hiring freeze, overall increasing living cost in Boise metro area. This eventually lowers manpower resource degrading work life balance even more and put the company in more challenging position.",Engineer,Current Employee,"Boise, ID","Dec 4, 2022"

11,3,"Not the worst, but the culture kinda sucks","Interesting technical problems, some really great engineers and people, Boise is a fairly nice city (especially if you bought your house awhile ago), a strong and experienced manager can make a huge difference protecting from much of the BS from above","Biggest problem here is that the company loves managers more than engineers. Much easier to climb the ladder and get more money by turning into a manager than by being a technically competent engineer who is respected by their peers. The company is filled with layers and layers of management. Another big problem is the current CEO’s very heavy-handed, top-down approach. Managers and directors often have little room to apply their own discretion. Stacked rankings and restrictive WFH policies are evidence. The reward loyalty with meager raises, at least in Boise. Corporate believes that people won’t uproot their lives by leaving Idaho to change jobs so they skimp on the perks.",Principal Engineer,Former Employee,,"Feb 10, 2023"

Several of the individuals in government affairs are a delight to work with.,Poor public affairs leader. No strategy. Very clique-ish within the team.

23,2,Very Corporate no work life balance,"Not many ""pros"" for this company. Good technical training and some helpful people. Gives you some visibility to what other companies are doing with the products.","1) Bad process training and contact training. Unless you've been with the company for a number of years, don't expect anyone to tell you who to talk to get answers or things done. There was absolutely zero training on what each group in Micron did. 

2) Also don't expect a work life balance here. You'll work from 6am - 11pm, which leaves you tired the next door all the way through the weekend. Everyone on vacation is expected to work on their vacation to reply to customers or to co-workers.  You may even get messages on Teams during the weekend. 

3)Company is super corporate, so don't expect them to be a ""family"", numbers are the only thing that matter.  Good or bad performance, when the revenue dips for one quarter, expect layoffs, with zero transparency when they will happen. Layoffs were announced right before Christmas, and nothing happened till mid February. So a month of anxiety will await you.  Also beware of politics, people will not share information or workload for job security. 

4)Technology-wise always behind S-----g. So talking to customers will be a pain. Slow processes within the company will make your job harder. Documentation isn't good when looking back on older issues, very minimal comments made. 

5) Insurance is also bad, coverage isn't great. The type of medications that are covered are bad.

42,3,Interesting work,"The most positive aspect of working at Micron is that the Semiconductor Manufacturing Industry is an interesting work environment for all disciplines of engineering. There is a large variety of systems and processes which require curious technical people to maintain, troubleshoot and upgrade. Memory chip technology improves every 12 months so change is constant. If you like change, you will love it.","Despite their superficial efforts, Management has never been able to make people feel valued. Sure, they love to say ""people are our most valuable resource"" but don't demonstrate it. Everyone working at Micron knows that the factories, processing machines, and raw materials cost billions and are really the most valuable assets. To make things worse, Micron has adopted a forced-ranking performance management system that forces managers to use the full distribution of ratings (1 through 5) during yearly performance reviews. This is like the old GE system of terminating 10% of the workforce every year to create turnover. There are many experienced and talented employees at Micron and some groups are mostly comprised of these types. This forces managers of those groups to artificially rate people high and low. This leads to employees distrusting the process and Management and reduces collaboration due to internal team competition. Please note that Micron Top Management would claim that what I'm saying about the forced-ranking is not true, but I've talked with a number of mid-level managers, off the record, and they've confirmed it.",Engineer,Current Employee,"Manassas, VA","Feb 5, 2023"

There is no limits to growth within the company, if you are willing to make the effort. Management is very good and makes sure that the employees are well connected with them. Benefits are great and are always updated from time to time so employees can have the best without any stress. On-campus meal time lunches and dinners are top quality and the company makes sure that everyone can afford it. This is the place to build excellent careers because management also makes sure all the resources and training are provided for.

71,5,Has made great strides,"The company has improved markedly over the past 10 years. While there is still cost-cutting during downturns, there is less kneejerk cost cutting. The company is now leading the industry instead of being the perpetual laggard and has a healthy profit margin and cash flow. Sanjay and his team has done a good job with this transformation. There is more focus on work-life balance and on employee satisfaction and feedback as well which is positive and real pressure is being applied on departments that are lagging in either. Some departments suffer from a dog-eat-dog culture of toxic politics and constant scheming, kingdom-building and maneuvering rather than collaboration. Other departments truly work as a team, everyone pulling in the same direction. The good news is that, being a large company, there is generally an opportunity to move to a different/better department if your current one is not a good fit.","Your experience will still, to a very large degree, depend on your managers and your VP. My experience with different departments has been day and night, so make sure to ask employees in the department you're planning on joining for their honest feedback. While there is much more focus on work-life balance and employee satisfaction, there are still departments that are largely either unable, or unwilling, to improve either. Some departments are very spread out geographically, which drives a lot of meetings at night for US employees when having to collaborate with Asia, and often you will also have meetings early in the morning - bookending a very long workday.

The company is now leading the industry instead of being the perpetual laggard and has a healthy profit margin and cash flow. Sanjay and his team has done a good job with this transformation. There is more focus on work-life balance and on employee satisfaction and feedback as well which is positive and real pressure is being applied on departments that are lagging in either. Some departments suffer from a dog-eat-dog culture of toxic politics and constant scheming, kingdom-building and maneuvering rather than collaboration. Other departments truly work as a team, everyone pulling in the same direction. The good news is that, being a large company, there is generally an opportunity to move to a different/better department if your current one is not a good fit.","Your experience will still, to a very large degree, depend on your managers and your VP. My experience with different departments has been day and night, so make sure to ask employees in the department you're planning on joining for their honest feedback. While there is much more focus on work-life balance and employee satisfaction, there are still departments that are largely either unable, or unwilling, to improve either. Some departments are very spread out geographically, which drives a lot of meetings at night for US employees when having to collaborate with Asia, and often you will also have meetings early in the morning - bookending a very long workday. There is often some flexibility to take some time off during the day, but that will largely depend on your local management - again, your experience will be entirely dependent on your immediate managers and the VP and how they decide to run things.

I believe some recruiters give false promises to get new grads to work for them. There are obviously many benefits to employment with micron but they over sell it to the point where its misleading. The sentiment that is thrown around is that by these recruiters it harder for the new grads to leave and get a new job than not take the job in the first place.

195,2,Leadership changes needed!,"Some good people (at the engineering level)
Advanced Memory Technology","There are obviously good aspects of Micron, but the negative far exceeds the positive. When I joined Micron, the 1st 6 months were your typical “honeymoon” period where upper management treated people with some respect. At the same time, living in Boise for the first time, all I heard from people throughout the city and local county is that Micron is not a favorable place to work. After about 10 months or so, is where I finally started to see where the negativity was coming from. I want to highlight 7 key items that many who work or have worked at Micron can relate to:
1. Since Micron is based in Boise there are no other tech companies around. Due to this fact, upper management knows that they have the upper hand on people that want to stay in the area. They can demote, embarrass, or move you to another department, and the employee will have no choice but to accept. This does not happen in the Bay area because you have so many other opportunities and good people can go anywhere they like.

2. Micron hires experienced engineers from other companies’ primary that have NVM (NAND) experience. They essentially just drain the knowledge out of them and then treat them as stated above and then just go through the same cycle over and over again. This is well documented in many articles where people have stated that Micron hires their competitors and use all their knowledge. However, their technical leadership team that has been there for more than 15 years takes all the credit for all the outsiders tech innovation. Recently, Micron has experienced a large attrition compared to most tech companies. Some departments lost over 50% of their employees because of poor working conditions such as forcing engineers to work onsite 100% of the time AND travel to Asia during COVID in 2020 and 2021.
3. Upper leadership only cares about the employee survey. Some of the management requests that you have a pre-meeting(s) with your employee so you can understand the questions of the survey and make sure to have a positive outlook on the company. The last time I checked, a survey should be taken by the employee without any outside bias influence. When the survey results are low, they start pointing fault to the working class engineers. They say the survey is anonymous, but we all know that is not true. Asia/Singapore surveys for Micron do very well because they are forced to check the positive boxes or else there will be consequences. Micron claims diversity and inclusion but that is not evident at all.

4. If you want to succeed in Micron’s Technology Department, you have to be in 2 categories. 1.You need to kiss up and be in the right group, & 2. In engineering meetings, you better just start asking questions, or as management states, “you must make noise”, because if you don’t, then you don’t understand the technology”. Many people that work at Micron can relate to this type of the person in a meeting that always says: “Oh wait, can you go back 2 slides……uh, uh, that slide makes no sense, uh, yeah, I don't understand'….this probably happens in EVERY meeting. A great CEO once told me that the ones that speak the least most of the time are the ones that do the actual work. At Micron, just speak the loudest and ask the most irrelevant questions in a meeting so that others think you are engaged but really have no idea what you are talking about, and you will do just fine.

5. I had a manager that came to Micron that worked at a couple of other tech companies and he was probably the most knowledgeable in his field. Yet, management treated him and our team so poorly that most of us left. He brought a sense of humor, cared for everyone in the group, and mentored all of us. At the end, our module(s) surpassed the previous 2 tech nodes, but we were not part of the click group. Remember, employees have no other place to go in Boise, right? 

6. The good thing about COVID is that it brought an option of remote work including opening the doors for experienced engineers to work in a variety of other fields and companies throughout different states. In addition, it exposed Micron on their overall compensation for employees. People on reviews claim that Micron compensates well, but most of these employees have only worked for Micron. Micron’s competitors pay far more “overall” compensation.

7. Finally, I have to say that Micron’s sense of management reporting is by far the worst in the semiconductor industry. Many Boise technology employees report to Asia/Singapore management and are reviewed by their management. Micron also moves some of their most inexperienced engineers in into the most difficult technology orgs and puts them in charge. I guess that is not a problem, because the real people doing the work will be other that were brought over from the competitor companies. Remember, if you worked at Micron for over 15 years and are in the click group, you will be taken care of. That means others that were hired from other companies or even new college graduates will get the low rating at the end of the year.

The statement “employees don’t leave companies, they leave toxic cultures” is not entirely true, but over the last several years at Micron that has been the case. I would suggest that you look to see who is in charge and for how long at Micron. The elitist take care of themselves and keep themselves in power and that is a large part of Micron. Ask how attrition has been…if they state, “normal, just like the industry” that is a bold face lie. There are so many other companies out there, and I would highly suggest that Micron be at the bottom of the semiconductor list. If upper management does not get weeded out soon at Micron the same cycle will continue and Micron will truly take the top of the “toxic culture” work title.

A few small complaints: The site looks and feels dated, with cubicle walls that have been there for at least 25 years. The old cafeteria was converted into more cleanroom space, meaning the current cafeteria is in a large trailer. The food on site isn't particularly good and costs a lot.

281,3,"""Interesting"" Company to work with","(1) Overall compensation is very competitive to other companies within the industry, but this comes with a reason, God will not get you free lunch anyway. You will have to expect long working hours. But good news is when an existing team-member resigned or left, usually business will find 2-3 additional headcount to backfill the position, so this is a good news for the existing team-member. 

(2) As an employee, you do not need to have a skills and experiences for the role, if you have the correct attribute, have an excellent communication skills, and demonstrate a great networking and business acumen, it will be easy for you to get promoted level to level within 6 months.

(3) IMHO this company has min office politic, cos everyone will have to integrate their life into work, if you find someone playing politics, obviously that is the position you should consider JOP if you aim for work life balance.","(1) GPTW in my opinion is only applicable to some business/department, cos there is a group of people really need to sell their life & health to have the majority to vote the company for a GPTW. Just like OSCAR, audience will only know how talented are for the acting crew, how many people really appreciate the crew behind the scene?

(2) If you are hard-working type, but do not demonstrate that you have a excellent communication skills, networking is average and you probably need to look for alternative path, unless you decided to retire doing the same job till age 67. 

(3) Leaders does talk about career development with you, but 80% of them are an armchair strategist , you have to be lucky enough if you can meet the other 20%.

318,1,Thinking of working for Micron read here,They make good attempts to reach from the corporate level down to the bottom of the organizations at the different sites to get feedback and make policy or benefits changes. I like that they try to engage. The benefits are good.,"Pay is noncompetitive to the rest of the industry. They are ok being last in pay. If you are new or are accepting an offer from a Micron recruiter, just know you are being paid the bottom of your pay level and less than people at other companies in the same job. 

They make no attempt to retain any talent. Middle management at the Virginia site actively promotes based on nepotism versus skill, ability, value, or qualifications across all organizations. Attrition rates at the site are probably the worst in the Micron network of FABs over the last couple years. They lose more people than they can hire each month for years now. They are reaching critical staffing issues. 

I've heard managers openly brag about denying raises and promotions to get people to quit. The common phrase when I find out someone left coming from managers is the problem isn't us its they aren't a good fit here. There's no HR presence here, mangers can do any unethical thing here and its never followed up on and it's their word over anything. Any feedback given faces immediate retaliation, to sink a person's career if a manager finds out, so no one wants to give feedback on company surveys. they actually coach the departments on filling out the corporate surveys that its needs to be positive....and they tell their direct reports they can read all comments given and know who made them. I would not recommend anyone looking in this industry to work for Micron if you're looking to be a process technician, process engineer, or on the equipment side. Really any other company you will get more out of the experience and treated better. Every company has downsides so there's not always a grass is greener thing, but I don't understand why let your management be so toxic when there's such a shortage of people in the industry.

If you're looking for quick industry experience and you're a new engineer, just plan on a 1- or 2-year plan to get some experience and then leave as quick as you can, this is not where you want to have a career at. After all the years I've given to Micron I'm embarrassed to say I work for them. I have begun to look elsewhere I can't keep witnessing what's going on and continue to work for a place that has no values. I'm not angry at Micron just sad, because there's no reason for a business to operate that way.

388,2,Resigning could blackball you from future employment.,Coworkers are mostly really good people.  Innovation is minimally encouraged.,"If you’re a stellar performer and you resign for a better opportunity at another company, some in management tend to take it personally. They may walk you out the door immediately despite a 2+ week notice or longer offer to commit to complete current projects, work, or provide training for your replacement . Then if you do leave and try to come back, some former managers may bad-talk you to the the hiring manager. This short-sighted tactic effectively blackballs a former employee  from being rehired in the future and serves to  discourage from even applying again. This seems especially true if the former employee was a stellar performer and thought they had left on good terms. The Meritocracy implemented in recent years has caused many in management to “manage by spreadsheet” and to load their teams up with only degreed engineers and candidates that fit  diversity hiring criteria. This results in hiring team members based on racial, gender, and sexual orientation biases instead of competitively on a candidate’s ability to perform the job functions relative to other candidates. Hiring is slowwww. Taking 6months, 12months, or even longer from the date of application.

They pitched it so well and made it sound like they were really in for their people. Being through that initial phase now I am seeing the reality behind the image being pushed. The Execs care only for the dollar and will take drastic measures to protect it. I have witnessed one site first greatly reduced in technicians and now being completely sold off.

There is a large variety of systems and processes which require curious technical people to maintain, troubleshoot and upgrade. Memory chip technology improves every 12 months so change is constant. If you like change, you will love it.","Despite their superficial efforts, Management has never been able to make people feel valued. Sure, they love to say ""people are our most valuable resource"" but don't demonstrate it. Everyone working at Micron knows that the factories, processing machines, and raw materials cost billions and are really the most valuable assets. To make things worse, Micron has recently adopted a forced-ranking performance management system that forces managers to use the full distribution of ratings (1 through 5) during yearly performance reviews. This is like the old GE system of terminating 10% of the workforce every year to create turnover. There are many experienced and talented employees at Micron and some groups are mostly comprised of these types. This forces managers of those groups to artificially rate people high and low. This leads to employees distrusting the process and Management and reduces collaboration due to internal team competition. Please note that Micron Top Management would claim that what I'm saying about the forced-ranking is not true, but I've talked with a number of mid-level managers, off the record, and they've confirmed it.",Mechanical Engineer,Current Employee,"Manassas, VA","Dec 26, 2021"

462,2,Resigning could blackball you from future employment.,Coworkers are mostly really good people.  Innovation is minimally encouraged.,"If you’re a stellar performer and you resign for a better opportunity at another company, some in management tend to take it personally. They may walk you out the door immediately despite a 2+ week notice or longer offer to commit to complete current projects, work, or provide training for your replacement . Then if you do leave and try to come back, some former managers may bad-talk you to the the hiring manager. This short-sighted tactic effectively blackballs a former employee  from being rehired in the future and serves to  discourage from even applying again. This seems especially true if the former employee was a stellar performer and thought they had left on good terms. The Meritocracy implemented in recent years has caused many in management to “manage by spreadsheet” and to load their teams up with only degreed engineers and candidates that fit  diversity hiring criteria. This results in hiring team members based on racial, gender, and sexual orientation biases instead of competitively on a candidate’s ability to perform the job functions relative to other candidates. Hiring is slowwww. Taking 6months, 12months, or even longer from the date of application.

Because: Progress at the company is extremely slow and based on very strict and slim quotas, leaving behind many exceptionally productive and high-quality employees behind.

I would only recommend this work for either recent college grads for 1-2 years to stack money while looking for better 9-5 hour work, or potentially someone with no other medium income earning potential as they will hire just about any experience or education level.

Do NOT stay at this company longer than 2 years if you have a degree, or if you do you MUST become an engineer by that point or leave the company, otherwise you will be stuck there on shift 12 hour work for the rest of your life and won't have much to show for it.","12 hour shifts, likely forced to do nights as condition of your hire.
Very very poor leadership, no one in mid-level management or below is willing to speak truth to power or advocate for shift employees.

High performers get either pitiful or no meaningful recognition while mistake-prone or willfully negligent employees are allowed to breeze by. 

Even if the company has strong profits, you are not guaranteed a raise, and if you get one it will be pitiful and barely eek out inflation.

Management is very tone deaf and usually will yell for things to be done without bothering to understand underlying issues.

Also, for a billion dollar company they are very willing and even pleased to have run-down and out of date accommodations and facilities. The place looks and feels forgotten, as will you eventually on your computer!

Overall: Do not take this job for longer than 2 years if you have literally any other career prospects, take it and while you have it just use it as a security to interview like mad and negotiate hard for a good job you want elsewhere.",Process Technician II,Current Employee,"Manassas, VA","Jul 13, 2021"

There is resistance to change within the company, especially from employees who have worked here for their entire 20+ year career. Some departments are understaffed due to high attrition rates, leaving little bandwidth for high impact projects or personal development. In addition, training is either dated or non-existent so be prepared to leverage outside resources on your own time if you want to develop as an engineer.

601,1,High attrition rate and no work-life balance,Decent starting benefits (but that won't scale with experience and tenure) and a very diverse workforce,"Micron works their engineers into the ground. They implemented a rank and fire performance system three years ago which has sent morale straight into the toilet by creating a culture of mistrust and anger among their engineering teams. Each year more and more of Micron's top talent gets driven out of the company by the awful performance system paired with the lack of employee raises. 
The attrition rate is so high that several engineering teams are on the verge of collapse. Senior leaders can recognize the problem but their hands are tied by the executive leadership's unwillingness to hire more people or provide meaningful raises and bonuses to their most experienced and productive employees. 

 Micron's executives have gutted their engineering teams and have zero talent retention - you can get paid more and maintain a better work-life balance at any other company in this industry. Instead of addressing these issues Micron has decided to offshore more engineering work and now expects their US employees to work all day, meeting with their counterparts in India early in the morning and counterparts in Singapore late at night. Sometimes these problems get acknowledged in all hands meetings, but at the end of the day nothing gets done because leadership has structured the company in a way that requires engineers to expect 7AM meetings followed up with 9PM meetings several days each week.

Micron's leadership takes very real social issues such as diversity and inclusion and weaponizes them as subjects they can fill all-hands meetings with to pretend they're a good corporate citizen - because if they carry around a list of talking points about how racially diverse the company is with male-female pay equality they can sidestep questions about how they're underpaying EVERYONE compared to the rest of the industry and keep missing important milestones because they've driven out the top engineering talent.",Senior Engineer,Current Employee,,"Aug 25, 2021"

the pay when they first hire you seems great but it will never go up except when they have very infrequent market reviews and not much even then. 
way too many managers,positions are created for people who are good friends with upper management. if you`re a major kiss ass you will get a promotion but if you arent intimidated by management and aren't a ""yes man"" you`re stuck forever. no training is given to managers who have no emotional intelligence whatsoever and treat their employees like schoolchildren that need to be punished. the kind of inapproriate things said by the managers here is appalling.

If one gives you a bad peer review you can get even by giving them a bad review to get even. They can't even have the courage to deny promotions on their own which makes them cowards in my option.

1012,4,"I love our company, I think you would too","The people. One thing you will find is that the vast majority (there will always be naysayers/pessimists) is that we are all rowing in the same direction. We are working together and making our business better. I know I can go to my peers, team, or other teams for assistance and support and it won't be a challenge or fight. Instead we will work to solve the problem or issue and do so together. 

The work, we are not a sexy company in name recognition. However the work we do and the products we provide are critical to the technical innovation that happens every day on every continent. Without Micron's products the world would not be as technologically advanced as it is. We come to work knowing that what we do and accomplish enable the innovation of those working to make the world more accessible, cure previously incurable illnesses, solve problems thought to be impossible. It really is amazing to know we are a critical part of that.

Lastly corporate responsibility. Micron is a global leader when it comes to corporate social responsibility. Whether it is from ethical sourcing,  recycling,  community engagement,  charitable giving, human rights and treatment, and any other number of topics I know Micron is committed to being the best corporate citizen it can and it truly encourages us as team members to be the same.","We are a global company, this means long days, nights, mornings, etc... as we work to collaborate with our peers, suppliers, customers around the world. We have, over the past 2 years, have seen a genuine emphasis on improving our work-life balance (2-3 years ago I would have rated this a 1). However, the realities of being multinational will require flexibility in your work schedule. The great news is we as leaders are understanding and supportive of modified work schedules. The downside is that this will never be fully mitigated so if you are considering a career here, you should be aware that you may have days that start early, go late, or both to enable the effective collaboration of our global organization so don't be surprised by it. It can be difficult and challenging but it is getting better. I just never expect work-life balance to be our greatest strength.",Senior Manager,Current Employee,"Boise, ID","Jun 14, 2019"

Commitments are sometimes made and broken without hesitation. 

Numerous opportunities for growth in responsibilities and compensation, until...changes in leadership resulted in a bait-and-switch substitution of a different job in place of the one that I was recruited aggressively into - different duties, different boss, completely different package. In short, a deal I would have rejected three months earlier when the original deal was offered.

cant think of much else other than that..","If you`re an international that needs H1B sponsorship you will most likely get a job here but be aware that your green card processing will take FOREVER because they will not do EB2 even if you have a masters degree. they take a lot of advantage of internationals because they know you will continue to work for them because of sponsorship issues.
the pay when they first hire you seems great but it will never go up except when they have very infrequent market reviews and not much even then. 
way too many managers,positions are created for people who are good friends with upper management. if you`re a major kiss ass you will get a promotion but if you arent intimidated by management and aren't a ""yes man"" you`re stuck forever. no training is given to managers who have no emotional intelligence whatsoever and treat their employees like schoolchildren that need to be punished. the kind of inapproriate things said by the managers here is appalling. Horrible horrible management. Honestly its a lawsuit waiting to happen.

1016,5,Great Company,"Micron has been amazing, I have worked with a number of different facets of this company and I can say that it is one of the most employee focused one I have even heard of. I started in a position that I was interested in but quickly out grew as my talents were put to better use elsewhere. During the orientation they tell stories about how a guy/girl started out as a menial laborer and is now a VP due to hard work and dedication. When I hear these stories I typically disregard them as yet another motivational ""rags to riches"" story, at micron this is more then just a motivational tool but an actual fact and possibility. I have been in many different work environments and this one is far and above the best. Even at its worst there is always a light at the end of the tunnel, never is there that trapped feeling where you think that you just have to put up with the situation you are in or leave to a different company.",With the importance of promotion from within there is always the chance that a person who is not ready for a position may be promoted to one.,Design Engineer,Current Employee,"Boise, ID","Jun 28, 2020"

Typical LGBT agenda, far left refuge that nobody will talk about for fear of reprisals. Catering to the 2% and alienating off the rest of us. Sending tons of Jobs to Taiwan/China, and doing it secretly - 300 here, 200 there, 500 over there. Sanjay has sent more jobs overseas than just about any CEO.

1018,4,New Directions for Probe Engineering,"Micron has been growing for a number of years, and it endured some growing pains.  After it acquired some smaller memory companies (and one sizable one), the product portfolio became so big that probe and test engineering was severely strained by the workload.  While that's still true, the teams are adapting to the challenge with a stronger focus on cross-team collaboration and using newer and better tools to become more efficient.  There is a lot of opportunity to impact the success of the new game-changing products that are in the works, and the work extends far beyond simply writing code to test chips: there's a lot of understanding the physics and materials of the chips, the ways they fail, and the hardware they're tested on.  It is easy to keep busy in interesting ways.","Change is hard, and some engineers are set in their ways with how they get things done, which does slow progress.  There are also a few very strong personalities that unfortunately are allowed to dominate the environment, with some becoming overly negative or even hostile towards the work other engineers have accomplished.",Probe Engineer,Current Employee,"Boise, ID","Sep 4, 2017"

There has been a big push to institute social justice values under the title of inclussion.  Forced Bell curve.  I've seen so many hard and intelligent workers forced out because someone had to be a 2.  Resources are a joke. It's amazing as a company we've been able to do so much with so little to work with.  New CEO has burned milliions on making the place look nicer instead of highering people to keep the plant going. (they were layed off instead)   There was a time you could provide constructive criticism. Now it all seems to be fear driven, and it's every man for themself.

Biggest thing for me is that I feel like the work I do makes a positive difference to people and to the world in general.","Making a lot of progress, but still a lot of work to do with diversity and inclusion, especially in the area of women in leadership roles.

1100,1,Very poor work/life balance,The processes are interesting and should intrigue any engineer.,"The work/life balance is terrible. Almost everyone shows up earlier to work than expected and almost no one leaves  on time at the end of the day. You almost feel guilty for actually trying to follow your scheduled work hours since everyone else is working extra. 

A big part of this is not staffing enough technicians and not training people well enough after they get hired. This makes engineers do the technicians job in addition to their engineering duties which can be time consuming and stressful in my opinion. As for the training issue, it appears they rely on experienced individuals from other semiconductor companies to make up for the fact that they cannot grow and develop their own people.",Engineer,Current Employee,"Manassas, VA","Jun 12, 2019"

Women are accepted as 4 things: stay at home wife, teacher, secretary, nurse. That's it. Much of this ideology is carried into the work place at micron. I had coworkers make remarks such as ""I don't understand how people make a household work with two working parents, that could be bad for the kids"".  I also found that you get a lot of teasing and strange remarks that you don't get in larger, more liberal cities.

The last couple of years Micron has done very well and this year the bonus was probably the best I've ever seen. Yet, the recent layoffs using the forced bell curve ranking system have overshadowed the happiness that one should feel with Micron's success. 

I've seen and heard of terrible stories of good people getting low scores. Some of the scores were based on lies to help justify the low scores to remove individuals. Some stories of managers leaving Micron because they were being forced to give a low score when the individual didn't deserve it. 

Micron has had layoffs before and usually there is good justification for it. This last layoff, I have yet to understand the justification for it. Financially, this is the best that Micron has ever done. Sure, there are poor performers, they should be handled individually and appropriately.

Micron use of the forced bell curve ranking really doesn't make sense. It uses fear to increase performance, colleagues are now competing in the hope of keeping a high score and the collaboration goes down. You job is in question every year. If you do a google search for ""bell curve forced ranking"", you will find several articles stating that this method is outdated and doesn't increase performance and should not be used.

Sometimes getting new ideas implemented requires going through a lot of office politics, especially if some senior person is pushing their idea and wants to get another pip on their collar. The politics can get nasty, and it doesn't seem to be getting any better.

Micron is a place where I would recommend my kids working when they grow up and where I would be happy to retire if given the opportunity.","Micron is slow to adopt change. Working from home is discouraged and the management has poor leadership skills at a department level.  For example, since a lot of the management has come up from production, many managers watch the clock for professionals on salary and they treat their people like production line employees. 

Many of the Managers have also come up from technical positions, so their understanding of business is limited and their leadership skills are mediocre to poor. Micron tends to think that technical expertise is more important than business and/or leadership expertise so there isn't balance in the team skill sets. Once these individuals are promoted to these roles, many of them have an attitude that they are too busy or already know what they need. Many never pursue  additional training and classes.

Micron is a very diverse company, family oriented, with very decent benefits.","The new CEO, Sanjay Mehrotra, has done some good, but, unfortunately the new system of forced bell  curve ranking has changed my views of Micron. The last couple of years Micron has done very well and this year the bonus was probably the best I've ever seen. Yet, the recent layoffs using the forced bell curve ranking system have overshadowed the happiness that one should feel with Micron's success. 

I've seen and heard of terrible stories of good people getting low scores. Some of the scores were based on lies to help justify the low scores to remove individuals. Some stories of managers leaving Micron because they were being forced to give a low score when the individual didn't deserve it. 

Micron has had layoffs before and usually there is good justification for it. This last layoff, I have yet to understand the justification for it. Financially, this is the best that Micron has ever done. Sure, there are poor performers, they should be handled individually and appropriately.

Micron use of the forced bell curve ranking really doesn't make sense. It uses fear to increase performance, colleagues are now competing in the hope of keeping a high score and the collaboration goes down. You job is in question every year. If you do a google search for ""bell curve forced ranking"", you will find several articles stating that this method is outdated and doesn't increase performance and should not be used.

1177,1,Wouldn't recommend unless you have no other options,"- The pay is about average for the industry, which translates into good compensation if you're in a low cost area like Boise. If you're in a high-cost area, the salaries aren't as competitive.
- There are some truly good people working hard in the trench","1. Micron is turning into Sandisk v. 2.0. There have been few internal promotions to executive levels since Sanjay took over, with most new blood coming from Sandisk and almost all are are non-American and have no clue about the culture in places like Idaho, Utah or Virginia; that culture is what made Micron a success and they're killing it.
2. The executive team (the C-Suite execs in particular) are COMPLETELY disconnected from the operations of the company, seem unaware of the low morale they've created with the focus on their own wallets and power structures, and present a garbled, disjointed ""values"" system that is more marketing than a realistic plan to improve the soul of the company. For example, they espouse the value ""we care about our people"" while at the same time kicking team members out the back door.
3. The new performance management scheme is a thinly veiled attempt to lay-off 10-15% of American workers every year for the next 5-7 years. While unspoken, it's become apparent that Sanjay and his team have no respect for American workers. Each year, 10-15% of workers will receive a failing performance grade, and while there's an alleged path to redemption, in actuality it's nearly impossible for those workers to meet the arbitrary and unrealistic expectations defined in their ""performance improvement plan"". And since everyone is graded on a bell curve, every year another group of workers will fall into the failing category and be fired. This rank-and-yank system has been shown over and over in studies dating back to the 1980's that it lowers morale, turns the job into a popularity contest, lowers efficiency, and just doesn't work. The fact that it's in use in 2019 shows a level of incompetence and ignorance from the executive team, and doesn't engender a lot of trust among the hard working team members who make them successful. I personally know of dozens of highly skilled workers who are no longer with the company because of this scheme. 
4. Continuing from #3, it's obvious that Micron is trying to get away with performing layoffs without having to report that material information to the SEC, shareholders, and other stakeholders. It's a legal requirement in the U.S. that all workforce reductions above a certain percentage must be reported.
5. Expect to work 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, including on vacations, holidays, while sick, etc. With all the terminations and resignations, and with no back-filling of those positions being allowed, each team is doing the same job with less and less labor. The inevitable result of this is going to be more failing performance evaluations and more firings. It's a vicious cycle that will see workers spending more and more hours on the job, never quite catching up to the work-load, being told they're failures, and morale will continue to decline. 
6. While you're expected to be on-call 24/7 and available by phone, remote connection or pager, the company doesn't provide equipment beyond a cheap 80's era pager with which to communicate (and even that's only 1 way communication). With 10+ billion in profit last year, the least the company could do is provide cheap smart phones for all team members who are expected to act 24/7 in the case of an emergency.
7. The CEO is using the tax breaks provided in the new 2017 tax law to make $10B in stock buybacks. Even as market conditions deteriorate, the exec team is stubbornly sticking to the buyback plan. This goes completely against the alleged ""progressive"" values the company purports to support.
8. Expect to have your ""priorities"" shifted on a regular basis, often while in the middle of a project that was top priority just 2 weeks ago. The company's strategic planning is non-existent, and often happens after the action period has already started. For example, it's March 2019, 6 months into the fiscal year, and upper management is still deciding how to execute on the (non-existent) strategic plan for the year. Also, everything is a top priority, which means nothing is really a priority, and this contributes to low morale and indecisiveness by team members and their departments.
9. Departments often have objectives that conflict with other departments, and often those conflicts are resolved by whichever VP can yell the loudest or who knows the most powerful C-Suite exec. I've been in meetings where I spent an hour listening to VP's and Directors scream and cuss at each other, and I've even seen several people threatening violence. Those people are still with the company and leads to my next point:
10. Many upper management and executive level leaders use a management style reminiscent of 1980's era thinking. Management by fear. Management by negativity. Management by impossible expectations. Management by dictate. Management by enforced cutthroat competitions among team members.
11. The company is slowly shifting American workers to India - expect to train your replacement if your department is one of those being off-shored.
12. The environment for a regular cubicle worker is terrible. The lighting is bad, people are packed in like sardines, the decor is drab, there's very little natural light, and overall it doesn't contribute to happy, healthy and productive workers.
13. The mental health of a lot of workers is extremely compromised. Combine a poor physical work environment with cutthroat survival competitions, shifting priorities, opaque direction from the executive team, the fear of dropping into the bottom 15%, the hostility from management towards mid-management and front-line team members, and their are a lot of people in a really bad place mentally and emotionally.

This makes Micron incredibly susceptible to some of the fundamental Econ 101 Supply/Demand dynamics and a very volatile business to be in.

If not we lose it),"There has been a push in the last 2 years around making Micron the best company to work for. Unfortunately, this is truly about the numbers and not the people. Staked ranking systems, being pushed to work like Silicon Valley but not giving Silicon Valley pay, and leadership driving team members to breaking points by pushing more and more initiatives on extremely short timelines. 
The diverse workforce has a ways to go with women in top leadership roles still lacking. The CEO talks of having women in those roles yet he has not hired a single woman VP to report to him. The only woman that does, was here before he arrived.

Since its founding, Micron leadership has been extremely focused on learning and getting better at everything we do.  It's amazing to see the change and refinement that has happened just in the past few years.  The culture of improvement permeates the whole company. 

The size of the company provides a lot of opportunities for career changes and exposure to different fields of work.  When I started to realize the field of work I was in wasn't where I wanted to be in the long run, there were a lot of options for broadening my horizons.  Micron's education assistance was especially helpful.

Micron has a lot of locations, but Boise has been a wonderful place for my family and me.  A lot of people here are transplants, so there's a very open social scene among employees.  Boise is also a great place for outdoor recreation.","Micron is in a volatile industry, so it operates under a high level of risk.  About 10% of the workforce was laid off in 2007, and there were a similar number of layoffs about 5 years before that.  Having said that, Micron has really gotten good at taking care of the people they lay off.  People I knew who were laid off were given generous severance packages and job placement assistance.

Micron gives its managers a lot of leeway within their areas, so there can be some wide variance with regard to dress code, hours worked, etc.  Some areas are more relaxed, but others will work you far too much, in my opinion.",Test Engineer,Current Employee,"Boise, ID","Jun 17, 2008"

1208,3,Good company  but employees don't feel valued,"The most positive aspect of working at Micron is that the Semiconductor Manufacturing Industry is an interesting work environment for all disciplines of engineering. There is a large variety of systems and processes which require curious technical people to maintain, troubleshoot and upgrade. Memory chip technology improves every 12 months so change is constant. If you like change, you will love it.","Despite their superficial efforts, Management has never been able to make people feel valued. Sure, they love to say ""people are our most valuable resource"" but don't demonstrate it. Everyone working at Micron knows that the factories, processing machines,  and raw materials cost billions and are really the most valuable assets. To make things worse, Micron has recently adopted a forced-ranking performance management system that forces managers to use the full distribution of ratings (1 through 5) during  yearly performance reviews. This is like the old GE system of terminating 10% of the workforce every year to create turnover.  There are many experienced and talented employees at Micron and some groups are mostly comprised of these types. This forces managers of those groups to artificially rate people high and low. This leads to employees distrusting the process and Management and reduces collaboration due to internal team competition. Please note that Micron Top Management would claim that what I'm saying about the forced-ranking is not true, but I've talked with a number of mid-level managers, off the record and they've confirmed it.",Engineer,Current Employee,,"Jun 30, 2019"

1280,1,Wouldn't recommend unless you have no other options,"- The pay is about average for the industry, which translates into good compensation if you're in a low cost area like Boise. If you're in a high-cost area, the salaries aren't as competitive.
- There are some truly good people working hard in the trench","1. Micron is turning into Sandisk v. 2.0. There have been few internal promotions to executive levels since Sanjay took over, with most new blood coming from Sandisk and almost all are are non-American and have no clue about the culture in places like Idaho, Utah or Virginia; that culture is what made Micron a success and they're killing it.
2. The executive team (the C-Suite execs in particular) are COMPLETELY disconnected from the operations of the company, seem unaware of the low morale they've created with the focus on their own wallets and power structures, and present a garbled, disjointed ""values"" system that is more marketing than a realistic plan to improve the soul of the company. For example, they espouse the value ""we care about our people"" while at the same time kicking team members out the back door.
3. The new performance management scheme is a thinly veiled attempt to lay-off 10-15% of American workers every year for the next 5-7 years. While unspoken, it's become apparent that Sanjay and his team have no respect for American workers. Each year, 10-15% of workers will receive a failing performance grade, and while there's an alleged path to redemption, in actuality it's nearly impossible for those workers to meet the arbitrary and unrealistic expectations defined in their ""performance improvement plan"". And since everyone is graded on a bell curve, every year another group of workers will fall into the failing category and be fired. This rank-and-yank system has been shown over and over in studies dating back to the 1980's that it lowers morale, turns the job into a popularity contest, lowers efficiency, and just doesn't work. The fact that it's in use in 2019 shows a level of incompetence and ignorance from the executive team, and doesn't engender a lot of trust among the hard working team members who make them successful. I personally know of dozens of highly skilled workers who are no longer with the company because of this scheme. 
4. Continuing from #3, it's obvious that Micron is trying to get away with performing layoffs without having to report that material information to the SEC, shareholders, and other stakeholders. It's a legal requirement in the U.S. that all workforce reductions above a certain percentage must be reported.
5. Expect to work 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, including on vacations, holidays, while sick, etc. With all the terminations and resignations, and with no back-filling of those positions being allowed, each team is doing the same job with less and less labor. The inevitable result of this is going to be more failing performance evaluations and more firings. It's a vicious cycle that will see workers spending more and more hours on the job, never quite catching up to the work-load, being told they're failures, and morale will continue to decline. 
6. While you're expected to be on-call 24/7 and available by phone, remote connection or pager, the company doesn't provide equipment beyond a cheap 80's era pager with which to communicate (and even that's only 1 way communication). With 10+ billion in profit last year, the least the company could do is provide cheap smart phones for all team members who are expected to act 24/7 in the case of an emergency.
7. The CEO is using the tax breaks provided in the new 2017 tax law to make $10B in stock buybacks. Even as market conditions deteriorate, the exec team is stubbornly sticking to the buyback plan. This goes completely against the alleged ""progressive"" values the company purports to support.
8. Expect to have your ""priorities"" shifted on a regular basis, often while in the middle of a project that was top priority just 2 weeks ago. The company's strategic planning is non-existent, and often happens after the action period has already started. For example, it's March 2019, 6 months into the fiscal year, and upper management is still deciding how to execute on the (non-existent) strategic plan for the year. Also, everything is a top priority, which means nothing is really a priority, and this contributes to low morale and indecisiveness by team members and their departments.
9. Departments often have objectives that conflict with other departments, and often those conflicts are resolved by whichever VP can yell the loudest or who knows the most powerful C-Suite exec. I've been in meetings where I spent an hour listening to VP's and Directors scream and cuss at each other, and I've even seen several people threatening violence. Those people are still with the company and leads to my next point:
10. Many upper management and executive level leaders use a management style reminiscent of 1980's era thinking. Management by fear. Management by negativity. Management by impossible expectations. Management by dictate. Management by enforced cutthroat competitions among team members.
11. The company is slowly shifting American workers to India - expect to train your replacement if your department is one of those being off-shored.
12. The environment for a regular cubicle worker is terrible. The lighting is bad, people are packed in like sardines, the decor is drab, there's very little natural light, and overall it doesn't contribute to happy, healthy and productive workers.
13. The mental health of a lot of workers is extremely compromised. Combine a poor physical work environment with cutthroat survival competitions, shifting priorities, opaque direction from the executive team, the fear of dropping into the bottom 15%, the hostility from management towards mid-management and front-line team members, and their are a lot of people in a really bad place mentally and emotionally.

This makes Micron incredibly susceptible to some of the fundamental Econ 101 Supply/Demand dynamics and a very volatile business to be in.

If not we lose it),"There has been a push in the last 2 years around making Micron the best company to work for. Unfortunately, this is truly about the numbers and not the people. Staked ranking systems, being pushed to work like Silicon Valley but not giving Silicon Valley pay, and leadership driving team members to breaking points by pushing more and more initiatives on extremely short timelines. 
The diverse workforce has a ways to go with women in top leadership roles still lacking. The CEO talks of having women in those roles yet he has not hired a single woman VP to report to him. The only woman that does, was here before he arrived.

Since the focus is on the $, employees have little value. Most companies have to instill cost cutting measures during their life cycle. Do not expect a fair or respectable treatment at this company - there is a pending case in Idaho based on the company intentionally rating employees lower to reduce costs by terminating them and saving on performance rewards that would be due to employees.

I had 15 years experience and they still started me at the bottom.  They don't give pay raises either.  We had record profits this year and no one got raises.  Which means, as the cost of living goes up you will actually be making less.  It doesn't matter how hard you work.  You still get paid the same as everyone else.

New leadership is so focused on the stock price and not the employees. Spending $10 billion on buying back stock (legal stock price manipulation) while taking away training, travel, and the ability to hire good people.

1372,3,A Success Story (for now) from hardscrabble Idaho,"I write from the point of view of a senior design engineer. Micron is an incredible success story in a very unlikely place, mainly rural Idaho with just one small city, Boise. Certainly not a center of tech, and maybe just barely a ""creative capital"". If you are from Idaho working for Micron is a dream job and if you want to ""escape"" to a place with low home prices, wide open spaces, mountain-biking and skiing galore, relatively free of urban problems Micron might be your ticket to the kind of lifestyle you won't find in many places. While Micron is very subject to the economic cycles of the semiconductor industry and has laid off tons of people, they do want to do the right thing, it's not Silicon Valley after all but family-oriented Idaho. People are here for the long term. And if you are are a semiconductor manufacturing specialist or a memory expert you'll find very challenging and rewarding work here.","Hardscrabble Idaho culture, basically a very conservative outlook with a strong aversion to risk and a fanatical dedication to cost cutting makes this a very hard place to innovate or even to feel that innovative or entrepreneurial ideas are welcome. Micron, as an extraordinary survivor in a tough business feels it has the formula for success down and has as much resistance to change built into every facet of its operation as any company I've ever seen. Actually, you feel here that you've entered a time warp, everything is early 80s from the sea of grey cubicles, to the management practices, to the strict 8-5 ""shift"" working hours, and even the smoking break rooms. There is some effort to ""pay for performance"" but the potential rewards are modest and, in any case, stingily doled out. If you have worked in technology other than at Micron and Idaho is not your dream destination you are going to be deeply shocked by the culture here. Still, tech culture is not all rosy and the tradeoffs at Micron are not all bad. The question, though, is what will happen to arthritic Micron if - when - they are faced with the next disruptive wave in their corner of the technology world.",,Current Employee,"Boise, ID","Mar 18, 2012"
1373,4,Team work oriented and family value emphasized,Nice balance between work and family.,Virtually no bonus due to keen competition in DRAM industry.  Profit from NAND and NOR is not sufficient to offset the loss in DRAM.  A long way to turn profitable.,Senior Engineer,Current Employee,"Boise, ID","Sep 29, 2012"
1374,4,Been a good place to work.  Look forward to the new transformed company.,Been a great place to work for quite some time.,"Seems like things are resistant to change - transformation effort has had its difficulties.  Change is always hard, at least Micron is trying new things.",Senior Software Engineer,Current Employee,"Boise, ID","Feb 17, 2014"
1375,3,Great place to start a career but leave quickly once things get stale....,"The pros I list here are for Micron's Virginia site.  The site had an excellent employee training program for new hires and employees with a few years of experience.  The yearly review was very structured and I would venture to say it was fair.  There is a career ladder which lists the requirements for promotions and so on.  Basically, the site was very orderly and structured.  I feel that employee development was very good, up to a certain point.

I think the benefits are good.  I was an above average employee and I got promotions every 2 - 3 years.  But if you're not getting promotions, the salary increase will certainly stagnate.  The promotions also use to be very difficult, but it seemed to have relaxed in the last few years.","The cons I list here are for Micron's Virginia site.  Some of these cons might apply to any semiconductor fab and not just to Micron's Virginia fab.  This is a fab environment, so everyone is expected to be on site by 8am.  There is a daily morning meeting to discuss what happened the day before.  For some people, there is also a daily tactical meeting where a representative from every team in the fab meets to discuss the issue.  There always seems to be too many meetings.  

This site is Micron's only wholly owned fab in the US.  It is has become a legacy fab and I don't expect there to be any new technologies to be coming to this site.

The culture seems to be focused on how much time you spend at work and not about results.  I think the strongest argument for this point of view is that one of the metrics for promotions is starting/ending times at the site for a 3 - 6 month period.  If the person about to be promoted didn't spend enough hours at work, their promotion would be delayed.

The last con I can think of is that this site is the only semiconductor site in the northern VA area.  This leads to a lack of competition for Micron.  Employees can't negotiate very well in this kind of environment and management doesn't see any need to offer any sort of perks for their employees.",Product Engineer,Former Employee,"Manassas, VA","Oct 8, 2014"
1376,3,Reasonable place to work,Company is doing well recently.  Profit sharing is good. 401K matching is good.

Memory is a commodity product.  It's like apples, oranges or jelly beans.

1379,3,Not a top tier company,"Boise is a great location
Some great people
Diverse group of people
Benefits are good with insurance and 401k matching (5%)","The worst thing is the silos!! When you rate a group of people and force a bell curve and cut the low performers you get everyone fighting each other for a better rating instead of promoting collaboration. Not much changes either, things get rolled out that are supposed to make things better but it feels as though they dont actually consult the people that work here and go off what is done at other companies. Things go good for a bit then they just revert to doing things the way they always do.  Work life balance is also really bad, it feels like we work harder with less.  Back filing positions dont happen very often so if you are short on your team expect to work more to pick up the slack.  If you do work harder,  expect promotion or talks of a raise only once a year on a cycle (if the company is doing good enough) otherwise you keep working hard without increase.  Recognition is also hard to come by unless management is reminded to give praise.  If you are looking for best in class company they are not it but for a mid tier tech company they are good. Unless you are from a top tier school, they mostly hire from within so getting in is difficult.",Product Manager,Current Employee,"Boise, ID","Jun 12, 2019"

I stayed there from 2005-2018, working on various roles from shift engineering, process, integration, quality with some reassignments at Boise, ID and Singapore ... my good experiences are summarized as follows:
- good location for single individuals or young families. Manassas in general have the worst schools and crime in the area but the adjacent 'Linton Hall' and Fairfax districts have some of the best schools.
- Proximity to Washington DC (less than an hour's drive by car). Its like living close to Paris or Rome if you were to ask me. Close to Shenandoah State Park (again, less than an hour's drive). Northern VA is good if you are into Civil War history. Drive up and down and you'll be in Pennsylvania (Amish, Gettsyburg), Maryland (National Aquarium, NASA), North Carolina (Duke Univ, beaches)... Manhattan/NYC is 6 hours' drive up north.
- peers are generally nice, helpful and work really hard. 
- they send you to vendor training and will pay for your schooling as long as it fits your job role.
- they support green card applications for foreign workers.
- generous time off hours accumulation but whether or not they will approve your leave is another question.
-good 401k match at 6%. Need 4 yrs to vest.

The Manassas, VA location has the most toxic culture of all sites. It's a unique pressure cooker of stress that does not exist in other sites. The employees throw each other under the bus to cover their mistakes, don't recognize hard work, are two-faced, don't have accountability, and overall are miserable from being over-worked. Managemet is so far removed from the Fabrication process that the expectations and attitudes are unforgiving. Promotions are only given to yes-men rather than those qualified for the position. Perception is more important than achievements. The pattern at Fab 6 is to push more responsibilities onto existing team members rather than backfill open positions. The extra effort is rarely rewarded and regonized. Currently, Fab 6 is in the middle of an expansion which has been bungled from the start. Rather than extending the parking lot or make a garage, make shift parking was made after construction started and more people were on sight.

The company remains nearly 85% male and this sexism is furthered by promoting men to lower management positions from strongly male dominated cultures who may not even be aware they tend to promote men before women.
Micron has been working to reduce redundancy and non value tasks in Fab positions, but rarely rises to middle management jobs.  
Currently workers at the bottom of the production chain have picked up the off load of jobs from both the process and the tool sides.  MT's are now very few with generally double the workload they started with, but very very minimal increase in pay. No one knows how much work came actually correctly completed in one 12 hour shift. It seems like a strange strategy for cost cutting. Employee headcount goes down to bare bones causing their workload to increase even more, which leads to greater risk to the product and lower tool efficiency. Does eliminating low end low paying jobs save enough money to offset scrapped wafers and loss of tool production time? Even when you consider these employees are doing double duty for essentially the same pay rate?  Wouldn't retaining low cost labor instead provide an opportunity for a better distribution of work which could easily translate to less human scrap and less lost production time for tool malfunctions?
Last, it doesn't matter how hard you work, how much you know, how well you document your development, if you ask for additional responsibilities or for development opportunities to benefit your performance.

Supportive of education advancement.,"Not a lot of room for advancement once you reach a certain level.  Advancement seems to be predicated on whether you will go over seas to work.  Work culture has changed over time.  Not much accountability anymore and not as much reward either.

Manassas site usually runs the legacy products but still you get to learn both DRAM, NAND and NOR technologies. Great benefits. Headquarter office works hard to improve work life balance with policies. Nice industry reputation.","Manassas location has a very poor management. Goals are intentionly set higher than reasonable margins and managers are held accountable for not meeting those numbers. That pressure bubbles up while coming down to individual contributors. People are set for failure. For the last 18 months, the attrition rate was immensely high. Higher management covered up this problem by reporting to the corporate that lower performers were leaving the company. I personally know at least 15 incredible engineers left the company during that time. Some of them were the only ones who knew how the most critical equipments in photolithography area breaths in and out. That attrition impacted the plant operation which made the upper management even more fierceful. All of the mid- management is in survival mode to not to get in trouble with upper leadership and they don’t have any bravery to back up their direct reports. People are expected to work long hours.

1467,1,Advise Against for New Engineers,"Salary - Salary starts high initially, but there are no raises.  Only get raises through promotions.  Between promotions salary adjustments are done through meager industry reviews which basically adjust your salary for inflation

Vacation time is generous","Employees on floor are treated unprofessionally even if professional degrees have been obtained, at least initially.  Some people wind up in the good graces of management and their promotions and opportunities outpace others' by anywhere from 3-5 times

New engineers are placed on the manufacturing floor until first shift positions open up at which point they are competitively selected for these positions.  Shift schedule is set up as alternating day and night months of 12 hour shifts for 3/4 days/week.  There is no clear path to first shift other than making friends with the right people.  

Unless you are a bully or a yes man, this is an awful place to work.  Office politics are out of control with no clear HR role if you find yourself stuck in the middle.  Management manages through fear and manipulation.  Are not open and honest, yet claim they expect you to be; however, any negative criticisms are later used against you as ""not being a team player"" or ""having a bad attitude"".

Quality of work is not assessed, only quantity and how many emails you send out to the entire department or how many you ""reply all"" too.  Good leadership is determined by a willingness to publicly embarrass your coworkers.  There is a bias against introverts for both leadership (expected), but even technical positions as well.  So many strong but relatively quiet candidates get overlooked for promotions by the loudest person in the room and eventually get frustrated and leave.",Fab Process Engineer,Former Employee,"Manassas, VA","Sep 17, 2012"

Great benefits (both monetary/perks and wellness) and yearly employee surveys are both examples of this. Competitive salaries are a plus and the yearly market adjustment as well. Working a shift schedule means you get 3-4 days off. You can accumulate a lot of vacation time. Great focus on team member safety.,"When it comes down to it, it's still manufacturing in the high tech industry. The company goes through it's cycles of up and downs like any other tech company and everyone is aware of the potential for layoffs depending on how the market is doing. Manufacturing also means being on call 24/7 unless you're a supporting role in ""non-value added"" departments. There's a certain ceiling you hit as far as moving up. There are always job openings on the manufacturing floor but fewer job openings for 8AM to 5PM work schedule. Even if you get a position that's 8-5 it doesn't mean you' only work 8-5 because you'll be on call. Making the transition from the manufacturing floor to the office can be difficult unless you know the right people and you're a little lucky. There still exists an ""us vs. them"" mentality between those who work on the floor and those who work in the engineering offices. Life can be stressful and unpredictable. Even though you can accumulate a lot of paid time off, it doesn't mean you'll be able to use them if you're working on an important project or if another member of your team is scheduled out at the same time or if your team is severely short handed.",Anonymous Employee,Current Employee,"Manassas, VA","Aug 25, 2015"

1675,1,R&D Engineer,Boise is a small and pretty city.,"Summary:
Very poor work-life balance - Less paid off time after new CEO toke office - Seriously week technical Leads and Managers - Vey cheap culture - extremely less career development and growth opportunities - Too political 

Recent Measures:
•	With new CEO, company turn over has increased hugely, and don't be too excited if you get an offer these days, as many kids are leaving. Ask for big pay, they have no choice, possibly they will accommodate you. 
•	The new CEO has also came up with 7% layoff each year. If your manager wants to get rid of you, she/he will give you a low score, bing, you will need to go. Remember that there are no other opportunities in Boise other than Micron. For this reason, think really twice when you wana move to Idaho.

Career Opportunities:
•	There are literally fewer opportunities to move up in the company. It's heavily depends on "" like-ability"" not on your experience and qualifications. Experience and good team members’ left/leaving the team after a Non-qualified team member was assigned as lead. Shocking ... I can see this behavior across the department. 

Compensations & Benefits:
•	The pay is less than industry average. Often said Boise is a cheap city, however it's not as cheap as said at all. Recent migration from other states to Idaho has made the cost of living pretty high, housing is pricy; off course cheaper than Bay Area.
•	The new CEO has cut the 6th month bonus from last year, though company has historic revenue last year.
•	From this year, 4 of paid off days are removed from your flexible off time. The CEO office emailed us saying that “ to improve work-life balance”. Can you believe it?
•	The new policy won’t allow you to accumulate your leave for long time, you are forced to use them, or they will expire. I have heard from our international kids that this policy is hurting them a lot as they need long leave to travel and visit their family abroad. 

Work/Life Balance:
•	Though you may carry R&D title, work in here is 24/7, you get Paged almost every night. You are expected to reply Pages within 2 hours; otherwise your Manager will be Paged. The new CEO has came up with the idea of 12 months cadence, meaning product cycle is decreased from 24 month to 12 months, without increasing team members numbers.

Senior Management:
•	You will be shocked to see how poor the technical Leads and Managers are. They don't understand the technical details of your work, so won't appreciate it.

Culture & Values:
•	If you are from top 50 US universities, you will be very alone here. Kids here are from schools you haven't heard of, or some cases with no formal education. I came across a former bar tender that was teaching Engineer kids about a semiconductor tool.
•	Company has a very poor and cheap culture. Engineers are treated like kids and often managers openly say that the main responsibility of an Engineer is to make lead/manager happy, that’s it, and you guess the rest. Since you are in Idaho, you are treated like you haven’t seen decent cities or never interacted with decent people. Recently we have couple of coffee machines installed across campus; we keep getting emails from managers on how great we are and how greatly we are celebrating our success. Dude, almost every village on this Planet has coffee machine.",R&amp;D Engineer,Current Employee,"Boise, ID","Nov 27, 2018"

1753,1,Micron Manassas experience,"Micron Manassas used to be a good company and so the one star is meant for the last 2 years or so. I stayed there from 2005-2018, working on various roles from shift engineering, process, integration, quality with some reassignments at Boise, ID and Singapore ... my good experiences are summarized as follows:
- good location for single individuals or young families. Manassas in general have the worst schools and crime in the area but the adjacent 'Linton Hall' and Fairfax districts have some of the best schools.
- Proximity to Washington DC (less than an hour's drive by car). Its like living close to Paris or Rome if you were to ask me. Close to Shenandoah State Park (again, less than an hour's drive). Northern VA is good if you are into Civil War history. Drive up and down and you'll be in Pennsylvania (Amish, Gettsyburg), Maryland (National Aquarium, NASA), North Carolina (Duke Univ, beaches)... Manhattan/NYC is 6 hours' drive up north.
- peers are generally nice, helpful and work really hard. 
- they send you to vendor training and will pay for your schooling as long as it fits your job role.
- they support green card applications for foreign workers.
- generous time off hours accumulation but whether or not they will approve your leave is another question.
-good 401k match at 6%. Need 4 yrs to vest.
- good training program like process classes, statistics. mentoring culture is terrible and likely non-existent in most groups.","- salary is low if you would factor in the cost of living in the area. Northern VA is one of the most expensive in the US. $140,000/yr wont get you even a townhouse, which starts at $400,000. HOA's are another $250/mo. Of course there are cheaper options ",Senior Engineer,Former Employee,"Manassas, VA","Feb 25, 2019"

The ranking system has created a toxic work environment, lowest morale ever seen at the company.  Lot's of jobs being moved from US to overseas.  Company is very sneaky about reducing work force in such a way that layoffs don't have to be reported to reduce numbers and it's hurting talented engineers careers.  The work environment quickly changed from feeling like a career to feeling like a job.  Constructive feedback to management leads to low rankings (removal from company) and responses such as ""this is the way Micron is now"".

The company remains nearly 85% male and this sexism is furthered by promoting men to lower management positions from strongly male dominated cultures who may not even be aware they tend to promote men before women.
Micron has been working to reduce redundancy and non value tasks in Fab positions, but rarely rises to middle management jobs.  
Currently workers at the bottom of the production chain have picked up the off load of jobs from both the process and the tool sides.  MT's are now very few with generally double the workload they started with, but very very minimal increase in pay. No one knows how much work came actually correctly completed in one 12 hour shift. It seems like a strange strategy for cost cutting. Employee headcount goes down to bare bones causing their workload to increase even more, which leads to greater risk to the product and lower tool efficiency. Does eliminating low end low paying jobs save enough money to offset scrapped wafers and loss of tool production time? Even when you consider these employees are doing double duty for essentially the same pay rate?  Wouldn't retaining low cost labor instead provide an opportunity for a better distribution of work which could easily translate to less human scrap and less lost production time for tool malfunctions?
Last, it doesn't matter how hard you work, how much you know, how well you document your development, if you ask for additional responsibilities or for development opportunities to benefit your performance. There is just one person, one person who can either help you get where you really want to go or make your life so miserable you can't even let it go once you've left for the day. They can count on your participation, use you to any extent they need, but toss you off the bus solely because they like someone better, and I've seen people go just because a manager has to chop heads, and he personally prefers someone else.  How in 2017 can an international company hope to succeed when it doesn't even realize that from the top down, they promote managers who chooses  employees not for their value to the company, but in a personality contest.",Production,Current Employee,"Manassas, VA","Aug 3, 2017"

Higher management covered up this problem by reporting to the corporate that lower performers were leaving the company.

New engineers are placed on the manufacturing floor until first shift positions open up at which point they are competitively selected for these positions.  Shift schedule is set up as alternating day and night months of 12 hour shifts for 3/4 days/week.  There is no clear path to first shift other than making friends with the right people.  

Unless you are a bully or a yes man, this is an awful place to work.  Office politics are out of control with no clear HR role if you find yourself stuck in the middle.  Management manages through fear and manipulation.  Are not open and honest, yet claim they expect you to be; however, any negative criticisms are later used against you as ""not being a team player"" or ""having a bad attitude"".

Quality of work is not assessed, only quantity and how many emails you send out to the entire department or how many you ""reply all"" too.

Multiple 'clans' in the company. So called 'team work' is ganging up with your clan to outdo other clans with underhanded tactics; backstabbing, making other team members look bad, passing the buck and taking credits of others' successes.
Employees with support from senior management repeatedly bully and create hostile work environment without any consequences. 

Management in assembly and test do not walk the talk, extremely hierarchical and ignore workplace bullying. Some middle management use insulting words and yell at their employees, firefight, micro-manage, lack problem solving skills and dodge difficult questions in meetings by giggling away. 

Some key manufacturing KPI are constantly being 'altered' to appear good in reporting. Ever wonder why it's a GREAT PLACE TO WORK company but the turn over rate is high?

Multiple 'clans' in the company. So called 'team work' is ganging up with your clan to outdo other clans with underhanded tactics; backstabbing, making other team members look bad, passing the buck and taking credits of others' successes.
Employees with support from senior management repeatedly bully and create hostile work environment without any consequences. 

Management in assembly and test do not walk the talk, extremely hierarchical and ignore workplace bullying. Some middle management use insulting words and yell at their employees, firefight, micro-manage, lack problem solving skills and dodge difficult questions in meetings by giggling away.

Rather slow career advancement (this changes drastically if your bosses happen to favour you or you have a rather outstanding appearance)
Rank and yank rating practice lately introduced strikes employees’ morale pretty hard. A great deal of talents have to and are forced to go just because there has to be some ones who take home a performance rating of ‘2’ which is absurd.
Under-the-table politics and vicious peers’ competition got worse since the implementation of the rank and yank rating system. It clearly drives down the innovation capabilities and is gonna demoralise employee for a long run whereas nobody can do a damn thing about it.
New CEO seems to be turning Micron into SanDisk in every way (not likeable ways), and look what he’s got SanDisk into. LOL

Comparing to other semiconductor companies in sg, Micron is the best in terms of benefits.","Certain departments are seen as inferior despite the constant preaching of one Micron. Even the management feels the same which is not a fair view because every department has its fair share of capable employees. This leads to dissatisfaction. People lose the motivation to be at their best because once you are not part of the management’s good books/so-called star players (who are not spectacular imo), you won’t be promoted.

Management is self-serving. They just want the beautiful image/slides to present to the executives. As what another review wrote, it is more impt to look good than to be right. Chasing tails and data that is if no value.

Appraisal and employee’s surveys are done for show. Nothing would really change. 

In other companies, all employees, regardless of position levels are given the chance to travel to other sites. Here, only the management travels around. Some business travels are clearly not needed. 

Some departments get to have multiple team buildings per year while some barely had one.

Some promotions and hiring are highly doubtful. Hiring own people for political agendas when hiring could have been done in local sites for local positions. Some managers do not even have the necessary knowledge. Just pure leaching and pushing others for information.

Too much politics ongoing especially with new teams being formed to compete with each other, even though with lesser expertise just purely due to certain higher management has a say, and with most if not all the contributions being snapped
Too many central teams with a lot of manpower snapped from frontend, which comes up with ideas while the actual workload is being done by FE team, and snapping the credits
Resources are also focus on teams especially related to product development and process engineers, evaluation performance consistency is always a known issue but no concrete fix

Comparing to other semiconductor companies in sg, Micron is the best in terms of benefits.","Certain departments are seen as inferior despite the constant preaching of one Micron. Even the management feels the same which is not a fair view because every department has its fair share of capable employees. This leads to dissatisfaction. People lose the motivation to be at their best because once you are not part of the management’s good books/so-called star players (who are not spectacular imo), you won’t be promoted.

Management is self-serving. They just want the beautiful image/slides to present to the executives. As what another review wrote, it is more impt to look good than to be right. Chasing tails and data that is if no value.

Appraisal and employee’s surveys are done for show. Nothing would really change. 

In other companies, all employees, regardless of position levels are given the chance to travel to other sites. Here, only the management travels around. Some business travels are clearly not needed. 

Some departments get to have multiple team buildings per year while some barely had one.

Some promotions and hiring are highly doubtful. Hiring own people for political agendas when hiring could have been done in local sites for local positions. Some managers do not even have the necessary knowledge. Just pure leaching and pushing others for information.

Due to nature and culture of work here, everybody is more or less doing the same thing, the competition is immense due to limited opportunities to climb. every engineer is gunning for a single manageria post in his department so you imagine the stress. only 2 ladder you can climb for technical - senior eng, principal engineer.

Oh yes, beware of 1st few months of 'initation', hostility, aggression will be shown towards you by senior staff at the slightest ignorance or delay you have. I got told off right infront of everybody by senior staff within my 1st week of work. So its kinda like a 'taming' period for new hires especially those mid career ones. the fresh grads, it's easy meat for them.

for fresh grads, be prepared to organise many team building events on top of your work load.

Work colleagues become your family  and we support each other through thick and thin.","New executive and senior level management teams have resulted in a lot of change in our culture which is both good and bad.  New ideas and experience are being brought to Micron (good) but not a lot of internal promotion is taking place at the senior management levels (bad.)  Much needed building /work place updates have been made (good) but questionable spending on the design/fixtures and implementation (and re-implementation) when a simple refresh would have done the job (bad.)  

Decision making is either not done at the right level of the organization, or, decisions aren't being made at all, leaving groups spinning in circles providing data multiple times over just in a different format to help management make a decision.

Over the past couple of years Micron has used a forced distribution curve for performance ratings which has impacted the psychological safety one should feel while at work.  This has changed/is changing aspects of our culture including collaboration (people are starting to only look out for their best interest) and  transparency (people are afraid to share items for fear it will be held against them later.)",Anonymous Employee,Current Employee,,"Jun 13, 2019"
