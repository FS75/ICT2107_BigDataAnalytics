60,1,NEVER JOIN RISK PROFILE IN SEMBCORP INDIA,Work life balance since there will be no work and all life,"The cons are specific to the risk management profile in SEIL. The company otherwise is doing amazing business in renewable business in India. Talking of Risk Team, there are several reason for not joining this team: (1) Repetitive Tasks - the task performed are already work done of either commercial or corporate finance team. The team takes inputs from various teams, put the information in a PPT and forward to the board. there is no value addition of any sort except how to make lengthy ppts. (2) No direct contribution to company's balance sheet/PL (hence dont except decent increments) (3) Lethargy at the core of the team - there are no deadlines, no follow ups, no discussions, no accountability of any sorts. I was not handed over the basic documents relating to the work till 5th month from joining. (4) Unprofessional and Politics - The team have people who are in the system for the past 10-12 years, who are highly unprofessional, lacks knowledge of sector and they are very toxic. Being in system for so long they have taken over the whatever work the team gets. They will not share with some one new who joins - hence no work, no contribution, and no recognition

PLS DONT JOIN THIS TEAM. IT WILL IMPACT YOUR CAREER IN LONG RUN. I LEFT IN 6 MONTHS AFTER SUFFERING ALL OF THIS.
