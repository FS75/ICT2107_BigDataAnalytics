ii) Double standards in policies: Claims are allowed based on HR policies, but NOT encouraged by management. Stinginess is apparent in the entire company culture. Some departments do not need to have MC submitted but some do.
iii) Confusing procedures: Most of the time, middle management has no idea what is the proper process to follow. For e.g. project initiation. templates used for any form of documentation have not been updated regularly, and sometimes there are too many versions of the same document. The result is a mess of documentation submitted to various sources.
iv) Dependency on relationships rather than processes: If you are a people person with good PR skills, you would do well to survive there. But if not, too bad. Nothing will get done.
v) Middle and top management has no idea on the workload of their subordinates: They fail to understand how to measure the workload of the bottom-tier employees. There is a culture of just appointing work whenever they come without the understanding of resource capacity. The end result is a ""work-pushing"" culture due to self-defence.
vi) Management has traditional mindset and are not open minded to new ways of thinking: These are people who have been working there for over 10-20 years and believe they are elites. Times have changed, yet their minds have not. Be prepared to humor them at the expense of your dignity or have a difficult time working there.

Mentorship / Guidance

Management or depts manager do not know how to guide and groom the young. Many of them are experiences personal who spend years (long long years) on the ground learning. Their mindset are set in the similar way as their era – explore yourself in the deep ocean, see it yourself, not explaination. Even when they try to explain, it will end up as a session of boosting how good they are and how many difficult situation they solved.

Employee benefit / Concern

Management is not concern with employee working life balance, and to instill the family value of the company in you. Department annual gathering and Xmas party is the only events they have for you. What’s more! You got to play for it ranging from $80 to $150, workers too ($20-50). Imagine hows much workers are earning?

Food here sucks! 42min of lunch time (1230 to 1312). But you can only leave office at 1230? Imagine quening the only 2 stalls in the yard each for contracts and yard personal? at least 10-15min gone....To reach office by 1310 for meeting (5mins to cycle back) how much time are you left for food!?

If not, pack your lunch and eat....(5mins) and rest to sleep...
