Great opportunities for advancement. Free water. Will always get your steps in.,Really makes you question the life decisions you made that would cause you to have to make the decision to work there. The tuition reimbursement is for a Associate's degree. The work will grind your soul down to a paste. Opportunities for advancement are based on whether your have an MBA or not. The steps are about 40k for most jobs. Boring work. Tedious work that causes your brain to sleep and you miss the little details and you make mistakes and your manager writes you up. Learn how to poop and pee fast because if you get stage fright you could lose your job. Don't take longer than 6 minutes to use the bathroom. Also find a way to be a camel because when you work a 12 hour shift and you walk 50000 steps a day you need to stay hydrated but drinking the 100 oz of recommended water will obviously make you pee a lot and often.

263,3.0,"Great if you're lucky, brutal if not","If you're a high performer and on a team with a good culture, this is a great place to be. Managers are encouraged to develop your career and promote on criteria that aim to be as objective as possible. 

The people who work here are super sharp, and there are hard problems to solve. You'll learn a lot here and have a huge impact.

The pay is great but highly dependent on stock. 

My managers have generally been supportive of me expensing technical books to help grow my skills. I also got to go to an expensive tech conference one time.","If you get unlucky, you might wind up on a team where the norm is to overwork, and you'll feel obligated to do the same. 

Some projects are cared about more by leadership, and then extreme pressure cascades down to meet deadlines.

Sometimes you'll wind up doing more politics and negotiating than coding, like if you work on something that impacts or requires help from other teams.

Leadership is increasingly non technical. Upper leadership is starting to seem more like 'most popular kid in high school' instead of 'smartest kid in high school'. And there are some complete, total jerks in leadership. Everyone in leadership there is brilliant, and some are kind, but some are really rule-by-terror style. This made me feel that I would never have what it takes to be in that level of leadership at Amazon.

I wish the company offered more time off.

Kindness, empathy, and collaboration are undervalued here. They are glaringly absent from the leadership principles, even after the recent new additions. As a result, people coming in who are abrasive and hostile don't learn any better, so long as they're 'delivering results'. Some of the people who I've seen promoted to L6, which is supposed to be a leadership and role model position, are such complete jerks that I feel something very important is missing from promotion guidelines.

Sometimes the tech work is really unglamorous, like a version upgrade that would be simple at a smaller company but is a year of bureaucracy and slogging through slow builds at Amazon, or having to use very outdated programming languages, or using weird internal frameworks rather than something industry standard.",Sr. Software Engineer,Former Employee,"Seattle, WA","Sep 4, 2022"

Salary is stock heavy (30-50% stock) which can be a pro or a con depending on the market. Total comp is slightly competitive if the market is high but base is very low.

321,2.0,"Flex-PT Packer, it was mid","The job was simple, I was a packer and because I was part-time and flex schedule, I only had to make up a minimum of 4 hours a week which was easy. I never got trained or asked to do another function because I was rarely there so days I did work were chill and easy. I had the option of doing full shifts (8 hours, or 10 at some) or half shifts (3 hours and 30 mins, or 4 hours and 30 mins, and in some 5 hrs). I generally did about 12-20 hours every week and it came with 401k benefits, PTO, and an 8 point attendance system. They also offer premiums of 2-5 dollars on some shifts which is a good way a making lots of money but with shorter shifts.","They only offer good flexible hours during peak, outside of that season you only get hours of shifts that you typically pick, (so if you generally do nights, they’ll only start offering night shifts but if you wanted to switch to mornings, which being flex you should have the ability to do so, you won’t be able too because they do not give you the option too. It’s vice versa for days). They also try to make you vto on days you do come in even though you are already doing the least amount of hours possible, if you don’t, they illegally try to force you to do another function. You have to take care of your of your attendance for carefully because they try to give you a point for everything even if it is not a violation, and when you try to get it fixed, HR takes forever and sometimes does not even understand, or refuses to read cases. They will close your case without fixing anything, then you have to go back and open it again and basically keep doing that until they fix your issue. And they are suppose to update you if you hit 8 points which qualifies you for termination, but they do not always do that, (I was fired because I was not warned that I had 8 points, and because they did not even give me a week to deal with it, it boot me out of A to Z and making a case was the hardest thing ever). If you are there a lot, management will take advantage of you and try to harass you in the most subtle ways possible, they really try to condescend you. A MAJORITY OF HR PEOPLE DO NOT KNOW AMAZON POLICY OR STATE LABOR LAWS, and will break them consistently.

There's really no sales involved here because specialists demo products and do the actual selling. Your job is to schedule meetings, update SFDC, navigate literally hundreds of resource pages to find information, and do whatever your field rep asks.

Many new managers have been promoted for the sake of diversity and/or time at the company. Unfortunately, they are often not yet qualified for the role, which has negatively impacted the teams they manage.

Core amazon systems were built quickly, not for longevity. They have become so complex that most of our time must be spent on maintenance and upkeep. The independently-empowered-team organizational structure, intended for agility and innovation, have become a hindrance more than a help because leadership has not evolved the org as the company has grown.

Fair(ish) pay - If you're coming into Amazon in a more professional role, you typically will be paid more if you're an external hire vs. an internal hire/transfer.

Growth & Upward Mobility - Being such a large company, there are venues and areas to grow into that wouldn't be possible at other corporations. If you're at Amazon for 2 years, you can apply & transfer to any role in the company regardless of collegiate degree requirements. I think that's pretty cool.","Fair(ish) pay - If you're coming into Amazon in a more professional role, you typically will be paid more if you're an external hire vs. an internal hire/transfer. I put this on both the pros/cons because it's frustrating when you work really hard to get promoted, and then an external hire comes in probably making more than you with less Amazon experience.

If you do well in ambiguity, then you will have 1000 ideas from the 1st week itself to make things better here . The fast environment and your smart colleagues will create a very conducive environment for that 
3) my team and manager very much believe in work life balance. This was one of my greatest fear while joining Amazon from hearing to people’s experience. But thankfully my team has a good work life balance. It is very important to ask work hours, on call support needed etc during interview final or after you receive offer to eliminate any surprises/ shocks . Amazon hiring managers are very transparent about the team’s working hours needs.","1) I was leading projects / programs within 1 month joining Amazon although my manager did not give any deliverable but the competitive environment and fast moving projects make you perform best , cons of it is you yourself take unnecessary pressure for the fear of missing out or to prove your skill. So it is important to know how and when to draw the line else there is high chance of burn out . Remind yourself this everyday 
2) things move very fast and you need to be always ready to take fast actions . Sometimes you will do very well and sometimes you will fail to take best decisions .

778,5.0,Great resume/experience builder,"Solid pay for what you do day-to-day - to be honest, you mainly fix printers, scanners, and laptops. You are required to have more in-depth networking knowledge incase something happens, ie WAN troubleshooting when something goes down, but they have other teams that handle the actual in-depth stuff. During the interview I thought I would be doing more in depth networking/configurations on equipment, but day to day it is fixing printers and supporting the hardware onsite + the warehouse. Still great experience and a good resume builder for those wanting to move up in IT, and you can move internally within the company - unlimited potential if you put the work in/gain certifications and knowledge for other roles, ex can move to software, AWS, security or the network development team, Amazon has everything - and they don't restrict you, you can move internally after about 3 months or transfer for any reason. It's very nice in that aspect - I've had other jobs where you have to wait a full year before being able to transfer.","Rotating on-call - only in 4 day intervals (depending on area), but if you don't like the idea of having to be on-call and being responsible for bringing the site back up at any given hour/driving 3 hours to a site at 2am, do not recommend - also, if you quit before the full year you have to pay back your bonus at a prorated rate, so if you end up not liking the idea of on-call (which many don't) you're kind of stuck. They have other jobs without on-call requirements at a similar level/better pay band.
Big pay discrepancy's between internal and external hires which leads to massive resentment of long term employees, which really brings down moral/leads to people who don't care anymore.
Another cons is that you're not working on the networking equipment, so if you dont use it you really lose it. After about 6 months I felt I learned as much as I could in the role and it started becoming stale.

794,2.0,Downhill From the Beginning,- Excellent pay and benefits,"- Higher ups insist on unrealistic standards
- Most managers are brought in from outside instead of being hired within the 
 company and this leads to people being in charge who lack knowledge 
 of how the work floor operates. While there are inside people who have 
 managed to get into higher positions, they are usually still below the 
 managers.
- Disorganized leadership
- Very minimal training
- Some of the management will make up rules that don't exist to scare their 
 subordinates into behaving
- Very monotonous and unstimulating work
- Spends more energy enforcing nonsensical rules as opposed to just changing 
 them slightly in order to make it easier for people to follow them.
 Ex: You don't get your full paid break. They expect you to stop your break 
 early and start walking back to your work station. Obviously, a lot of people 
 ignore this rule because they want their full break and instead of just giving 
 people a grace period so that travel time is not included in the actual break, 
 they will write people up for not being back on time.

 to write you up for not doing well in that area",Warehouse Associate,Former Employee,"Cleveland, OH","Aug 26, 2022"

I injured myself while working. The ""Onsite Medical Representative"" gave me bio-freeze and encouraged me to just keep working instead of getting myself evaluated by a doctor. During my shift the next day I went back to ""Amcare"" to say that my body still felt like something was wrong. I was sent to an understaffed Concentra Urgent Care where I waited 3 hours before being seen. The total length of my first visit ended up being 6 hours with all the waiting. Health provider said I had a potential hernia, put me on physical therapy and light duty for 3 weeks. Got passed around between different doctors, physical therapists, and physician assistants at these Concentras (I could not choose my own doctor).

After 3 weeks, I was finally sent to get a CT scan to check for a hernia. The CT did not show anything, but I still had ongoing pain and weakness from my injury not yet being fully healed. The internal medicine doctor and physical therapy assistant assigned to my case (Amazon's workers' compensation did NOT get me fully-credentialed staff specialized for injury care; no orthopedic sports medicine specialists, no actual doctor of physical therapy) talked to each other and decided that I should go back to work while still injured because their deal with Amazon specified that injuries such as mine only be allowed 3 weeks and nothing more for healing.

It is very slow and outside of the first trainer, the people hired to train struggle with reading the material and articulating what should be thought. Th first 5 hour training session was beyond agonizing. Also, there are lots of bosses and very little workers. What I mean is that there are a lot of blue vests who do little work but certainly know how to point out to others what pallet to take, make or where to be. It is quite demoralizing. In addition, instead of having set break schedules you have to wait for someone to tell you when to take a break, and it varies each day.

917,4.0,"Very Straightforward, Easy Job Overall","Amazon incorporates a ""flex-up flex-down"" system. This means that if there's not enough work to be done, everyone is allowed to leave up to an hour early (or even eariler occasonially). If there's a lot of work to be done, everyone has to stay an extra hour; but worry not, you get paid for that extra hour. 

Near the end of a shift, they will also provide the option for you to leave early if the workload decreases enough to justify doing so. This option is on a ""first come first-served"" basis, so keep an ear out for the opprotunity if you want to leave early. However, know that you get paid less for leaving early.

After about three months of working in an Amazon Sort Center, you get to modify your shift to your liking if there are empty shifts availible.

The break times are sufficient and the vending machines have decent food; chocolates, candy, sweet, savory.","In order to keep track of the diligent workers from the slackers, Amazon tracks the scanners of the appropiate workers. They record how many boxes you scanned per minute. This means that if you scan at a fast rate, then are later directed by a leader to load the trailers, the rate will go down.

The following week or so, you will be questioned on why your rate is low, then you'll have to tell the inquiring leader that another leader told you to do another task. Supposedly, the person directing you to the other task is supposed to scan your bagde when you switch so that management knows this. However, this never happens in reality. Instead, you are rushed to your new task, leading to multiple unncessary interrogations.

Another con: lack of consistancy. When I first started working at the job, only people who where ""cross-docked trained"" could load the trailers. Then, all of a sudden, everyone could,. Then, only those trained could.

Also, you will keep getting questions on whether you are trained for a certain position.

Finance uses outdated and cumbersome financial reporting systems, paired with much-too frequent reporting cycles. The company's product development decisions are driven by narrative docs that incentivize telling a compelling story over building a solid business case based on data analysis and diverse thought. Speed is more important than accuracy. 
 Deliverables and timelines come out of nowhere and are at the whim of your VP, where months of challenging work to prepare for a meeting can be made worthless at the literal last minute.

You can learn all about AWS services here with free AWS account. If you are the learner, you will love that.
The best thing about Amazon is you can enjoy health insurance (including dental and vision) from the day one you joined.","You can be overwhelmed by the information. If you don't know how to own up your time, you will be drowned in every growing invites and trainings.

999,3.0,"Hard, but sometimes worth it",Good for development: It's an easy place to get meaningful experience quickly because they're so large and need so many people that it's a matter of if and not when opportunities will come your way.,"Terrible work-life balance: This is something which they're currently pushing hard to move away from, but the phrase ""Amazon is where over-achievers go to feel bad about themselves"" may as well be an axiom. Whatever you do, it will never be enough. It's an admirable trait and standard for an individual to have and hold themselves to, but less great coming from every single person above you, no matter how high you go. It will become stressful and potentially depressing.

Pay: Pay can be good for some positions and is generally better for those who join Amazon after they've built up some experience, but for those moving within the Amazon ladder, typically the earlier in your career you joined the lower on the pay-scale you will be even as you move up.

Culture: Within Amazon you 1) learn by doing, and 2) learn on your own. Learning by doing is great, but the learning on your own is a result of schadenfreude that other Amazonions feel it seems. It's often a struggle to come into a role and the mindset I've seen across several teams now is that to help others and improve their learning curve would put the new talent ahead of them and make their struggle meaningless. It's a shame, but it's the reality of this company.",Senior Account Manager,Current Employe,"Seattle, WA","Nov 1, 2021"
