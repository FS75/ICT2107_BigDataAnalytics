1,3.0,How much does a functioning human cost?,"- Paycheck
- So many good people
- Such a great service
- Hope","I have been working for a year at Netflix.

I've seen what was supposed to be very mature people, sharing absolutely almost no contact that anyone would qualify as ""human"".
Sure, that sounds hyperbolic, let me develop (and maybe cherry-pick a little).

Have you heard about our culture? The one about giving candid feedback? - I have seen people complaining of behavior they literally demonstrated themselves in the following days.
But I have also seen these feedbacks resulting in tears both in the eyes of HR persons or fellow engineers. How human does that sound?

Have you heard about our culture? The one about not tolerating brilliant jerks? I have nonetheless seen angriness and frustration, expressed in private, public and meeting. People rejecting new ideas by default, like, any ideas they wouldn't have worked themselves on for days wouldn't count. Even if those ideas are from the best examples in the industry or academics. How many publications/contributions have you seen from Netflix to computer science in general? How does it compare against any other company of that size in the Bay Area? Can you imagine either the real insecurity (x)or the lack of innovation that could lead to this situation?

Except for a few managers, directors or VPs feeling free enough to behave at work in the same way than how they live, almost every engineer I have been interacting with, have shared as little as possible about their private life.
The rare exceptions of interpersonal exchange ends up around some sort of competitive behavior: Who is the most geeky, sportive, owns the fastest car/biggest house/visited the strangest place.

I've heard workaholic people complaining about ambitious peers who were over-managing, over-working to get even more work to do after. I feel like we're past workaholism at this point.

Maybe there are a lot of shy people! Maybe there is a culture of fear, not only of being fired, but also a fear of interacting with people going to be fired.
Maybe it's all in my head, maybe people giving 5 stars to their experience here don't care the human aspect of a company. And maybe they're right.

What about your crush, your fears, your desires for the future, your appetite for life? I've been blessed to work in enough large companies to know that the behavior that I'm seeing in Netflix is not a healthy one. I've also been lucky enough to work in other industries more socializing than tech and I can tell that Netflix has a lot to do on that side, and off-sites or team meeting won't solve that problem.

I am afraid about the tragic, but inevitable consequences of the ways people operate in this company: I guess that the day the worst will happen, it will be addressed in an impersonal memo by Reed; followed-up by 1 or 2 reminders during offsites. Possibly commented by HR in a Q&A document. And move on. This company seems as reactive in its management of people as it is proactive in its business operations.

I still work at Netflix though, not only for the paycheck, but because I hope. I hope it will change. The needed change can't happen from a candid feedback, a Q&A, or  only from inside.
Change has to come from everyone, including people who take time to read comments like this one. Netflix has so many good people and offers such a great service.

As a curious Netflix employee reading this review: think about your past, isn't there a big human thing that you would love to feel again in your current company that you've felt in the past?

As a candidate: think about what would be a good question to ask to that HR partner once your package is almost here to be offered to you, think about that comment you make at the end of an interview when you're being asked by an engineer: ""Do you have any question for me?""
What Netflix needs is an inception, something that anyone and everyone would think about after leaving the call or the room they were sharing with you.
Ask yourself, and then the others, the question you should ask if you think you want to spend a good amount of your life and energy in the place you're applying for.

- Will I learn and contribute to the knowledge of other's? Even outside the company?
- Will I see emotional responses from my peers? Will that be for other reasons than being fired or bluntly criticized?
- Will I find a friendly environment that will nurture my appetite for life?
- What is the amount of emotional interaction (celebrating, sharing, playing) to expect from a company whose service is the best to ""entertain""?
- Do androids dream of electric sheep?",Anonymous Employee,Current Employe,,"Sep 20, 2018"
2,5.0,"high performing environment, fantastic benefits, trust and results earn a lot of freedom","great benefits, best salary around, beautiful offices and you will work amongst some of the smartest folks you have ever met, plus you are talking about tv and movies all day - it's a FUN job","the company has grown rapidly over the last few years and during covid - the previous way of onboarding and building trust was much harder to achieve. I was at Netflix new many growth phases and this one is definitely the hardest - there are a ton of talent people in the marketing department that have been there a long time (e.g. more than 4 years) but not a lot of upward mobility so it feels like folks are getting restless. It has also become a much more political environment where it feels like leadership is most focused on decision making based on perception vs. what is best for the work and the teams. If you are a used to a political environment, this may not bother you.",Marketing Director,Former Employee,"Los Angeles, CA","Jan 30, 2023"
3,3.0,Netflix is not for everybody,"The best part about Netflix is that they try to pay 20% more than everybody else, so the compensation is good.  They are not shy about spending money, so travel is business class, you'll get a new MacBook Pro every year, etc.  The people there tend to be very nice, the catered lunch is delicious, and so forth.  While there is still a lot of action in Los Gatos building the technology (although arguably it is becoming mature, as streaming is a commodity), the real drama is in Los Angeles, relating to content.","Netflix has very strange politics, because people's jobs are at the whim of their manager.  In other words, if a manager decides that a particular report is no longer a ""star,"" he or she will get a package.  So, given that employees are not stupid, there is a lot of kissing up, resulting in a lot of comedy.  Netflix believes in ""360 feedback,"" but everybody I know only does that to their peers, and they become very political with their management chain.",Senior Software Engineer,Current Employee,"Los Gatos, CA","May 22, 2019"

5,4.0,"Still a great company, but losing it's magic","Netflix is unlike any other company I've worked at. There's a level of trust that you don't see at other companies, and the people you work with all tend to be senior-level and very capable. Because of that, there hasn't been a hierarchy among IC's; everyone leads projects and functions as a trusting peer with everyone else. It's also always been a pretty lean company with process where it's needed but not the influence of politics and bureaucracy. But both of those are slowly changing, and I fear it will soon become like every other tech company. Another pro is that the compensation is 100% salary (no bonuses or forced RSU's), and thankfully that's not changing.","Inconsistency in management across the company, the addition of levels among ICs could hinder collaboration as not everyone will be equals and a hierarchy will be created, the possible introduction of a location-based salary adjustment is unjustified (output stays the same, the company saves money with so many working remotely). Internal communication has been horrible lately, which is sad and frustrating for a company that prides itself on being open and transparent.",Product Designer,Current Employee,,"Nov 20, 2022"

- Every IC is the same title so you can be in a room with folks who have been at the company for 10-15 years, or are giants in the industry, and your voice is heard at the same pitch as theirs.
- Fantastic engineering culture so, along with outputting good work, you also get to learn the right and wrong way to solve a problem.
- Data drives features and everything is A/B tested, so you know why your feature made it out or didn't.
- One of the best compensation in the Valley with an unheard of compensation strategy (personal top of market is the most rational way to pay people for their work).
- Expense whatever you need to help you do your job better, as long as you're practicing responsibility.
- Brand recognition","- Ecosystem is massive so it's hard to know how to do everything.
- Little documentation so it's hard to know how something works adhoc (you have to go to the team and ask questions).
- Because everyone is at the same title, growth is horizontal (you will build skills but not climb the ladder). You need to work with your manager to draw a goal plan.
- Outside perspective of Netflix culture is that it's ""cutthroat""; which is not the right word. It's ""lean"" - meaning there isn't room for folks to coast.

2. Exciting company doing great things
3. Smart people","1. Definitely a culture of fear. People are let go constantly if they're not performing. The company is very open about this part of their culture, so just know what you're getting in to.
2. Company used to have a very strong culture (read their culture memo). That culture has evolved and, in the opinion of many people who've been there for a while, eroded. People regularly ignore key principles of the culture. Part of it is due to the company's rapid growth. Netflix with 8000 employees is very different from Netflix with 1000 employees 6-7 years ago. That level of rapid growth seriously diluted the culture.
3. Much less freedom & responsibility than in the past. Becoming more bureaucratic and political.
4. Much less forthright and candid from management. For example, management recently got rid of the 5% free options. Management framed it as more choice for employees (as the 5% free options were converted to cash salary, which employees can then allocate to options if they want), but as the comp philosophy of top of market typically didn't take into account the 5% free options, employees viewed this move as management disingenuously reducing salaries by 5%.

289,3.0,"The best job I've had, and at times, the worst job I've had","Netflix has some great pros. You'll be working with mostly extremely competent people. Dealing with teams within the company is extremely easy, as most people are very helpful and efficient. They pay you a lot of money, and give you perks like free food, paid cell phone bill, 401k, etc. This is all great, but for me, the biggest draw is always people, and your team will make or break your experience here, so make sure you know what you are getting into at the interview, and don't accept jobs with teams that you don't feel excited about being part of.","The high salary leads some people to ramp up their lifestyles, they then become dependent on being here. This in turn creates a culture of fear where people are constantly stressing out that they are ""not doing enough"" and might be fired any minute. This also extends to the directors of teams, and when your management is stressed, it will always trickle down to create a lousy experience for you.
This makes for an extremely toxic environment at times where teams are often working on similar projects, thus competing against each other to stay relevant, which is just utter idiocy. The high pay ensures that there is way more politicking than would be needed or appropriate in such situations. This in turn can have a very demoralizing effect on the peons doing the actual work, who often feel compelled to work on nights, weekends and public holidays for goals that are often vague, and projects that are often shelved. The most insidious effect of this is observed when people contemplate taking PTO, when many employees have told me that they weren't able to relax or take as much time off as they needed, as they were constantly wondering what would happen to their jobs, and whether or not they were doing enough to ""deserve"" time off.

Many times, I've felt the need to quit the field altogether, but the money and my team makes me stay for now, so I'll likely stay till my team changes.

Moral of the story here is: You'll get paid a lot. You'll also likely be laid off sooner than you expect. You'll also likely make a LOT less at your next place.

Dealing with teams within the company is extremely easy, as most people are very helpful and efficient. They pay you a lot of money, and give you perks like free food, paid cell phone bill, 401k, etc. This is all great, but for me, the biggest draw is always people, and your team will make or break your experience here, so make sure you know what you are getting into at the interview, and don't accept jobs with teams that you don't feel excited about being part of.","The high salary leads some people to ramp up their lifestyles, they then become dependent on being here. This in turn creates a culture of fear where people are constantly stressing out that they are ""not doing enough"" and might be fired any minute. This also extends to the directors of teams, and when your management is stressed, it will always trickle down to create a lousy experience for you.
This makes for an extremely toxic environment at times where teams are often working on similar projects, thus competing against each other to stay relevant, which is just utter idiocy. The high pay ensures that there is way more politicking than would be needed or appropriate in such situations. This in turn can have a very demoralizing effect on the peons doing the actual work, who often feel compelled to work on nights, weekends and public holidays for goals that are often vague, and projects that are often shelved. The most insidious effect of this is observed when people contemplate taking PTO, when many employees have told me that they weren't able to relax or take as much time off as they needed, as they were constantly wondering what would happen to their jobs, and whether or not they were doing enough to ""deserve"" time off.

372,2.0,Tread Carefully,"- Pay. Unequivocally the best in town. Full stop. 
- Travel & Expense Policy. Nowhere else will you be allowed to effectively do whatever you want, with limited oversight and an occasional audit. Need to fly business? Book business. Need to stay in a swanky hotel. Stay in said swanky hotel. Just don't abuse it.
- Uber/Shuttles. Pre-Pandemic, of course, the company Uber account to/from work is a nice touch, though it's not great they add it to your taxable income without telling you about it. They also have shuttles all over LA to pick you up and drive you to and fro.
- Family Planning allowance. Real big high five for the $75k contribution to family planning, fertility, what have you.","- So. Many. Feelings. Good lord, be adults and do some actual work.
- Meeting-heavy culture. Every 30min chunk of your day will be full and you will get nothing done. Prepare to turn on and work late once you've eaten dinner or your kids go to bed. They know it and do nothing about it.
- Work life balance. You have no life anymore, there is only Netflix.
- Reorganizations are constant. If you want a comfortable existence in your role this is not the place for you.
- Leadership changes are constant. Since senior leadership does very little in the day to day work of building campaigns or managing talent, they make their hay moving people around the chess board like little pawns to justify their existence and politicking to get Ted's ear. It's gross, and the string of senior marketing departures validates its grossness. 
- Content is king. The Content Org that is. They can spend 20billion to make content, while Marketing panhandles on the side of the 101 for loose change to cut trailers, execute photo shoots, or do anything innovative. 
- Campaigns are teeny tiny. Unless you're a Ryan Reynolds movie, Stranger Things, or Bridgerton, you aren't getting a campaign; more a loose collection of assets geared toward keeping your talent happy. So if you're looking to build big, integrated, global campaigns, this likely isn't the place for you. Which is hard because...
- Ted promises talent a lot! So the Content and Marketing teams are between a rock and a hard place, as no one wants to tell them they aren't getting real campaigns, only token media spends and creative budgets.
- God help you if you work on a Season 2 or Sequel+. You're working with pocket lint and thoughts and prayers for resources. 
- The Culture. For a company famous for its Culture Deck, they've really let it fall by the wayside in most departments. Gone is critical, real time feedback. Gone is the pro sports team mentality. Gone is any real sense of Risk Taking or Innovation. It also is whatever anyone in Senior Leadership or HR says that it is to achieve whatever reorg or budget shortfall that's coming.
- There's no upward mobility and very little that goes into training/development. Raises are non-existent unless you go get an offer from elsewhere, in which case you're playing Russian Roulette with the ""Keeper Test.""

Also the hiring process was deceiving - they promised a great role with salary which has different benefits than hourly employees , then proceeded to demand references including my employer at the time BEFORE sending me their offer. I had to basically announce I was leaving to my former boss of over 2 years (with no choice) before even having an offer letter and they then had the audacity to reduce my role and benefits to an hourly role with brief apology.

Employees on your team are not afraid to give you feedback which is encouraged in the workplace. Whether you are an assistant giving feedback to a director or the other way around , everyone is more or else walking on egg shells. 

Very little training and everyone expects you to be a top performer. There is the expression “drinking from the fire hose” , literally blasting you with information everyday. I was expected to support a director running a 15 person team perfectly after 1 week of questionable training. 

Also the hiring process was deceiving - they promised a great role with salary which has different benefits than hourly employees , then proceeded to demand references including my employer at the time BEFORE sending me their offer. I had to basically announce I was leaving to my former boss of over 2 years (with no choice) before even having an offer letter and they then had the audacity to reduce my role and benefits to an hourly role with brief apology.

The company was constantly innovating and looking for ways to improve, so you never felt like you were sitting still.  Perks and compensation were also the best I've experienced in my career.","Due to rapid growth over the 4 years I was there, perhaps a little bit of the culture was lost or watered down, mostly in terms of feeling like you perhaps knew fewer people as the company grew.

Altho, I hear this is changing and Netflix will only give you a raise if you can find someone in the Bay Area with the exact title and responsibilities who make more.  Contrary to the buzz about Netflix being a tech innovator, it's become a ""Hollywood"" company.  What drives Netflix is  the Netflix ""produced"" shows; not the ""innovative"" streaming technology - Hollywood runs Netflix; not Los Gatos.","Since many people are only at Netflix for the higher than average salary, there is a culture of fear whereby people are constantly worried about their employment status in the company and will, unfortunately, submit to their baser instincts to do whatever it takes to keep their job.  As for a high-performing culture, I guess it's relative but I've worked with much much more talented people elsewhere.  Netflix is a great place if you are average and are able to keep upper management for figuring out that you are just average and are willing to do whatever it takes to keep up that facade.

615,5.0,An incredible environment that will definitely make you grow as a professional,"I have worked for Netflix for 3 years. As most of reviews say, it is incredible to see how open and honest the culture is. The company is still pretty flat for its size, and you can feel your impact on initiatives you work on. Development moves very fast and our cycles are short and iterative. Multiple 6-month long projects in other companies get out the door in a matter of a few weeks.

I definitely feel like reviews on Glassdoor do not make justice to the Netflix environment. Yes, there is a lot of work, but I do not feel people get let go all the time, or that anyone would feel scared of being fired without reason. People do not get let go without fair warning. Everyone I know that has been let go so far saw it coming and recognizes it is the best for both them and the company. I find it hard to believe sometimes we have to overcome people's fears in that aspect. And newcomers realize very fast there is a myth and feel great to have joined. 

In short, it is a remarkable, fair and candid company and I am thrilled to have joined and I plan to go nowhere in the next 5 years.","I agree there is no career plan or defined development, but then again, this translates into a lot of freedom to forge your own path.

Zero tolerance to even small mistakes - you're expected to work as a perfect robot. If you made a mistake you're out immediately, no chance for correction.
Zero communications about your performance - it is all up to management to decide how you're doing. So you don't know whether you made or making mistakes.
Project management does not exist, hence no planning is happening, just loose email exchanges.
You don't feel as part of the team, there are virtually no teams, just people trying to prove something and keep their jobs.

Netflix makes no secret about it's high performance culture, which results in a very high turnover.

There are conflicting values and many managers don't practice what Netflix preaches. If you associate with the right people, this can help your career, but it is disappointing that office politics factors so heavily into a company that preaches how different they are from other corporate cultures.

There's a major disconnect between HR/WFM and what actually happens on the floor, and often we are given no context as to why decisions negatively impacting us are made.

The center here in SLC has also stopped promoting people internally- a majority (if not all) of the supervisors in the last several months were hired externally.

- outstanding colleagues
- outstanding perks
- pay
- everyone is open and willing to share their work and knowledge
- great cross department and team collaboration 

I’ve been here for a while now and the honey moon stage still hasn’t worn off. I’d say a lot of the negative reviews are customer service related and they’re not a good indicator of our corporate environment.","There are no cons to working here.

679,1.0,Customer service representative,The culture is wonderful the management make it hard to be there. There is free s snacks and plenty of training but there is zero follow through on the floor.,"The customer DOES NOT come first. “ say what you have to, get them off the phone” we literally were told to lie on a daily basis. All “soups” and their management are uneducated, therefore; all laws set into place to protect employees are completely ignored. If something is said then there will be retaliation is a huge part of the “I” which is wrong 
Example: no restroom break, you ask you get told no. You go anyway so you don’t get yourself “dirty” you get pulled in a conference room and talked too.
- breastfeeding is a no no too, there’s no place to go and it needs to be done in a certain amount of time and at a certain time. There are things you can’t rush!!
- you don’t get paid for coming in. You only get paid when you’ve gone through 4 screens to open that special window to beck It’s always slow and they get angry that we’ve clocked in late. There’s 2 choice pay the extra 3 minutes or don’t complain that were not logged in on time.
- young and cute, you can do whatever you want
- mature people that have amazing statistics and 
quality ratings aren’t recognized.",,Former Employe,,"Feb 22, 2019"
680,4.0,"Strong company for self- starters, Call Center needs work","Focused on individuals who can self manage and get their work done.
Netflix has nice in -house perks: the movies, etc and pretty good benefits & vacation.
Fast paced change.","Not clear goal setting or expectations from senior directors or management - and when something does come down the pipe then it tends to be a bit frantic and ""get it done now"" instead of always doing comprehensive future planning.
Call center managers all have very different management personalities and don't seem to be as calibrated on aspects - which then reflects out the the floor and floor then tends to think that the managers who are more ""hard line"" and terminate more are the ""favorites"" of upper management. 
Change that happens has positive end results, but transitions & communication to the call center floor are not done as well or as immediate as they could be.",Manager,Current Employe,"Hillsboro, OR","Mar 5, 2009"
681,5.0,"A culture of high performance can be daunting for some, but worth it.","High performance environment - you're given a huge amount of responsibility and ownership to drive your work. You're able to see the direct impact you're making to the company, as a result. 

The company is incredibly transparent -- everyone in the company, no matter the ""level,"" could tell you our business direction.

Stunning colleagues. High bar for hiring, so you're working amongst smart, driven, and passionate folks.","High-performance environment -- expectations are high and you run full-speed, most of the time.

682,5.0,Talent,"The interview process at Netflix was extremely enjoyable, I felt respected, inspired, and appreciated by all of the interviewers I spoke with. The process took 3 weeks in total and they were extremely accommodating when I shared that I had other offers I was considering within a deadline. I decided Netflix was the company I wanted to work for because of that great candidate experience during the interview process, highly intelligent people I interacted with along the way, unique and inspiring culture perspective and opportunity for my career. The culture at Netflix is like no other, it is a supportive environment where the best people can really grow, challenge one another, and bring new ideas to fruition. I am encouraged to share my experiences, opinions, feedback whenever possible and as a result you feel extremely valued as an employee. I look forward to coming in to work everyday and being surrounded by stunning colleagues!",I really don't have any cons!,Anonymous Employee,Current Employe,,"Nov 7, 2017"
683,5.0,Best place I've ever worked,"""Freedom and Responsibility"" rings mostly true, although you'd have to be stupid to not realize it isn't 100% true always and in everything. Simple, indisputable example: you can't decide how much you make, yourself. That's an obvious statement, yet it proves there definitely are no-goes and as such, gray areas. In practice, it hasn't been an issue for me--just clarifying. You want X number of monitors, Y super-amazing-computer, come in at 11am, leave at 4pm, take numerous vacations, ask (and receive a real answer!) dang near anything about what movies/shows they're secretly bidding on in Hollywood, etc, etc. Not only things a reasonable person would want to do/have, more like a well spoiled person. This all assumes you are communicating this with your team and performing well above average--Netflix does *not* knowingly hire junior, mid-level, or wannabe-senior engineers. I haven't personally seen a bunch of people get fired, but of the one or two I've seen, it was not surprising. I have noticed some teams are more critical of performance than others.

Like any company of a decent size, not every team has exactly the same culture. Mine was absolutely wonderful day-to-day. My managers help you and coordinate, more than ""manage"" me, which is huge just by itself. To this point, most engineering managers I know of aren't really programmers, which I think is a huge bonus because there is far less risk of them wanting to micromanage projects and implementation details. That said, they are ALL very very technical and  can fairly trivially smell BS.

Salary: you'll be more than happy as far as I've heard from co-workers. For me, they made it impossible for me to ever even consider leaving because of salary. Almost every place I've worked prior, I had at some point felt underpaid. Not here, I felt very much appreciated and paid as such.

Summary: YMMV, like in every big company, but seriously that's super important to understand, but my experience was amazing and by far the best place I've ever worked, all things considered. I left for personal reasons that aren't related to Netflix--wife/family stuff.","If you're not a high performer, but you manage to sneak in, the fear of being canned could certainly be real since YOU WILL inevitably be discovered. But don't second guess yourself. It should be obvious whether or not you are a high performer.

Sometimes discussions on the Freedom and Responsibility culture turns sort of cult-like. With a select number of people, questioning its real-world implications has been met with very clear disgust, almost denial. Very rare, though. For me was trivial to brush off.",Anonymous Employee,Former Employe,,"Aug 17, 2015"
684,5.0,My 2 Years at Netflix...,"I just hit my 2 year mark at Netflix, and it has been great thus far. It has been quite the whirlwind and learning experience, and I continue to be challenged every day. The partnerships I have formed are immeasurable, and to be involved with a company changing the way entertainment content is consumed is pretty exciting. 

Biggest pro in my eyes to working here has been the people. My colleagues truly are ""stunning"" as the culture deck highlights. Really some of the best in the business, and everyone I collaborate with has a clear passion and drive for their work. 

Although we move at lightning speed, it pushes me to excel, and not simply coast through the day to day grind.",Sometimes we forget to celebrate/recognize our major accomplishments because we are always moving towards the next best thing.,,Current Employe,"Los Gatos, CA","Oct 15, 2015"
685,2.0,Be prepared to sell your soul...,"Free unlimited movie rentals
Good Pay for the area
Unlimited vacation - there is a caveat to this
You can say you worked in the movie industry","Never being treated as a human being was my main complaint. The turnover was and still is ridiculously high. The ""no rules"" culture sounds good on paper, but in practice is awful because there is never any true direction. Employees are held to a certain expectation but are never told what that expectation is. The unlimited vacation also sounds good on paper, but it is almost impossible to take time off. They deliberately keep the employees in the dark and then chastise and even terminate their employment doing something wrong. It felt like upper management just did things to cover their backside and let everyone else take the fall when things weren't going as planned. There was no development of people whatsoever.",Manager,Former Employe,"Hillsboro, OR","Jul 22, 2009"
686,3.0,Officially a big company,"Great pay, free lunches, flexible hours, no weekends, brilliant co-workers","I have worked for Netflix for several years and I can honestly say that a lot of the groups now including where I was has started managing up.  The transparency is slowly eroding. Opinions are still accepted but disregarded under the guise of management speak.  Quality is no longer a standard for shipping products.  It's now the need to be perceived as ""fast"" regardless. Management has run amok  and the standard of hiring managers has plummeted. I left on my own accord just so that people don't think it's another disgruntled employee.",QA Engineer,Former Employee,"Los Gatos, CA","Jun 18, 2015"
687,3.0,"One of the best companies to work for, one of the worst company to work for","- Great Base pay.
- Some of the engineers are really smart and know what they are doing.
- Free food and well stocked kitchen.
- Good benefits including unlimited vacation.
- Stock is doing great!
-Hackday is always great and something to look for.","-Innovation is dying at this company. If you compare what the product was in 2011 vs. now, they are mostly playing with video playback in the UI and minor features. Probably the reason being, everyone wants to keep their job and want to have as many projects to continue.
- Does lot of A/B testing, even for minor text changes. I'm glad they are not in hardware business else would have ruined the company. Felt product team is good, but not sure about what is right and don't have gut feeling on any thing. 
- Engineering teams competes with each other to build tools. Sometimes the work done for 9 months is thrown because other team built tool with cutting-edge technology.
 - Freedom and responsibility is there but it all depends upon on your leader &  how much he allows to exercise it.
- NIH within team syndrome.
- Managers are sometimes pain and always want to build their 'own' team with 'own' people which discourages existing team.
- IF you are looking for growth in the team, be careful of which team you are joining. 
- Favoritism is there and if the Mgr is really bad with employees, but good with his boss, he will get promoted. 360 only matters from peers and not from whom you manage.
- Can't raise question on why we are doing this.If you are not aligned with manager's vision, sorry but you will get axed soon based on ground of technical imcompetency.
- They try lots of recommendation A/B tests and merch logic but they are not sure if people will watch the title or not.

Ultimately they need to realize they are streaming company which has value in only 1 thing : Content. If you build great product but content is not effective, you are relying on product and not content to sell. If rivals catch up on product , its an issue.",Senior Software Engineer,Former Employee,"Los Gatos, CA","Aug 11, 2017"
688,4.0,Netflix Marketing,The freedom & responsibility culture is real. It is nice to go to battle alongside fully-formed adults who are the best at what they do. The product is amazing and incredibly fun to market. Reed is an incredible leader….focused and effective.,"While one of the plus sides of the debate culture is gathering multiple perspectives on your work, the downside is that you can get slowed down by the need to accommodate a myriad of stakeholders. Marketing leadership also hasn't quite found the right balance of art and science. While Netflix has become an entertainment brand, it should be careful to not set up an organization that acts/looks/feels exactly like a Hollywood company. If you are not in L.A. and/or working on creative, it has become increasingly difficult to feel like you are truly part of the Netflix marketing organization.",Anonymous Employee,Current Employe,,"Feb 20, 2016"

It is a complete lie when their culture memo preaches that they give employees ""feedback"" with time to work on their manager's unreasonably high expectations - they do not give you any idea that you are not meeting expectations, just let you go without warning.

Then it was announced the company was splitting to two (one DVD and one Streaming) and then it was announced none of that was happening. All the while customers were up in arms over this and we in management were always finding things out at the same time customers were so we had no time to prep our staff.

Free snacks and flexible time.,"Management can and will fire you for any reason they want. Don't make the mistake thinking it can only be performance related. There are no guidelines to how long it takes to terminate you. Before you know a pink slip may be handed to you. I saw people get fired without anyone understanding why. 

Corporate culture wants people who strive to make the company better. Most are simply yes-men to keep their high salary job.

Food at a very affordable price","1. They either like you or they don’t. You HAVE to play work politics and meet as many upper level managers as possible. Your numbers, your adaption to their “culture”, and your prior work experience DO NOT matter when it comes to growth within the company. 
2. You can’t get up and use the bathroom. Your breaks and lunches can be moved around (if approved by WFM) so they tell you to move your break up so you can get up and use the bathroom. You literally have to fill out HR accommodation forms to have certain privileges such as bathroom use. 
3. You had an emergency? If you have the emergency hours to cover it, GREAT! But if you don’t, expect to be put on probation or fired the next time you walk in. They expect you to PTO 24 hours before and it’s like they wanted you to anticipate the emergency 24 hours before. 
4. Coaching is a joke. Literally the sups ask us what WE want to work on. What we thought of our own performance and place those ideas into our action plan. My question is, aren’t the sups suppose to know the problems? Aren’t they suppose to be the ones prepared for the meeting and have a course of action? It feels like I’m doing their job and they just say “great idea let me write this down and submit it!” They will ALWAYS tell you what you are doing wrong but unless upper management makes a comment about moral being down, they will never compliment you.  
5. Utah is a right to work state. In plain English it means the company doesn’t need to have a reason to fire you, hence why a lot of other big companies place their call centers here. This law allows some employers to abuse the stability of employees and base their decisions on emotions instead performance.",Customer Service Representative,Current Employee,"Salt Lake City, UT","Feb 27, 2018"

Your good judgement is only good if you follow their opinion of good judgement. Even if you have a good reason to do something differently, its not okay.

Their policy of fail well means you can make a mistake once. not twice. Terminations are frequent, and abrupt. In the last 6-8 months they have termed 3 supervisors, and about 15-18 people. There is a higher than average rate of churn here.

While they pay high wages, and provide low cost benefits this is done as a way to make everyone replaceable. It makes it easy to attract new employees.

704,4.0,"Great company, with some growing pains","When they say that Netflix chooses stunning colleagues, they are not kidding: I am constantly impressed with the smart, thoughtful people I work with on a daily basis. I love the company's focus on Inclusion & Diversity (and, I honestly notice it often, by looking around the room and seeing faces like mine in every meeting), and I am continually impressed at how the company adheres to these principles. The transparency is usually great, and it's fun to be a part of an exciting, growing company. The salary is exceptional, and the benefits are also excellent (note: hourly employees get slightly less in terms of benefits, but it's still great). 

There's a lot of freedom here to set your schedule and work around personal commitments if you need to (e.g. my kid has a doctor's appointment, I will be WFH, etc.), as well as to make decisions that benefit the company, your team, etc.  

The culture deck is intimidating when you first read it, but I have found that it's pretty right on - there are some things that I think are not adhered to quite as often as it says, but overall, it's on point.","Work life balance is a thing, but I do think a lot of it is how well you defend your boundaries - I work a couple of hours of OT a week, and I am generally ""on call"" in the sense that I will check my email after hours, but I am not expected to work at off hours - in fact, my manager specifically tells me to wait until I am back at work to complete things. I do think upper management works very long hours, and that can lead to burn-out. The flip side of this is that there is a lot of flexibility to take vacation/personal time, and people trust you if you need to take some time for doctor's appointments, stuff for your kids, WFH, etc. 

The firing culture doesn't seem to touch ICs as much as it does management. It is scary sometimes to see those messages come through, but the leaders do try to set context and make themselves available for comments, questions, concerns, etc. 

I do think the whole concept of good ideas coming from anywhere is true to some extent, but it definitely depends on the team and the leader to whom you are pitching things. You have to be smart about choosing the right time/people. 

The onboarding/training needs a lot of work. Not having a solid training for new hires was stressful and alienating. I spent the first few months wondering if I had made the right choice by coming here, but I am a year in, and feeling much more comfortable.

709,4.0,"Netflix is a great place to work for a couple of years and get on your resume, then leave for the next opportunity","- Netflix treats their employees like adults, giving them both ""freedom & responsibility"" (a favorite company catchphrase) to do their jobs.  Not hampered by lots of processes or structure, employees are empowered to find the best and most direct solutions to their problems
- Great work environment that's casual but high performance.  The emphasis is on results, and not on face time in the office.  If you need to take time off or work from home, you can, as long as your work gets done
- Full of really smart, fun people.  You get the chance to work with a lot of highly competent and impressive employees.
- Typical benefits are fine (health insurance, etc.), but the extra perks are especially nice, such as no vacation limit and a generous hardware/gadget policy
- It's nice to work for a brand that consumers love.  People tend to get excited when they hear you work at Netflix.
Overall, Netflix is one of the best work environments I've been in, except for a few major downsides ...","- There is essentially no career growth or promotions within the company.  Most positions are filled externally, and people tend to stay in the exact same job for a couple of years before they get frustrated and leave.  This is the number one employee complaint, which senior management knows about and seems to implicitly support
- Very high turnover, due to both voluntary departures and frequent terminations.  High pressure, high performance culture coupled with frequent firings often create a culture of fear
- Titles are deflated one level lower than the rest of the industry.  This is fine while at Netflix (compensation is usually appropriate for the work you do), but can be difficult once you want to leave Netflix and are looking for your next job

710,2.0,"Not high standards, high conformity","Many of the engineers are genuinely good within their bounds. They exhibit a desire to get work done. The tooling is excellent, deployments globally are a breeze, and one can gather great insights from the metrics.

Pay and benefits are amazing.","Please stop firing amazing talent. Other posts here paint the wrong picture -- that those who survive at Netflix are the best. It is inaccurate at best. The quality of many of those let go is not in doubt, but management is frequently inept at appreciating their ability. Many who stay are very bright, but many who are let go are as well.

If you do not tow engineering's backwards line you are looked down upon. People live in constant fear of being canned and this causes them to behave in an immature fashion painting their peers as less than they are. Some seem to delight in the plight of others who are let go -- a mentality of ""better him than me."" It is not survival of the fittest, it is a blind thought police, who speak openly about wanting to hear others' opinions (as long as the opinion agrees with theirs) and then balk when they are actually given. Alternatives are not actually wanted, obedience and maintaining the status quo are. If you are to be disruptive, you must be disruptive in their way.

711,3.0,"Fun ride, fast pace and changes (including your job)","- Good pay
The base pay is very attractive. While it ends up being pretty equal to other companies' total comp, it is enticing to get it up front in your base pay. No guessing on how the company will perform. But understand it is iffy as to whether you will make much more beyond your initial offer.

- Interesting challenges
They really are willing to challenge the status quo and test new ideas. Things are not always arrived at efficiently, but it is great to see innovation throughout the company and not just in tech groups.

- Growing company with solid  successes
After being at some tech companies in a downward spiral, it was refreshing to be on the upswing and enjoy the possibilities that come with performing well.","- Benefits are weirdly inconsistent
Amazing maternity leave but I had to pay quite a bit out-of-pocket for decent family health benefits, bizarre stock option plan, weak vision/dental

- The culture of fear is real in some groups
This is because it depends on your leader.  Some leaders manage up well and hide their incompetence by constantly changing their staff. I was the 3 leader of my team in a 4-year period. Also leadership does not enforce the same ""stunning colleague"" standards for non-critical orgs. 

- HR is fairly ineffective (except staffing is great)
HRBPs enable incompetent leaders because they are dependent on them. If a leader gains new teams then typically the HR person gets bigger scope as well. If the business leader doesn't ""connect"" well with their HRBP, you are likely to see the HRBP get a ""generous severance package.""

- Your job can change fast, both good and bad
Be prepared that you can gain new teams and responsibilities quickly, but you can also go from being stunning to out the door in a matter of weeks. I think people get the high standards communication really well from the culture deck, but the speed with which your personal circumstances will change can be shockingly fast.",Anonymous Employee,Former Employee,"Los Gatos, CA","Jul 7, 2017"

725,5.0,High performance culture; freedom and responsibility within,"Freedom and responsibility. You're treated like an adult. You're part of a pro team that is highly functioning. The company is well respected and has a super positive brand awareness -- i'm never able to go anywhere without getting peppered with raves and happy customer comments, and i love wearing company logo gear when i'm out for this reason.

You matter at Netflix. There is no dead wood, everyone is doing something very important to the company or they wouldn't be there. What you are doing matters and makes a difference, and that feels good. You can really make a difference no matter what your role.

The company often repeats that as an employee, you're not on an olympic team -- meaning, you don't do this 24/7 with no life, with all focus on the gold. WE're more of a varsity team, playing to win, very good, but still have to balance with classes and learning. We need to have a good work/life balance and its very important to the company that we do. 

I think the best thing - and its subtle - is this no vacation/no holiday stuff. you work when you work. they seem to realize that everyone is working hard and all the time. nights. weekends often. a ton of hard work. so if you want to take time off for a vacation, a long holiday, a day off, whatever- it happens at your own discretion. you don't ask, you don't get permission. you just do what you have to do. no one is keeping track. i've never heard of this kind of policy and you cannot imagine what it doest for your morale, for feeling like you're being treated like a grown up. For that rule alone I think it stands beyond any other org.","Netflix is not for everyone. You don't get ""direction"" so much as everyone shares a common understanding of company strategy and goals. You are free to work, and some will find this harder than just being told what to do. Netflix doesn't have ""average"" workers - everyone is high functioning, highly motivated and independent, and expectations are enormous. There is nothing like a career position here. There is high turn over, and its unnerving to many. There is an understanding: ""good average work and productivity does not get a modest raise, but a generous severence."" 

It's a pro team, and the team fit is also as important as the individual performance. You could be excellent, but if you're not HIGHLY communicative, cooperative, egoless, you can get cut just in the team balancing of moving quickly and effectively. 

you must be able and willing to share early and often about everything. projects that are new and forming get debated and you have to defend your position and hear critique well. recognizing that criticism is of the work and not you is essential -- a thin skin won't work well. quiet hard work doesn't work well (for some engineers perhaps); you don't ask permission, but you must be able to clearly articulate why you do what you are doing, and support this position. you must realize that ideas are not fragile, and only through debate with smart people who share your understanding of company goals and strategy will ideas be improved.

756,4.0,"Great company, with some growing pains","When they say that Netflix chooses stunning colleagues, they are not kidding: I am constantly impressed with the smart, thoughtful people I work with on a daily basis. I love the company's focus on Inclusion & Diversity (and, I honestly notice it often, by looking around the room and seeing faces like mine in every meeting), and I am continually impressed at how the company adheres to these principles. The transparency is usually great, and it's fun to be a part of an exciting, growing company. The salary is exceptional, and the benefits are also excellent (note: hourly employees get slightly less in terms of benefits, but it's still great). 

There's a lot of freedom here to set your schedule and work around personal commitments if you need to (e.g. my kid has a doctor's appointment, I will be WFH, etc.), as well as to make decisions that benefit the company, your team, etc.  

The culture deck is intimidating when you first read it, but I have found that it's pretty right on - there are some things that I think are not adhered to quite as often as it says, but overall, it's on point.","Work life balance is a thing, but I do think a lot of it is how well you defend your boundaries - I work a couple of hours of OT a week, and I am generally ""on call"" in the sense that I will check my email after hours, but I am not expected to work at off hours - in fact, my manager specifically tells me to wait until I am back at work to complete things. I do think upper management works very long hours, and that can lead to burn-out. The flip side of this is that there is a lot of flexibility to take vacation/personal time, and people trust you if you need to take some time for doctor's appointments, stuff for your kids, WFH, etc. 

The firing culture doesn't seem to touch ICs as much as it does management. It is scary sometimes to see those messages come through, but the leaders do try to set context and make themselves available for comments, questions, concerns, etc. 

I do think the whole concept of good ideas coming from anywhere is true to some extent, but it definitely depends on the team and the leader to whom you are pitching things. You have to be smart about choosing the right time/people. 

The onboarding/training needs a lot of work. Not having a solid training for new hires was stressful and alienating. I spent the first few months wondering if I had made the right choice by coming here, but I am a year in, and feeling much more comfortable.

The quality of many of those let go is not in doubt, but management is frequently inept at appreciating their ability. Many who stay are very bright, but many who are let go are as well.

If you do not tow engineering's backwards line you are looked down upon.

The base pay is very attractive. While it ends up being pretty equal to other companies' total comp, it is enticing to get it up front in your base pay. No guessing on how the company will perform. But understand it is iffy as to whether you will make much more beyond your initial offer.

- Interesting challenges
They really are willing to challenge the status quo and test new ideas. Things are not always arrived at efficiently, but it is great to see innovation throughout the company and not just in tech groups.

Amazing maternity leave but I had to pay quite a bit out-of-pocket for decent family health benefits, bizarre stock option plan, weak vision/dental

- The culture of fear is real in some groups
This is because it depends on your leader.  Some leaders manage up well and hide their incompetence by constantly changing their staff. I was the 3 leader of my team in a 4-year period. Also leadership does not enforce the same ""stunning colleague"" standards for non-critical orgs. 

- HR is fairly ineffective (except staffing is great)
HRBPs enable incompetent leaders because they are dependent on them. If a leader gains new teams then typically the HR person gets bigger scope as well. If the business leader doesn't ""connect"" well with their HRBP, you are likely to see the HRBP get a ""generous severance package.""

- Your job can change fast, both good and bad
Be prepared that you can gain new teams and responsibilities quickly, but you can also go from being stunning to out the door in a matter of weeks.

Everyone outside of Netflix understands and loves the service which is a pretty big perk.,"Netflix is the first place I've worked where you can get fired for doing too good of a job. Managers are always changing usually as a result of being shown the door. The constant turnover leads to another problem in that there is not much domain expertise in the systems built in Netflix because of the high turnover.

There is no career growth in Netflix. What you are hired for is more than likely what you will be doing for your stay at the company which on average is only a couple of years. There are cases where engineers / managers morph into something different but it was very rare.

Box lunches are provided but they are terrible. That food is not meant for human consumption. A variety of vendors would be nice.

The unlimited vacation policy is touted as a key benefit but watch out. Constantly changing priorities and short deadlines along with no job overlap means you are going to be able to take that nice vacation to take.

The compensation is skewed in that there are no bonuses or stock grants for the rank and file employees. Insurance for anything beyond the employee ( significant other / family ) will be passed along to the employee. In many cases I've heard this can pretty expensive.

Benefits don't really cover much,  2. HR coordinators are a freaking joke. I am on short term disability due to pregnancy complications. I was extremely active and fast about getting all the management I needed involved so there wasn't any I didn't knows down the line.  My doctor has suggested my return date to be September 1st based on my exams. I've been very diligent in updating the HR coordinator over leaves about what's going on after each appointment, to which I rarely get a response.

I have no problem with providing documentation for them. I do have an issue with when I ask a HR Coordinator if they have a fax number that I could send this to as traveling is a bit difficult for me at the moment or when I ask about the process of maternity leave I get a three sentence email basically saying I don't know and text me if you have questions.  Then when I email saying I'm unfortunately phoneless at the moment til I can get it repaired can I just email. I get no response at all! They say they care,  they don't.  They treat you like you're lying about everything.  They are extremely pushy and have no communication together.

788,2.0,"Netflix as a service is great, but I don't recommend them as an employer, at least, not at the Hillsboro call center.","Like many of the reviews have already said, Netflix does offer some nice employee benefits, especially the employee stock purchase program (take a look at what Netflix stock has been doing, the last couple of years - you'll wish you'd bought in 2007)  

I've met some great people while working there, both peers and supervisors.  

For the most part, customer support is incredibly easy, because the service itself works pretty smoothly.  When it doesn't, CS reps have the power to make things right for customers, which is fabulous.

Unlimited time off (within reason, and when it's available) is awesome.","Ultimately, the cons outweigh the pros.  I will be voluntarily leaving Netflix for a new job in the very near future.

Netflix treats employees like they're completely expendable.  I realize that no one is indispensable to a company, but Netflix uses up employees like I use up tissues when I have a cold.  The turnover is ridiculous, and it doesn't have to be that way.

For CS reps, the main statistic used to determine our ""worthiness"" is the DSAT.  Customers get asked a simple question after contacting customer service: ""Were you satisfied with the call?""  A ""no"" response counts against the rep, even if it was something the rep couldn't control (I'm sorry, it looks like your bank declined your card for this month's service fee.), or the customer was making an unreasonable demand (I got a disc that won't play!  Give me six months of free service or I'm cancelling!).  Netflix's stance is that we should be able to sugar-coat bad news so well that the customer doesn't hang up unhappy.  This method of measurement is incredibly flawed and has led to reps ""gaming"" the system to avoid ""no"" responses.  

Netflix does not give raises.  Period.  Not for cost of living, not for length of time employed, not even for outstanding performance.  I have worked there 3+ years and my stats have been stellar the whole time.  So stellar, I'm one of the people they have trainees shadow, to hear how to handle calls properly.  I have *never* gotten a raise.  Monetarily, Netflix considers my value to be the same as a new hire who just got out of training.

No paid time off.  (Unless I want to take a pay cut and bank that toward paid time off.)

Mandatory overtime during the holidays.  (They're promising it won't happen again this year, but that's what they said last year ... and we had mandatory overtime for three months last winter.  And the winter before.)

Extremely limited career options - unless you want to be a CS supervisor, you're pretty much out of luck at the call center.

Narrow-focus hiring - Netflix hires people with EXACTLY the skills they need for a particular position.  If that position goes away, so does the person.  There is very little provision for cross-training or retraining a good employee to fit them in somewhere else.

TRaSE - one exception to the cross-training policy has been TRaSE, which is a disaster, so far.  TRaSE combined the department that handles streaming tech support escalations with the department that handles loss prevention: billing fraud, shipping issues, physical inventory problems and website content issues.  They all received cross-training, and even though there's more people to handle problems now, CS reps can never get a response when they have an urgent loss prevention issue.  Reps have to tell customers ""someone will get back to you within 1-3 business days.""  What happened to ""one call resolution""?  There's a guaranteed ""no"" response for my DSAT.  Thanks a lot.

Workforce Management can't seem to forecast how much staff is needed; we will have weeks where they offer to let reps go home early every day, and then a couple of weeks later, they're offering voluntary extra hours and begging people to stay after their shifts.  This is probably related to the fact that Marketing doesn't feel like they need to let anyone know about promotions until the last minute.

Speaking of Marketing, they don't seem to feel a need to ask anyone what kind of impact various promotions will have on the rest of Netflix's operations.  The ""no credit card necessary for a free trial"" promo was a fiasco, much of which could have been avoided by asking some seasoned reps a few key questions.  

The same can be said about some of the ""tests"" that Engineering sets up on the website.  Isn't it logical to maybe ask a few questions of the people who actually talk to the customers before you try something out?  I realize that we need to find out what works and what doesn't, but if a ""test"" makes the service unusable or unpalatable for a customer and they call to complain, CS reps can't remove them from the ""test"".  Netflix is willing to lose the customer because that's a valid ""test result"".  There has to be a better way.

The Canadian service was launched prematurely, in my opinion.  Many of the calls we get from Canadian customers center on the lack of content, especially newer releases.  The Canadian streaming library will grow, just like the US library, but that's not a satisfying answer to Canadian customers.

790,2.0,"Little culture, mostly just cult.","Good entertainment content and service to consumers.

The good news; it’s easy to get a CSR job.  They claim to hire only “top performers”, but you don’t even need to have call center experience to get hired.  Also, no background check or drug screening.  So if you’re into your substances, you won’t be alone.  There are no performance criteria or reviews.  Sounds good.  However, makes it hard to know where you stand with them.  Everyone is in fear of losing their jobs.  

The pay is good.  They have to pay higher to keep up with their employee turnover problem.  Benefits are OK.  Paid parental leave is great.  You only have to be employed for a short time and are eligible for months of paid leave, when you or your spouse has a baby.  Work a month, get paid for four—a pretty good deal.  They make a big deal out of the free coffee, green bananas and trail mix.  They supply free toilet paper, too.","Don’t let the name on the building fool you.  The SLC call center is not like the Netflix you see on TV or in the media.  It’s just a call center with a fancy name.  When looking at reviews, you will want to distinguish between the corporate side of the business (Streaming, Production, Los Gatos, L.A.) and the SLC customer service facility.  The customer service division is the stepchild of Netflix.  The pay is different, benefits different, policies different, culture different and management way-different.  

You hear a lot about Netflix culture, values and diversity.  Don’t mistake corporate’s PR for what’s going on in SLC.  SLC has their own set of rules.  All of the decision-makers are young, macho, wanna-be hipster, white men.  They are very good at playing the game.  Do it their way or get out. If you can get along with them, you may have a chance to hang around a while and put the fancy name on your resume.  If you’re not one of them, there’s not much advancement opportunity.

Everyone outside of Netflix understands and loves the service which is a pretty big perk.,"Netflix is the first place I've worked where you can get fired for doing too good of a job. Managers are always changing usually as a result of being shown the door. The constant turnover leads to another problem in that there is not much domain expertise in the systems built in Netflix because of the high turnover.

There is no career growth in Netflix. What you are hired for is more than likely what you will be doing for your stay at the company which on average is only a couple of years. There are cases where engineers / managers morph into something different but it was very rare.

Box lunches are provided but they are terrible. That food is not meant for human consumption. A variety of vendors would be nice.

The unlimited vacation policy is touted as a key benefit but watch out. Constantly changing priorities and short deadlines along with no job overlap means you are going to be able to take that nice vacation to take.

The compensation is skewed in that there are no bonuses or stock grants for the rank and file employees. Insurance for anything beyond the employee ( significant other / family ) will be passed along to the employee. In many cases I've heard this can pretty expensive.

845,2.0,"Netflix as a service is great, but I don't recommend them as an employer, at least, not at the Hillsboro call center.","Like many of the reviews have already said, Netflix does offer some nice employee benefits, especially the employee stock purchase program (take a look at what Netflix stock has been doing, the last couple of years - you'll wish you'd bought in 2007)  

I've met some great people while working there, both peers and supervisors.  

For the most part, customer support is incredibly easy, because the service itself works pretty smoothly.  When it doesn't, CS reps have the power to make things right for customers, which is fabulous.

Unlimited time off (within reason, and when it's available) is awesome.","Ultimately, the cons outweigh the pros.  I will be voluntarily leaving Netflix for a new job in the very near future.

Netflix treats employees like they're completely expendable.  I realize that no one is indispensable to a company, but Netflix uses up employees like I use up tissues when I have a cold.  The turnover is ridiculous, and it doesn't have to be that way.

For CS reps, the main statistic used to determine our ""worthiness"" is the DSAT.  Customers get asked a simple question after contacting customer service: ""Were you satisfied with the call?""  A ""no"" response counts against the rep, even if it was something the rep couldn't control (I'm sorry, it looks like your bank declined your card for this month's service fee.), or the customer was making an unreasonable demand (I got a disc that won't play!  Give me six months of free service or I'm cancelling!).  Netflix's stance is that we should be able to sugar-coat bad news so well that the customer doesn't hang up unhappy.  This method of measurement is incredibly flawed and has led to reps ""gaming"" the system to avoid ""no"" responses.  

Netflix does not give raises.  Period.  Not for cost of living, not for length of time employed, not even for outstanding performance.  I have worked there 3+ years and my stats have been stellar the whole time.  So stellar, I'm one of the people they have trainees shadow, to hear how to handle calls properly.  I have *never* gotten a raise.  Monetarily, Netflix considers my value to be the same as a new hire who just got out of training.

No paid time off.  (Unless I want to take a pay cut and bank that toward paid time off.)

Mandatory overtime during the holidays.  (They're promising it won't happen again this year, but that's what they said last year ... and we had mandatory overtime for three months last winter.  And the winter before.)

Extremely limited career options - unless you want to be a CS supervisor, you're pretty much out of luck at the call center.

Narrow-focus hiring - Netflix hires people with EXACTLY the skills they need for a particular position.  If that position goes away, so does the person.  There is very little provision for cross-training or retraining a good employee to fit them in somewhere else.

TRaSE - one exception to the cross-training policy has been TRaSE, which is a disaster, so far.  TRaSE combined the department that handles streaming tech support escalations with the department that handles loss prevention: billing fraud, shipping issues, physical inventory problems and website content issues.  They all received cross-training, and even though there's more people to handle problems now, CS reps can never get a response when they have an urgent loss prevention issue.  Reps have to tell customers ""someone will get back to you within 1-3 business days.""  What happened to ""one call resolution""?  There's a guaranteed ""no"" response for my DSAT.  Thanks a lot.

Workforce Management can't seem to forecast how much staff is needed; we will have weeks where they offer to let reps go home early every day, and then a couple of weeks later, they're offering voluntary extra hours and begging people to stay after their shifts.  This is probably related to the fact that Marketing doesn't feel like they need to let anyone know about promotions until the last minute.

Speaking of Marketing, they don't seem to feel a need to ask anyone what kind of impact various promotions will have on the rest of Netflix's operations.  The ""no credit card necessary for a free trial"" promo was a fiasco, much of which could have been avoided by asking some seasoned reps a few key questions.  

The same can be said about some of the ""tests"" that Engineering sets up on the website.  Isn't it logical to maybe ask a few questions of the people who actually talk to the customers before you try something out?  I realize that we need to find out what works and what doesn't, but if a ""test"" makes the service unusable or unpalatable for a customer and they call to complain, CS reps can't remove them from the ""test"".  Netflix is willing to lose the customer because that's a valid ""test result"".  There has to be a better way.

The Canadian service was launched prematurely, in my opinion.  Many of the calls we get from Canadian customers center on the lack of content, especially newer releases.  The Canadian streaming library will grow, just like the US library, but that's not a satisfying answer to Canadian customers.

The good news; it’s easy to get a CSR job.  They claim to hire only “top performers”, but you don’t even need to have call center experience to get hired.  Also, no background check or drug screening.  So if you’re into your substances, you won’t be alone.  There are no performance criteria or reviews.  Sounds good.  However, makes it hard to know where you stand with them.  Everyone is in fear of losing their jobs.  

The pay is good.  They have to pay higher to keep up with their employee turnover problem.  Benefits are OK.  Paid parental leave is great.  You only have to be employed for a short time and are eligible for months of paid leave, when you or your spouse has a baby.  Work a month, get paid for four—a pretty good deal.

The SLC call center is not like the Netflix you see on TV or in the media.  It’s just a call center with a fancy name.  When looking at reviews, you will want to distinguish between the corporate side of the business (Streaming, Production, Los Gatos, L.A.) and the SLC customer service facility.  The customer service division is the stepchild of Netflix.  The pay is different, benefits different, policies different, culture different and management way-different.  

You hear a lot about Netflix culture, values and diversity.  Don’t mistake corporate’s PR for what’s going on in SLC.  SLC has their own set of rules.  All of the decision-makers are young, macho, wanna-be hipster, white men.  They are very good at playing the game.  Do it their way or get out.

856,2.0,Netflix is Great!  ...Just Stay Out of the Call Center.,"The upper management of Netflix really does seem to want to take a different approach with how they handle their employees, and accepts the fact that as an adult, you're able to get your job done. They appear to be very with it.  The call center attempts to echo that sentiment, and provides many perks that make work an alright place to be.  From the free coffee and refreshments in the cafeteria to the free rental plan, great benefits, and competitive pay, there is a great ideal that the company attempts to live up to - that the people populating the center are worth the extra buck or two.  It was refreshing to work for a company that was capable of identifying problems, and instead of sweeping them under the rug, took the initiative to change the problem.","Specific to the Hillsboro location, the middle-management is hit-or-miss with whether or not they treat you like a valued member of the team.  Many of the team managers do not communicate clearly with their teams - as a member of the support staff, it was evident which managers were taking the time to coach, train, and encourage their teammates, and which were not.  Many reps who were extremely good at their job were let go for seemingly innocuous reasons, veiling the manager's personal dislike for the individual.  The Hillsboro center has been open since September of 2006, and very few (if any) original cast members from the first three training classes exist.  The management of the call center was not in any way stable; the entire team had been replaced once over, and in the less-than two years, they've gone through two site directors.  With all of the management, quality, and training staff adjustments, many representatives felt as though getting promoted was a death knell to your time at Netflix.  NOT that there were copious opportunities for advancement - quite the contrary.  Team managers were hired from outside of the company, and rarely were promotions from within occurring.  There were a handful of people who did move up the ladder, and, as previously mentioned, found themselves restructured out of the company, told that there was no longer work for them to do and laid off, or outright fired because they ""don't fit the way the department is going.""",Support Staff,Former Employe,"Hillsboro, OR","Aug 7, 2008"

They'll fall in!) is their only retention policy after that.

858,1.0,Don't make the mistake of working here,"1.  Pay is good, and for some tough to fill roles, pay is very good.  
2.  The stock option plan is a good deal.
3.  A number of policies treat people like adults (dress code, attendance, and vacation/holidays).  You can take as much time off as you want, as long as you get your job done.
4.  A number of smart people get hired.
5.  The industry is growing very fast.  
6.  Well known brand with instant street recognition.  
7.  Facilities are pretty good.","1.  Look at the comments on this site around turnover, treating people poorly, sick culture, and weak senior leadership.  These are all very accurate.
2.  No training, management training, or development.  The philosophy is if you don’t have what we need, we will replace you (i.e., fire you for not being a “good fit”) with someone from the outside who has that.  
3.  Hourly jobs in particular have stagnant pay.  
4.  There are no bonuses or incentives.
5.  The culture has serious problems.  
  a.  You will see countless references on this site to a “culture of fear”.  This is widespread in every department and division.  Even executives laugh that their time is numbered.  A company that functions on fear is not a place for the long term.  When everyone in a room is asked do they fear being fired and everyone says yes, that is a big problem.
  b.  A culture of watching your back and stabbing others in the back.  Many employees, including C level people, participate and have learned that tossing others under the bus, keeps them safe.   They see this as a way to protect themselves from scrutiny from above.  Employees and managers are all too comfortable talking about what is not working with a person.   The 360 review process reinforces this.  Those who have been there the longest are almost soulless with regard to firings.  They have fired or seen so many people let go that they don’t really care anymore.   
6.  You can be fired without warning, feedback, or any coaching.   Most employees don’t bring any personal belongings to work as they could be let go at any moment.  It is often a surprise.
7.  Do not move for a job with Netflix.  If your partner or spouse doesn’t work, you could be risking your families financial health.  There is no job security regardless of how good you are.  Performance does not equal security at Netflix.  
8.  Managers have a 1 year shelf life before they get shown the door.  Directors and VPs are constantly evaluating managers, so anytime you make a mistake, are perceived not to be cutting edge, it could be your turn.
9.  HR’s job is to hire and show people the door.  HR brags about how good they are at firing people.  They don’t help employees, nor are they there to help employees become better.   Their role is simply to ensure the company doesn’t get sued and headhunt for all the people that are turning over.  
10. Managers main role is making their team better through constrantly looking for their weaker employees.  Leaders are asked could they hire someone better.  Of course the answer will always be yes.
11.  No severance package is enough to compensate you for disruption in your career, moving, or the stress that comes without having a job.  
12.  The recruiting function will hire you fast.  The idea is to keep you excited, but if you are reading this don’t get caught up in the Netflix product of movies—look at whether this is actually a place you want to work.
13.  It’s incredibly stressful and life-shortening for you and your loved ones.  Why work at a place where people, including your hiring managers, treat you as completely disposable?",Manager,Former Employe,"Los Gatos, CA","Feb 11, 2011"

-Excellent fun and Training","-3rd Party Call center expectations-with Telus International as the client. (Telus is not as ""laid back"" as Netflix proclaims to be so there is a bit of a disconnect there).

-Changes made quickly after start so some training tools were useless such as:
-Have to keep up with 3 different metrics--which is fine except for the Average Handle Time is 5.5 min--which in training was not an issue. This metric supports customers who know what they're doing such as: how to use a PC, know what kind of PC they have, IF it is in fact a PC, aware of any info on their devices.  In other words a lot of elder cust may feel frustrated that agent is more worried about handle time instead of providing best cust service experience. Double Digits are not your friend. So trying to troubleshoot a technical issue with someone who is not very tech savvy in under 9 minutes or calming an irate cust because the system charged them even though they deserved a free trial or the NUMEROUS calls for payment authorizations which cause a lot of cust to have to keep double the amount of their service cost on their card at all times

-Technical training is not a requirement but you'll notice most of Team Leads or CSR2's are very techy--which makes for satisfied cust because they may be able to explain why their internet may not be working properly in a confident knowing manner. Overeducating is a no-no but you will find them doing this. 

-You are basically encouraged to hurry the cust through the phone call and if they cannot speak English (no spanish support) you are encouraged to have them get an interpreter--also if they are not computer savvy (like some elderly people) you are encouraged to have them try back later when they can get someone to help them. Its basically refer refer refer refer when you can. Not really customer service based or rather not really customer-based. 

-Telus very strict scheduling environment. Make sure your attendance and adherence are on point
-Recording phone calls and allowing you to listen to all your mistakes or rather having a supervisor point out things you did wrong (not much Pos feedback) and write you up for it is supposed to be a method of ""coaching"" but feels more like Big Brother. The threat of being let go is constantly hovering over your head. 
-The position itself seems highly energetic but is unstable--no career focus there
-Turnover is atrocious. which leads to back-to-back calls with no breaks between. Being late or absent on weekends is double the penalty. And the schedule can change without notice.",Customer Service Representative,Current Employee,"Las Vegas, NV","Oct 2, 2012"

Netflix is filled with mature adults that are not politically motivated.  Netflix management does a pretty good job of setting the proper context for employees and letting them run independently.  Employees enjoy a culture of freedom and responsibility that few other companies offer.  As an example, we have no vacation policy, you take what you need.

No advancement outside of the call center, and the advancement within the call center is pretty competative.

They pay a pretty high cash salary. You get to claim that you're in the movie business.","Netflix makes a big deal about their hiring policies. They claim that they regularly evaluate employee performance, and let the lowest performers go. To me, this sounded great! In contrast to many other companies where lazy and incompetent people hang around for years, Netflix tried to retain only the best and brightest people.

Unfortunately, that's not what it was like in reality. A week after I started at Netflix, the recruiter who hired me was unceremoniously dismissed. Then the tech support guy in our office was released. Then an engineer on my team. In each of these cases, it wasn't clear what these folks had done wrong. They had all been technically competent, friendly and hard working. This promoted a culture of fear where no one felt that their job was secure.

It turns out that there were several things going on. Managers were given incentives to regularly purge employees. So, managers developed antagonistic relationships with employees. In most normal companies, a key responsibility of a manager is to defend their team in front of senior management. At Netflix, this just doesn't happen.

Additionally, Netflix doesn't have adequate mechanisms for providing feedback and review to employees. (In the year I spent at Netflix, I didn't receive a single review, positive or negative.) Without a formal system for employee evaluation, managers resort to picking favorites: they hire in their friends, and fire people who they aren't friends with. I saw this happen to many different people while I was at Netflix. It's allowable by law (everyone is an ""at will"" employee), but it does not lead Netflix to hire and retain the best people.

Netflix has had the good fortune to be in an easy business. They moved early into online DVD rentals, and have large cost advantages over potential rivals. Their competitors (Blockbuster, Walmart, etc) took major missteps, and were not really able to compete. Netflix doesn't have to be the best at anything they do: operations, marketing, movie recommendations, etc. They just have to be OK at these things to run a profitable business, and they are only OK at them.",Senior Software Engineer,Former Employe,"Los Gatos, CA","Apr 16, 2009"

I've found the answer to that question to be ""absolutely"". 

If you are not a really smart, driven person who can operate completely independently and with little direction from management, then you will not be happy or successful at Netflix.

No-vacation policy (As far as I am concerned, it is a scam).  They work you so hard you feel guilty about taking time off.  Between the blackberry they ""give"" you as soon as you walk through the door, and the laptop you will receive, you are never off the clock.

956,1.0,The Truth About the Netflix Call Center..... :(,"-decent starting wage (assuming you make it out of training)
-inexpensive benefits and decent health care coverage
-for the most part, employees (CSR1) are really cool to work with
-sheltered smoking area
-Free Lunch (Mac and Cheese, Oatmeal, or Ramen)
-Unlimited coffee (caution... don't take a bathroom break!!  You may get fired)
-Schedule choices offered after training (Choose Wisely)
-fairly decent training support for the first two weeks of employment (if you made it)","-Out of every 100 customers who you interact with by phone, you may only have 5-6 upset customers or you risk losing your job
-you are always tied to your desk by a phone cord
-The calls keep coming whether you want them to or not...
-There is no set concrete guidelines for evaluating personal performance.  It is all subject to caller reviews (i.e.  You're job may depend on somebody's bad day!!)
-After your initial training (assuming you made it) there is a real lack of support for training from the management team.  You will only see your team manager during your last week of training and then your first reprimand and your last day.  (Watch out for the RED PACKET!!!)
-Netflix is great at finding talented people to do the job, but they are HORRIBLE at retention.  Do they have a quota for firing people???  
-Whether you are a CSR, CSRII, Supervisor, Team Manager, or the Call Center Manager, you are never secure in this position.  Do not count on it for long term stability/security in employment.  

DISCLAIMER:  I was not fired from my job... I quit, gave notice (albeit through the attendance line)..  In all honesty, Netflix was a great transitional job for me.  I needed quick money, and work and Netflix filled that vacancy.  I was very happy with the people I worked with, as I made some really good friends while working there, and that is the only positive thing that came out of Netflix.  I now shop the Redbox.",Customer Service Representative,Former Employe,"Hillsboro, OR","Jun 2, 2010"
957,1.0,Experience totally based on supervisor. They have too much power,"Good work, good pay. Energetic environment. New technologies.","Experience in Netflix totally depends on the supervisor. If you are lucky and get a matured manager, there is no reason to not like working in NETFLIX.  However it could be a nightmare if your manager does not like you for some reason. It is always your words vs manager's word in there (happened in my case and they believe the manager). I was hired under a manager who convinced me to join Netflix (I had 24 emails from that person persuading me). However I learned after joining that I am supposed to report to a new manager and the very first day that new guy complained that I have never worked with JAVA and AWS (Then why did he agree to take me in his team in the first place ? ). Nightmare started from that very day.  He kept on mentioning the same thing every one on one. He forced me to move my position in every meeting and make sure I seat where he points me to. He will talk to all my co-workers and inform them if he is cancelling one on ones, for me he wont do anything and just disappear. He 
will constantly irritate me saying how good he was when he joined. He will always shout at me and try to ignore my opinions on any damn technical stuff. I was totally terrified of him and knew that he will make sure that I fail. He tried all he could.   He gave me two projects and one project scope kept changing and changing. Still i tried to keep up and developed good relationships with other team managers, members and project managers.One day (I am sure my manager was waiting for that day) I wrote something incorrect in an email (this is my 4th month I guess). He pounded on me, and also after a 14 hour continuous on call, I took a 2 min break, he shouted at me for 15 minutes for missing a false alram ! I apologized. He tried to blame me for what I did not do and said he and someone else was watching me silently, while I was chatting with someone else about some technical issue over a group chat. So unethical !  He said some PM complained about me and when I asked for the names and examples he refused. I raised the alarm to higher management and they said it is ""his word vs mine"". One day they said they are sorry I had to go through this and next day they change the tone and said they have to believe my manager. I requested them to talk to engineers and get feedback. They refused to even do that.  I resigned the next week as I could not take the humiliation and realized that if I stay back and work in the same group, they will find some excuse to fire me. I knew all companies where I worked before were waiting to take me back any day. So I had no worry.  The funny part is the people who were working with me kept on sending me emails about how good it was to work with me and they were surprised that I left. But my manager never found anything good in me. 

I wish I had a better manager in NETFLIX, then I would enjoy my life there so much. Please make sure you understand your supervisor before you join. That is the most important thing. Everything else will fall into place.",,Former Employe,,"Jan 11, 2017"

-Good Pay
-Excellent fun and Training","-3rd Party Call center expectations-with Telus International as the client. (Telus is not as ""laid back"" as Netflix proclaims to be so there is a bit of a disconnect there).

-Changes made quickly after start so some training tools were useless such as:
-Have to keep up with 3 different metrics--which is fine except for the Average Handle Time is 5.5 min--which in training was not an issue. This metric supports customers who know what they're doing such as: how to use a PC, know what kind of PC they have, IF it is in fact a PC, aware of any info on their devices.  In other words a lot of elder cust may feel frustrated that agent is more worried about handle time instead of providing best cust service experience. Double Digits are not your friend. So trying to troubleshoot a technical issue with someone who is not very tech savvy in under 9 minutes or calming an irate cust because the system charged them even though they deserved a free trial or the NUMEROUS calls for payment authorizations which cause a lot of cust to have to keep double the amount of their service cost on their card at all times

-Technical training is not a requirement but you'll notice most of Team Leads or CSR2's are very techy--which makes for satisfied cust because they may be able to explain why their internet may not be working properly in a confident knowing manner. Overeducating is a no-no but you will find them doing this. 

-You are basically encouraged to hurry the cust through the phone call and if they cannot speak English (no spanish support) you are encouraged to have them get an interpreter--also if they are not computer savvy (like some elderly people) you are encouraged to have them try back later when they can get someone to help them. Its basically refer refer refer refer when you can. Not really customer service based or rather not really customer-based. 

-Telus very strict scheduling environment. Make sure your attendance and adherence are on point
-Recording phone calls and allowing you to listen to all your mistakes or rather having a supervisor point out things you did wrong (not much Pos feedback) and write you up for it is supposed to be a method of ""coaching"" but feels more like Big Brother. The threat of being let go is constantly hovering over your head. 
-The position itself seems highly energetic but is unstable--no career focus there
-Turnover is atrocious. which leads to back-to-back calls with no breaks between. Being late or absent on weekends is double the penalty. And the schedule can change without notice.",Customer Service Representative,Current Employee,"Las Vegas, NV","Oct 2, 2012"

1010,1.0,"Like a good drama: A flashy young company in a nice setting, but with lots of tension under the surface","Netflix has nice, fancy offices in Los Gatos. They have good snacks. They pay a pretty high cash salary. You get to claim that you're in the movie business.","Netflix makes a big deal about their hiring policies. They claim that they regularly evaluate employee performance, and let the lowest performers go. To me, this sounded great! In contrast to many other companies where lazy and incompetent people hang around for years, Netflix tried to retain only the best and brightest people.

Unfortunately, that's not what it was like in reality. A week after I started at Netflix, the recruiter who hired me was unceremoniously dismissed. Then the tech support guy in our office was released. Then an engineer on my team. In each of these cases, it wasn't clear what these folks had done wrong. They had all been technically competent, friendly and hard working. This promoted a culture of fear where no one felt that their job was secure.

It turns out that there were several things going on. Managers were given incentives to regularly purge employees. So, managers developed antagonistic relationships with employees. In most normal companies, a key responsibility of a manager is to defend their team in front of senior management. At Netflix, this just doesn't happen.

Additionally, Netflix doesn't have adequate mechanisms for providing feedback and review to employees. (In the year I spent at Netflix, I didn't receive a single review, positive or negative.) Without a formal system for employee evaluation, managers resort to picking favorites: they hire in their friends, and fire people who they aren't friends with. I saw this happen to many different people while I was at Netflix. It's allowable by law (everyone is an ""at will"" employee), but it does not lead Netflix to hire and retain the best people.

Netflix has had the good fortune to be in an easy business. They moved early into online DVD rentals, and have large cost advantages over potential rivals. Their competitors (Blockbuster, Walmart, etc) took major missteps, and were not really able to compete. Netflix doesn't have to be the best at anything they do: operations, marketing, movie recommendations, etc. They just have to be OK at these things to run a profitable business, and they are only OK at them.",Senior Software Engineer,Former Employe,"Los Gatos, CA","Apr 16, 2009"

If you are lucky and get a matured manager, there is no reason to not like working in NETFLIX.  However it could be a nightmare if your manager does not like you for some reason. It is always your words vs manager's word in there (happened in my case and they believe the manager). I was hired under a manager who convinced me to join Netflix (I had 24 emails from that person persuading me). However I learned after joining that I am supposed to report to a new manager and the very first day that new guy complained that I have never worked with JAVA and AWS (Then why did he agree to take me in his team in the first place ? ). Nightmare started from that very day.  He kept on mentioning the same thing every one on one. He forced me to move my position in every meeting and make sure I seat where he points me to. He will talk to all my co-workers and inform them if he is cancelling one on ones, for me he wont do anything and just disappear. He 
will constantly irritate me saying how good he was when he joined. He will always shout at me and try to ignore my opinions on any damn technical stuff. I was totally terrified of him and knew that he will make sure that I fail. He tried all he could.   He gave me two projects and one project scope kept changing and changing. Still i tried to keep up and developed good relationships with other team managers, members and project managers.One day (I am sure my manager was waiting for that day) I wrote something incorrect in an email (this is my 4th month I guess). He pounded on me, and also after a 14 hour continuous on call, I took a 2 min break, he shouted at me for 15 minutes for missing a false alram ! I apologized. He tried to blame me for what I did not do and said he and someone else was watching me silently, while I was chatting with someone else about some technical issue over a group chat. So unethical !  He said some PM complained about me and when I asked for the names and examples he refused. I raised the alarm to higher management and they said it is ""his word vs mine"". One day they said they are sorry I had to go through this and next day they change the tone and said they have to believe my manager. I requested them to talk to engineers and get feedback. They refused to even do that.  I resigned the next week as I could not take the humiliation and realized that if I stay back and work in the same group, they will find some excuse to fire me. I knew all companies where I worked before were waiting to take me back any day. So I had no worry.  The funny part is the people who were working with me kept on sending me emails about how good it was to work with me and they were surprised that I left. But my manager never found anything good in me. 

I wish I had a better manager in NETFLIX, then I would enjoy my life there so much. Please make sure you understand your supervisor before you join. That is the most important thing. Everything else will fall into place.",,Former Employe,,"Jan 11, 2017"

Free Netflix Subscription","The people working here are so ridiculous and the trainer is straight from Sesame Street.

I knew one of the first 6 people to open the center, and she had been laid off over a year prior to when I started. She had some horror stories, but I thought the pay would overshadow any hint of doubt I had.

I made them aware of the fact that I was in school [college, obviously] prior to being invited to the interview, and they said that was fine & they'd work with me (I found out later that this is a complete lie). I went through training and everything with positive feedback. Only after that did it become an issue, and I was constantly pulled aside and berated. I am not going to quit school to slave away at a job that will last less than a year. They pulled me into random rooms around the call center and told me my ""internet browsing privileges were being taken away during my breaks,"" because I looked up Netflix reviews. I was told that my face looked ""sad and depressed."" Well, of course it was after you pulled me into a room 3 times in one day trying to make me feel bad about going to school.

They expect you to talk to 85-year-olds with Alzheimers that can't even remember their email address, let alone their name, and help them fix whatever issue they have in less than 5 minutes.

Why is there free food? Why are there showers here? Why are there laptops for you to use? Because they want you to eat, sleep and breathe Netflix.",Customer Service Representative,Former Employe,"Hillsboro, OR","Jun 22, 2011"

Supposedly you can choose from set shifts, but the time you pick is randomly assigned, meaning if you're randomly assigned to pick last, then there are no good options left. Could also mean that you work there for 2.5 years like my coworker and never get to have a weekend day off. 
In training they told us over and over again that top performers were promoted within 3 to 6 months but there have literally been no opportunities. They said numbers didn't matter, they promised unlimited time off, and a whole host of other perks. That has all been blatantly false, the entire job is a numbers game, you sit glued to your desk waiting for a coaching or meeting to break up the nightmare of the day but those keep getting pushed off to the future, which never happens. Unlimited time off was taken away, and you could be fired for a whole host of silly reasons, I myself have seen multiple coworkers walked off the floor for minor infractions, and the new policy of only 3 tardies (which could be 1 minute late) per YEAR is punitive.

1567,3.0,Amazing...and you will drown in work.,"- Amazing colleagues - hard working, smart, supportive
- Strong brand and fantastic content creators, Netflix truly lives and breathes entertainment
- Constantly striving to improve the way we work, extremely agile work environment
- Generous - high monthly salary, good bonuses (option program) and pension, maternity/paternity support, 'unlimited' days off, free food/drink at the office and much more","- Extremely competitive environment due to everyone being an overachiever. Work is never ending - 24/7 - on weekends, public holidays, during your vacation. I received emails from my manager on New Years eve with an expectation for me to respond.
- Unlimited days off sound great, but when you go on vacation you need to be ready to work. Every. Single. Day. Nobody will take over your work or help offload when you are gone, it's up to you to make your work happen. Since I started 2 years ago I have checked my email every, single day. Including on my sisters wedding. 
- At any moment you can be given a new position at the office, that you might not want or need, but it's part of the constant change that is Netflix. If you don't accept it, your services are on longer needed.
-...or even worse, you will be laid off. I've seen amazing people being let go because their manager didn't feel they were 'engaged enough' - as in, they wanted a life, disagreed one too many times or the reasoning was even more vague.
- It feels like most that work here just go with the flow. If they keep their job one more month, great, if not...well they made some money and it looks good on their CV. 
- Generally you don't have any work stability and you need to be ready for that i.e. never knowing whether you will have a job in 3 months or not. 
- Maternity/paternity leave for a year never happens - if you get 2-4 months without having to worry about your job then that's fantastic. 
- If you have a family, and children, have a good long think about what matters in life before accepting the offer. I am 'lucky' to not to have kids, just a very supportive partner, and I still feel like the worst person ever at least 1-2 days per week (as I just always cancel outings with my partner and/or friends because of work).

1659,4.0,"Some good, some bad","The people all tend to be very bright, talented and hard working. There is almost no deadwood. 

Historically, everyone made decisions based on the good of the company as a whole instead of what is good for their own teams. The atmosphere was one of mutual respect. Everyone knew everyone. As the company grows it feels like that closeness, respect and shared purpose is getting lost. 

Still, it is a good place to work in many ways. The folks at the top are the best I've ever worked for. In the engineering departments, everyone in management all the way up to the CEO is very technical. You can explain anything to any of them without their eyes glazing over.  

The fast pace means that you never get bored. There is always some new, interesting challenge.

In the nice to have category, they have free lunches. Many people complain about them, but I always thought they were pretty good. They'll all provided by the same vendor though, so it's easy to get tired of them. The buildings are nice enough. It is easy to get whatever hardware, software, or gadget you think you need. Top-end Mac or Thinkpad with a giant display? An extra desktop or two? Whatever, just put in a ticket and you'll have it in a couple of days or sooner. Need some nice servers for your project? A couple hundred cloud instances? It's all available with minimal fuss.","When it comes to people, Netflix is a throw away culture. Most people last somewhere around two years before they leave or quit. There seems to be no barriers to stop a manager from firing anyone that works for them. If your manager likes you, everything is peachy but if s/he doesn't like you for any reason at all, you're quickly out the door. 

A lot of time gets wasted by new people trying to figure out how a thing works, or (more often) just ripping it out and creating something new since whoever built it is long gone. Then these new people move on to the next company and the cycle starts again. 


The ""high performance culture"" in practice means that there are very few useless people. The downside is that you always know that your job is temporary and you're always worried that you'll be fired. It's a stressful way to live.


Netflix prides itself on being a ""nimble"" company. It will occasionally do amazing things in a very short time period. Deadlines can be crazy and they often don't take into account other work that needs to be done. Projects don't replace the workload you already have, they just add to it. Many times you'll deliver on a deadline only to find out that the work was unnecessary as someone decided to completely change the architecture or cancel the project completely. 


Everyone is assumed to be available 24x7x365. Email is sent and replied to at all hours of all days and nights. You can never let go of work.


Lastly, the company philosophy is to pay employees and let them decide what to do with the money, so there aren't a ton of perqs for working there. Benefits are okay but not great. No real gym membership, onsite masseuses or anything fancy.  The whole company used to go to Sundance every year (payed for by Netflix) but they stopped that some years ago.",,Former Employe,,"Apr 16, 2011"

1661,2.0,Be prepared for abusive directors and young untrained individuals.,"Salary, benefits, stock options, ownership.","Netflix as a company constantly says it is a strong advocate for diversity and inclusion, and do not tolerate “brilliant jerks”, or bullies. Unfortunately this is something that they talk about very often but when situations arises, they would often side with the individual of higher rank. 

In my 2 years at Netflix, I’ve noticed that you don’t have to be the brightest and smartest person in the room to excel in this company, you just have to be the loudest, and made your presence known in meetings especially the high visibility ones. 

Directors are often bullies and brilliant jerks, somethings sans brilliant - they are great at politicking and making themselves sound and look good. 

The director I am working for for example, often makes me solve director level problems. When guidance is needed the answer we get very often is “not my problem”. However if the problem was successfully solved, they would be quick to claim the credit for it as the inspiration that lead the team to the breakthrough. 

Netflix encourages weekly 1:1s with your cross functional partners and direct managers/directors, and encourages free sharing of ideas and respectful feedback during these sessions. My director however for example would use these sessions to threaten the staff, if too many questions were asked, they would be threatened with termination. 

Another issue is Netflix loves hiring very young professionals either fresh out of school or individuals on the second job. Hiring of dynamic individuals is great, however it is essential to provide young individuals with the necessary coaching to set them up for success especially when working in a high performance environment where once needs to excel and be able to separate professional and personal feelings. No coaching is provided for these young professionally immature individuals, on top of that they pay them a lot of money that probably warrants more than 10 years of experience. What happens is that these young individuals develop an inflated ego, play politics, gossip, and take everything too personally. The lack of coaching and allowing them to run amok, results in a very apparent bullying millennial mean girls/boys culture. 

HR is very aware of these problems but employees are often told that they are working on it, but nothing ever gets done. In fact, employees have stopped going to HR for any work issues, because more than often HR would side with the upper management, brand the victimized employee a “trouble employee” and eventually they will be let go. And the reason given to the entire office for their dismissal is that they are no longer excelling in their work, which most of the time is completely false. It’s almost always politics and power play involved.

I have witness this happen to many times to so many of my brilliant, hardworking and true stunning colleagues. A few of these unfortunate colleagues were also told by HR upon being let go that even though they are aware of what is happening, their hands are tied and they should just treat it as they are collateral damage. 

How much you get paid also depends on who you know, and how much you know how to “charm” your bosses and the leadership team. I know of managers who are getting paid 3 x more than directors, because they are great with charming their bosses. How they determine how much each person gets paid, does not depend on experience, skill. It depends on friendships, and how well you sell yourself. 

The money and benefits are great, but they also come at a very high cost. If you feel you are able to tolerate such an abusive environment, then this is the company for you.",Anonymous Employee,Former Employee,,"Sep 20, 2019"

Far from having daily catered lunches like the exempt staff does, there is an extreme emphasis put on eliminating ""extras"" and continually cutting costs in the hourly employee world. Some is reasonable but some is just going beyond what's necessary and seems like the cuts are made more to devalue the employees than to save the company money.
