1,"It might be easy to roll your eyes when people from Facebook say how open their culture is, but it's true; it's more open than any other place I've worked at. At a company wide-level, secret projects, public incidents, important non-public business metrics and the like are all openly discussed. You can ask questions about them directly to Zuckerburg at the weekly Q&A. I think the idea is that if everyone is on the same page or at least, differing views are heard, the company will be stronger, and solutions may be offered from a place you didn't expect. This is much different from previous companies I worked at, where discussions on internal email lists would be shut down by some lawyer saying that there's certain things that can't be discussed, and important data is divided up to groups and individuals on a ""need to know"" basis, etc. 

This culture applies at a lower level too. You feel comfortable giving feedback to each other about each other, about product decisions, about management, etc. The flipside of this openness is that you of course, have to be willing to receive the feedback, you have to recognize that while openness and feedback is highly encouraged, decisions have to get made, and actions and data are more valuable than words. At the higher level, since the company trusts employees with access to so much information, keeping such info confidential from the outside world is taken seriously.

It's a great place to work as an engineer. You're given a lot of freedom, but it's also a responsibility to make sure you're doing things that are valuable. You don't get much credit for working hard or being smart if you don't produce valuable output.

One cool thing about Facebook, in contrast to other comparable companies (Google, Amazon, and Microsoft, though in truth, FB is much smaller), is how they have a pretty singular focus. Even with the differing areas (including advertising and such), they do a good job of keeping their eye on their mission of connecting as many people as possible. I also think they are way more empathetic to their users than most people give them credit for. It seems like popular opinion has it that FB is arrogant and only cares about its users insomuch as they represent $-signs. From within the company, it didn't feel this way at all. I saw a lot of empathy towards users, and a lot effort spent to improve or things or fix broken things with no direct financial benefit. The strategy is not complex. The thinking is that if they can make FB easier and more fun to use, then more people will use it for more time each day (which will also have a network effect of attracting even more people to use it), then the advertising dollars will follow. Of course, it is true that FB wants to make the audience more accessible to advertisers as well, but there are a lot of people at FB who care about privacy and security.

They have really good infrastructure and really great ways to share the infrastructure and code. They have a lot of cool internal tools, and what they've built is really impressive, and more importantly, it helps your team build products faster without having to solve problems that someone else already solved. Every software company tries to do this, but FB seems to have been more successful with it. Perhaps it's because they're still relatively small, but if anything, I can at least say it is very cool while it lasts.

The perks and work environment are great, unless you're one of those types that can't stand open office spaces. I've worked in both a private office and open offices in multiple companies. While I do think a private office has some benefits, I mostly think it's a personal luxury for the employee and a huge waste of money for the company. I'd much rather have the money go into other areas like salary, benefits, and other workplace improvements rather than the added real estate necessary to have offices.

Of course, you've heard about the food and snacks. They have an amazing selection of great stuff, and what I like about it is that it sort of goes above and beyond expectations. Sure, some days, lunch is better than others, but I really can't complain, and the selection of drinks and snacks is amazing. It's not like you should work at FB just because of that, but it demonstrates FB's desire to make work as fun and convenient as possible.

You'll be surrounded by people who like being there. I can't think of a better environment to work in. If you have a giant ego, you may not like it as much. Respect is definitely given to those that have deep experience in the industry, and they are expected to lead others and mentor more junior employees. However, if for whatever reason, you can't perform at the level expected, no one is going to care if you did this and that at Google or shipped ten things at MS, etc.

FB also has a lot of fun events, and I made a lot of friends working there, so going to the events was fun. Also, if you're older and worried that FB is just a bunch of 22-year-olds, and that you won't fit in, I wouldn't worry about that. FB does have a lot of young employees (who are really smart btw), and it does hire a lot of people straight out of college, but it also attracts a lot of experienced engineers from other top companies like Google, MS, Amazon, etc.

Work-life-balance seemed totally normal to me. It may be different depending on your team, but I felt you could do 40-50 hours of work a week for the most part and you would be totally fine. It's about what you produce, not how hard you're working. Other team members who had children would work normal hours and go home at normal times. I didn't see any of these folks have a problem when they left early to take care of their child or things like that. Of course, there could be times that people are expected to work extra if something critical happens, but for the most part everyone wants to avoid this and this happens sparingly, from what I observed. Now, there were many times where I chose to work late myself, but I never felt any pressure to do so. The caveat is that there are on-call rotations, and in addition, even if you are not on-call, you are expected to be reasonably available if the on-call person needs your help. However, again, no one wants this, and your team will work on ways to avoid these situations.

The best thing I can say is that working at FB is about productivity. I didn't experience and political bs and it was a pleasure working with a group of people who were all concerned with producing a good product and making the best of the time spent while doing it.","FB expects a lot out of engineers, and you can't slack off. Of course, you shouldn't slack off at any job, but since FB is pretty fast-paced, there is a risk that you'll have trouble adjusting at first.

FB has a lot of custom infrastructure and tools, and prehaps more impressively, it works great. It makes doing your job really great, but on the other hand, you'll end up learning a lot of stuff that won't be applicable elsewhere.

FB's code-base is very good in some ways, but in other ways, it's not as great as some of the existing engineers think it is. I don't think this is that big of a deal, but the important part is that as an engineer, you need to quickly learn FB's values and practices and ""get with the program"" so to speak. If you don't like some things, then you just have to deal with it, as it's not likely you're going to change people's minds at this point. The nice thing is that things are at least very consistent.",nil
2,"- Incredible benefits 
- Excellent compensation that rewards strong performance 
- Lots of autonomy 
- Tons of room for growth
- Very transparent from the top down
- Strong leadership
- Intelligent and caring colleagues
- The most fair and well thought out review process you will find everywhere 
- Exciting work","- If you don't learn to make the work life balance work for you, it can be exhausting. But you'll also be given lots of support with this if you ask for it. 
- It doesn't matter how good you are at your job, chances are you're going to be surrounded by a ton of other people who are just as good if not better. Imposter syndrome is real, but if you got an offer, you probably belong here too.",nil
3,"I'm a 55 year old working in a company where the average age is 28, and I've never been happier. I have always wanted to work in a company where I wasn't the proverbial square peg, and after nearly 30 years in the work force, I believe that I have found the company that complements my ideology for how a company should operate. Here are the ""Pros"" as I see them...

- Leadership:  Mark Zuckerberg, Sheryl Sandberg, Chris Cox and the rest of the leadership team. Inspiring, smart and totally real.
- The Culture:  The openness is a real thing, we're trusted to do the right thing, mistakes are expected, being yourself is important and encouraged, humility is encouraged and expected, building trust is paramount, the mission of making the world a more open and connected place isn't just a cool phrase because it guides everything. It's not about us, it's about everyone else.
- The People:  Smart and nice is what I find. The diversity is better than any other company I've worked at and it's getting better. Those that are figuring out how to make what we do better for everyone are really good at implementing their ideas. Two years ago I didn't know what this company really was or if it had a secure future. I can clearly see now that they have what it takes to last, and it's sincere.
- Management:  Managers are hired because they're good managers and not because they're good at something else. The management track is different than the contributor track and they're equal in importance.
- Benefits:  Working in the Valley it's hard to differentiate all the benefits employees receive and Facebook is at least equal to all the major tech companies, but coming from Seattle the benefits are nothing short of incredible.

Granted, I haven't been with the company for very long and I'm still in the honeymoon period, but I can tell what's real and what's not; this place is for real.","Like any tech company, the work is big and complicated so work/life balance can suffer from time to time. The difference is that it's the passion within the individuals that drives them to work long hours and forego time off. Of course there can be times when schedule demands force the imbalance, but it's not such that 10-12 hours days become commonplace and expected regardless. We do what we do to get the job done; no one is killing themselves because there's an order to do so.

Being able to eat to your hearts/stomachs content can be dangerous to the waistline, but that's a self-control thing and not the company's issue.",nil
4,"Facebook deeply cares about its employees and has built a compelling culture around support and growth. Career growth opportunities are plentiful. If you don't like the team you're on or don't get the support you want from your manger, Facebook empowers you to find new teams or projects. Facebook wants its employees to be invested in their work and to feel connected to its larger mission. If large scale opportunities and growth are important to you, Facebook is a fantastic place to work.",Facebook's culture is demanding and fast paced. The greatest aspect of working at Facebook is that everyone is very motivated and very smart. The problem with this is that they all expect the very same of you. Holding a very high bar for excellence can certainly be demanding so it's important to make sure you're always carefully paying attention to your own personal work/life balance.,nil
5,"Overall, love the people I work with, love Meta's dedication to DEI in all we do, and we have an interesting value proposition for the future.","Huge lack of planning org-wide. This leads to continous layoffs/uncertainty and lots of duplication of work/inefficient processes. Also still fighting a culture that has been bottom up for so long, which in terms of being impactful and getting things done that benefit the business, not just individuals, makes things difficult as a manager.",nil
6,Overall great place to work. They truly invest in their people. Had some of my best managers here. A lot of room to be an entrepreneur and feel a sense of ownership over your career.,"Before their layoffs, the company was also too fragmented in terms of roles and responsibilities. It made it difficult to find your place and feel like you offer value. Company also changed priorities a lot which became discouraging after awhile because it was difficult to feel like you could accomplish anything.",nil
7,"You get what you expect - Really great benefits like one of the best healthcare I've seen in the US corporate world, stipends, great 401k match, great in office amenities, supportive ERGs, pretty good work-life balance, the brand name on resume (that may no longer be so relevant in 2023). All the people you work with are incredibly talented and smart. Super inclusive and diversity minded - everyone is open minded and respectful. Career opportunities are abound (lateral transfers and team changes) but you will have to be very sharp, politically savvy, and patient for a promotion. 3+ years wait for a promotion is not uncommon. If you came from start up environment this would be very difficult. Most of very smart ICs with leadership aspiration leave because they don't see themselves climbing or losing their life to compete in the pool. Good thing is I've seen everyone move on to higher paying jobs at arguably more fun companies after 2 years or so if you are fine with job hopping then this should be good!","Same.. You get what you expect from a huge company with lots of 'scandals' ; always being in news for negative headlines and layoffs impact employee morale. Constant org changes and bureaucratic processes impact how fast you can get work done even though you are constantly told to move fast. Getting a tiny change out takes weeks, and because it's tiny even though it can lead to great improvement long-term, it gets deprioritized and every resource gets put in bigger, higher impact projects. So you are building sophisticated castle on shaky sandy foundation, until things break!",nil
8,Benefits are great although they may go down now that they are tightening their belt. Great comp although with stock price decline may not be any more. Opportunity to work on large scale products.,"For senior folks it's hard to find projects with good scope. The company had layoffs, even for people left behind the morale is down and indications are more people will either be managed out or leave on their down. Meta is not growing but is shrinking. They still suffer significantly from being short term impact driven in PSC process, they've been trying to change this for years, even removed the Move Fast / Break Things and replaced with Long term. Problem is most of the folks in calibration and running the show still have short term impact in their DNA as they way they measure everything. Mark is very fixated on the meta-verse as a bet the company initiative. Problem is that he is spending soo much on it and the likely timeframe when it goes mainstream is still years out. Also the ads business is in trouble with the economy in decline and head winds from apples privacy changes, they basically need to rewrite the ads stack which will take a long time and revenue will suffer in the mean time.",nil

49,"I just left Google and joined Facebook, and felt so much happier. The reasons are:

1. The real impact
At Google I joined a team whose product is only used by less than 1000 people, and even for that product I was assigned to do a peripheral part, whose functionality actually doesn't matter at all. Just for that module, I had to write unit test for every silly part of the code, and took long iteration cycles. I admit those are good engineering coding trainings, however taking precious time in my life to work on something that doesn't matter is just a waste of my life.

In Facebook things just move so much faster. There are standard software engineering review process but not as rigid. Just during training (boot camp) weeks, I had tasks to change very important part of Facebook's core code, and the second day after I check-in my code, it got shipped to almost 1 billion people. As a software engineer I cannot recall a moment I felt better for my job.

Then I joined a team that's extremely important to Facebook's revenue. A mistake in the code I changed could cause Facebook million dollar a day. However Facebook just trusted us, allowed us making mistake and having quick iteration cycles to test ideas fast. If I make a coding mistake in my team in Google it might cost Google nothing in terms of revenue as my product was small, however the development process was so strict I could not have chance to try my innovations or test my ideas. But in Facebook that's all possible.

2. The organizational structure
Google's organization is now very structured and hierarchical. Facebook is having more layers, but the working style is still flat, and social-network style. Speaking to people in different teams, form an idea, lead a virtual team and complete it, this style is still valued. My boss is more like a mentor helping me navigating through the ideas, rather than an authority telling me what to do.","1. I don't quite like the office decoration style.

 - Amazon is built, quite deliberately, to be Darwinian.  You can generally expect that anyone who's been here for more than 2 years is competent and motivated or they wouldn't have survived.  You can count on them as long as your priorities are aligned.  There aren't many slackers here, and they don't survive long.
  - We work on so much stuff that there's always an opportunity to find amazing cool stuff to work on (note that it's an 'opportunity', one that you have to pursue)
  - A chance to make a huge difference
  - A place where you can learn a lot about all kinds of things, both technical and about yourself
  - Amazon encourages high mobility - even your manager can't prevent you from moving to another team within 6 weeks (normally, more than a few months under unusual conditions).
  - Your friends and family have actually heard of the place you work and have at least a vague notion of what Amazon does without you having to explain","- You're responsible for your own career progression and finding the places and teams that are doing the stuff you want to do. No one is going to take you by the hand and help you with that.
- Amazon is built, quite deliberately, to be Darwinian. The strong survive and the weak perish (metaphorically speaking) and the 'bar' is constantly increasing. The level of performance that would have been acceptable five years ago will get you canned today.  It's a kind of crucible that'll help you develop a harder edge, if you can survive, that can serve you well in your career and in life, but it's often not a pleasant experience.

I wouldn't recommend it as a place to work for just anyone.",nil
494,"I've been at Amazon for a month now, and I've seen none of the horror stories being communicated to the public, although Amazon is a large enough company that I'm sure there are good pockets and bad pockets. Everyone here is really smart, and wants to succeed both personally, and as a company. People collaborate and help each other, focus on data, and truly focus on the customer. Every company I've ever worked for talks about how important the customer is, but on day 2, they're forgotten. Amazon seems to genuinely focus on what's best for the customer, and it's awesome to be in meetings where people actually bring that up, and make decisions focused on long-term customer satisfaction.

The opportunities to learn here are literally unlimited, and the opportunity to take on new responsibility is as well. I honestly believe you can be as awesome as you want here.","No cons, so far - seriously. Like I said, I'm sure Amazon has some bad pockets in it here and there, but this is an amazing job, an amazing opportunity, and the biggest thing I have to complain about is that it's a little chilly in our building. I can live with that.

Does Amazon demand high quality, measurable results? Yes! Is it hard work? Yes! Is it rewarding? Yes! So I'm not calling that a 'con'. Work/life balance seems comparable to other places I've worked - not worse.",nil

496,This company gets A list performance from C list employees.  The culture is quick and hard charging.  You are always working in relevant and meaningful projects.,"Maybe because the company recruits C listers who have neither merit (intelligence, strategic vision) nor pedigree (academic or professional accomplishments), most of those who become successful do so in treacherous, low cunning ways.

Imagine the Lannisters in Game of Thrones attacking the Starks in Game of Thrones; or Rawls and Burrell attacking McNulty and Daniels in The Wire; or Barrow and O'Brien attacking Mr Bates in Downton Abbey.  This is every day leadership behavior at Amazon.  The culture at Amazon is so infested with these middling talent weasels who have juked the stats and schemed their way to positions of power that new employees coming in actually start thinking that this behavior is normal and expected if you want to ""manage people.""

The work itself was stimulating and fulfilling, but the sneering condescension of the d bags that cheated and skated their way through high school and party colleges, then just converted their winky nod nod good 'ol boy shenanigans into a ""ask no questions, have no introspection"" company culture have made manifest some of the worst criticisms of capitalism.  Any left leaning political aspirant would look at this business organism and immediately have content to lash out against the corruption that can come in free enterprise where hard work is not rewarded, and the connected, incestuous, privileged class lounge their way to wealth while treating their employees and customers like some kind of filth their shoe picked up on the street.",nil

498,"Disclaimer: My opinions reflect that of an SDE in Amazon. Seems like some operational job functions are very tough.

I have read through some of the other Amazon reviews and it seems to me that everyone has a very different experience! This is so true. Within the same team, you can have both workaholics and slackers coexisting and coworking together. I think I am more of the balanced type as I try to stay sane. The Amazon experience is basically the entire spectrum and it is what you make it out to be.

Pros in Amazon certainly excludes great benefits, but compensation is competitive. Free food means average quality free coffee, once in a while free pizza for lunch where it is a working lunch, and free beer and finger food in special events. We get a free Orca card to take any bus in the Seattle area for free. $160 per month subsidy for office parking, which is better than nothing. Downtown monthly parking goes for about $200 per month. 401K contribution is 50% of what you put in, where you can put in max 4% of your salary. Not so great. Staff cafeteria food is average and not at all cheaper than outside food, or could be even more expensive. It is hard not to complain about the cafeteria. Vacation days are ok but note that there are no sick leaves. They count as part of your 5 personal days per year. Listing the benefits of Amazon is like listing the cons and not the pros.

Work life balance seems to be ok for the most part, and seems to be individually-driven. No one will tell you that you have to come in at what time and stay till what time. I have team mates working every night and weekend, and others getting in at 10am and leaving at 5pm, all in the same team. Managers will focus on your project deliveries instead of how much time you spend working. If you work 40-hour weeks productively, you can definitely outperform someone who works 60-hour weeks but don't deliver stuff. Working less than 40 hours per week is somewhat common, but I can't say how many people are working how long. The view on work life balance is a bit skewed. All it comes down to are the managers and what they think. Projects are always never-ending but I have found that deadlines are very realistic and reasonable, without counting your nights and weekends. Getting some slack time once in a while is probably a sign of a healthy work environment. Everyone needs a break.

On-call really really sucks. Basically all it comes down to is having SDEs double-duty as support operations engineers. Note that on-call does not improve the code quality of any team in any way. The on-call experience is particularly bad because you are using services from some other team, and their code is of low quality and fails for the wrong reasons. If the managers had given more time to up the quality, there would not be so many problems. Software is usually delivered with a tough deadline with code that meets the minimum quality bar and never gets improved for the next few years. The code review process does not seem to help improve the code but it really obstructs developers from making great changes as unconventional things will not pass code review in clumsy minds. Innovation and excellence are not the name of the game in Amazon. Searching through the Amazon code base is usually not going to turn up quality code that you can actually reuse.

Integration is the name of the game in Amazon. You will need to spend a lot of time to figure out how to integrate your code with another team's services. Whether these other people are cooperative is a hit-or-miss. I have found that most people are responsive and helpful, but there are also quite a number of jerks who are out to make trouble for everybody. It is not easy to work across teams but the experience is mostly positive.

Amazon is a huge behemoth and is hiring people like there is no tomorrow. This reflects well on a good growth momentum but also is worrying that the company is not turning much profit. If the company does not make money, where is our bonus going to come from? You can see new faces around the Amazon building almost everyday! Downside is that we are taking in a lot of average to above-average engineers and being an Amazonian SDE certainly does not share the same reputation as the top names. Amazon is a huge mixed bag of some very talented people and some very dumb people. I think the world is not turning up enough SDEs and the only way is for quality to go downhill.

As an SDE, expect to spend most of your time talking, writing emails and documents, and maybe around 20-30% of your time coding. In most of the teams, you can work on interesting projects, but probably not revolutionary ones. Note that Amazon is a very down-to-earth company and the work is very down-to-earth as well. You will work on real things that people have actually requested for, and that people will start using as soon as you are done. Work is challenging but not to expect highly technically complex stuff. Most of the work has to do with solving everyday problems. To me, this seems to make sense because I have ever tried working on experimental projects before elsewhere and I did not feel it was a good use of my time.

Internal mobility is a key strength of Amazon, and I am not sure which company has done better than Amazon in this aspect. Internal moves are easy. You only need to stay in your team for a year before moving to a different team. There is no easy way to tell which team is a good team to move to because they all have their different pros and cons and people and coming and leaving all the time!

Seattle is by much rumour an easier place to live than the Bay area.

Overall Amazon is a tough but yet sane place to work. The flexibility of this company is really its core strength. You have the freedom to excel as much as you want and also to slack as much as you want. Bummer. You shouldn't be slacking!","Beware of bad managers and horrible team mates. They are not specific to Amazon but they do exist in Amazon.

I have to admit that Monday is usually a blue day at Amazon and it is very tough to look forward to getting into office. I don't know anyone in Amazon who looks forward to getting in on Mondays.

Be realistic about SDE requirements. Coding skills are good to have but they are not the most important part of your job. I think we are hearing the same thing from every company.

Medical coverage is average or below average. Expect to pay about $60 per month for singles and about $240 per month for families. $240 per month for families gives you $3000 in medical fees before you have to pay (more) anything out-of-pocket.

SDE advancement is unreal difficult. They have about 6 levels total, SDE 1-4, then Senior Principal Engineer, and finally Distinguished Engineer. The number of SDE 1s and 2s are huge. Trying to get to SDE 3 seems to be all-of-a-sudden extremely difficult, but not impossible. So this essentially means that if you come to Amazon as a fresh grad SDE, expect to get about only one or two promotions in your entire career, which obviously is quite a lame expectation and reality. You will probably do much better in your career advancement anywhere else.

Employee retention is horrible. I am not sure why the philosophy seems to be trying to undercut existing employees and then hire from external sources. Management all say that they are trying to retain people, but actions don't seem to suggest anything better. Rumour has it that annual pay raises are horrible. This basically mean that either you are a superstar in the company before they will try to retain you, or if you are smart you should not stay in Amazon for too long.",nil
499,"Great starting pay and the ability to get raises very quickly. Full training in all areas are offered and if your willing to work hard and sweat everyday for 10 hours a day, 4 days a week, then this is the job for you.

Beat benefits as well once you are a hired on as a full time employee.","After 3 years of working with the company you ""cap out"" at $15.75, meaning you can no longer make any more money than that as a tier 1 associate.

Best way to maintain your production and achieve the fastest time is by waiting till break and never stop stowing The biggest Con for me was during my time of employment I was dealing with depression and mental health problems due to losing one of the greatest friends/mentor, my sister who left behind a beautiful daughter. Sense this was the most traumatic thing that's could possibly happen I took a medical leave for a mental health program at Bradford. Well after completing the course I uploaded my documents to return to work. And the ERC Kept requesting more info and my doctor wouldn't allow it says that's all the information they need so after 4 months of being off the schedule I finally got erc to accept it but then my a to z app never put me back on the schedule. Which obviously has nothing to do with me but they insisted that I missed over 30 days of work and said I must either resign or get fired",nil
502,"The pay is great, and every six months you get a raise. Even if they are small, it still is better than no raise at all. You can access benefits from day one, and they are VERY good benefits.

They also offer the Career Choice program for associates to upskill and pursue other worthwhile opportunities.",The company indoctrinates you at every opportunity with their core values and then hides behind them without ever actually displaying any of them. There is zero real empathy for associates and nothing but constant placation. They tell they general public they favor Veterans and promote from within but the truth is the majority of all leadership are external hires with shiny new degrees and virtually little to no actual real-world or life experience. Insult to injury; YOU will be the ones responsible for training your leaders in their new roles while THEY reap a pay structure and compensation you'll never collect on. Even if you grow organically from within and are promoted to their rank you will NEVER bring home what they do with their overly generous compensation packages. If you display any modicum of competence they will trap you in your role and constantly over-leverage you knowing they can delegate everything they are either too lazy or inexperienced to complete themselves. The majority of them lack any time management or accountability whatsoever and promotions are largely based on politics and favoritism NOT your work-ethic and accolades. Any attempt to disagree and commit (a company leadership principle) will be met with hostility and their every effort to supplant you ensuring you never prosper within their organization. Be wary of all the empty promises they shower upon you as more often than not it is a ploy that will never see fruition despite your myriad efforts to go above and beyond their unrealistic expectations.,nil

You could be done in 5 or you are working 10-12 hours.

Peers I have met bring different experiences to the table.

This can be unfortunate and challenging if you are use to getting promoted based on time. This isn't true for AWS. To be honest, it isn't that way at any startup or software company. The other con is that the onboarding is geared for the lowest level, so if you come with deep experience in cloud and tech, it can be a chore as it feels like review addition and subtraction.

I wanted to quit after my 2nd month there. No one cares about you, from the day 1 it's sink or swim, no one will train you, you have to figure things out on your own, and if you make a mistake, it's all over for you. Super high turnover, in 6months I was on my 2nd manager, 3rd director, most of my teammates are new, less than a year, and already miserable. All of the rumors you read/hear are true in my experience. Maybe I just had bad luck and landed on the wrong team, but I doubt it. Amazon pays you a sign on bonus in a lump sum in year 1 as an incentive not to quit within your first 12 months as an attempt to lower turnover rate If you resign you'll have to pay it back prorated, so if you join, demand that your sign on bonus is paid monthly.

A lot of complaining about the work load mostly from the younger generation. "" F this place N word"" was their mantra, heard it every morning. I would tell them ""just think of it as you are getting paid to workout!"" Because they have a vending machine with gear in case you lose yours, people tend to abuse this and not keep tracked of their equipment. Parking lot would get littered with gloves and vests. If you were a fast and efficient worker they would move you around to pick up the slack of the slower employees. Some of these people were barely working making it frustrating for the people like myself who were scanning 3x the packages they were for the same pay. Management or the leaders they had on the floor were mostly young and were not trained to be leaders or have a proper work etiquette. We all have name tags and one of these young punks kept saying ""hey you, yeah you"" to me on several occasions when I advised him my name is on the tag and to address me properly and respectfully or don't address me at all. He no longer called on me from that time on, nor did he apologies. I was a warehouse manager for 8 years before working in IT and never treated my workers like they were cattle. Another big problem is some of these people were not even competent enough to scan the freight onto the pallet. Normally first box gets scanned to the pallet it goes to and after that you can scan freight to the box already on the pallet. This process was challenging for some and if you are working with this person then you usually get pulled aside with them even though you weren't at fault. I would now have not only scan my freight but rescan their freight in. I tried to explain this to leadership and advise who was the problem but, they rather pull a whole group aside instead of the the individual making the mistake. Bottom line when you scan something in right, it has a different tone beep and goes green showing it was scanned successfully and it does the opposite if you don't scan it in properly.

At times Amazon can feel like a huge Adult Highschool. We have high standards on hiring external talents, but will promote anyone internally to the same position (AMs) with no experience. Too many internal politics inside the FC. Lack of diversity in high roles this includes women and POC. At times it’s like real talent is not valued. Amazon will promote anyone in any role just based off seniority and not talent. You really don’t need a degree to do this job. All you need is really good people skills.

I can tell you that if you are hired as an L4 Manager an make it 1 year promotion L5 role is a given performance really don’t matter. Most managers are L5 and everybody want’s to be an L6 yet lack experience to do the role.

Base salary accounts for less than half of “target” compensation.
RSU grants don’t start to vest for 2 years. If you leave the company before then, for any reason whether voluntary or involuntary, they’re gone and go back into the company’s pocket.
Company assumes that RSUs will appreciate by 15% annually, and this assumption is used to justify granting fewer shares during compensation planning. When the stock fails to grow by 15% annually (including when it actually drops by 50%) the company will do absolutely nothing to even acknowledge the financial pain, let alone attempt to make you whole.
When stock is growing more than 15% annually, Amazon will deduct the excess growth from future RSU grants to ensure you don’t get paid “too much”. So much for rewarding high performance!

Add to that the opaque performance management process, the stack ranking (which they deny by hiding behind target percentages for various performance ratings) and the cut throat culture.

Very fast paced and you are always working (even on vacation you have to be available).,nil
613,"Career opportunities are amazing. This a fast paced business, you are NOT going to be looking at your watch all day. There is a diverse workforce in all aspects. You will mostly do work with challenge. World class benefits.","Work life balance can be an issue. Hasn't been yet for me, but can be. Training up front (online courses) are too heavy in the culture and not your actual job role. Must be a fast learner- most of my job primary job functions I've learned because someone told me; there were no guides or notes. They used to exist, but seems they are all two years or more old. Job is not as physically demanding as I thought, but I have gone 10-11 hours without sitting down. As other reviews have stated- this is not a job where someone is likely to come to you and tell you what a great job you are doing. If you are self motivated, you can not only do well at your site, but you likely are going to start networking to move onward in a career path that you can excel in. That job will be all on YOU.",nil

Promotions seem to come slower than promised. You get threatened with being fired if you don't address your Ops managers fast enough. And the open door policies that Amazon claims to uphold get swept under the rug because the Ops managers and HR have some type of hierarchy over everyone else. And if you aren't in the group then you are looked down upon and treated as a lower class citizen to Amazon.",nil

Great job for gaining experience that looks attractive on applications.",Sometimes your metrics may be negatively affected by factors outside of your control (such as your customers not liking a policy change that was made at a corporate level.) and this will reflect poorly on you.

624,"Love the team I work with! Everyone is super nice and very available to help with any questions I might have. They really make sure to set you up for success by giving you several weeks to work your way through the training materials, and start you off slowly with positions. One of the reasons I left my previous employer was there were zero growth opportunities. At Amazon, it feels limitless. There are so many teams and chances to grow that it is really exciting to think about where your career can go. I don't feel pigeon holed, and I'm really excited to see where I can go here.","Although I wrote about the training materials in the Pros section, it can also be seen as a Con just by the sheer amount of information there is. There is so much that it becomes a project all by itself to make sure you are staying organized and can find the information later (I wish I would have started a digital notebook earlier on to help organize everything). There has also been so much change that it has been a little difficult to really get into a rhythm. My manager left to another team two weeks in, we merged with another organization 1 month in, and I switched the tech teams I was supporting twice.

A typical night is 12+ hours because of all the meetings and activities they have managers participate in both before and after the associates' shift ends. If you plan on joining Amazon and moving around frequently; don't do it. I had hopes of that, and was even told by several people in the recruiting process that it was pretty much the norm. Shortly after I came on-board, they released a policy that restricts managers from moving until they have been in the same role and at the same site for a year. I never would have accepted the offer if I knew that was coming. They refused to grandfather managers who were already hired before the policy came out.",nil
627,"- If you have a good manager, Amazon can be a great experience. The times I had good managers, I was able to do great work and get the resources I needed. - Lots of resources for training, skill improvement, etc. - A very robust remote work system - obviously of only limited usefulness because they want people in the office three days a week, but on days when you do work outside your office, the system works incredibly well. It's even good enough that you can register your own laptop as an Amazon laptop and get it wiped when you're done. - The on-call process is surprisingly pleasant. Each team member takes a 1-week turn with on-call, and if your code is built so that breaking changes are difficult to get into prod (which most of them are), you will very rarely be paged after hours, if at all.","- If you _don't_ have a good manager (perhaps because they don't get you, don't respect your time, can't stand up to demanding PMs) then you will have an awful experience. And unfortunately, Amazon has enough internal reorgs that you really don't have control of who your manager is. - I couldn't help but feel like I was in a cult the whole time. The ""leadership principles"" feel like dogmatic recitations, they always insisted that you were the best due to their rigorous interview process (which honestly didn't feel nearly rigorous enough after seeing it from the inside), and it was nearly impossible to have any insight into what upper management thought, especially when it came to salary and performance reviews. - Lots of theater for code changes, especially new deployments. Deploying a new microservice is very involved (as it should be), but Amazon likes to use microservices for everything. Amazon also uses a bloated OOP model for most services.",nil

Hasn't bothered me so far but if that's not your thing then it's not for you. Pro's stated, that only applies to Amazon Air, NOT AMAZON. The thing about Amazon Air is that there are generally excess staff to what is actually required on the Ramp(where planes are serviced), this goes doubly for peak seasons, so everyday a certain number of people are sent to the Amazon warehouse where the containers Amazon Air employees load onto planes are packed and unpacked. The environment here is not great to be honest, from what I've heard it's much better than standard Amazon facilities, but still not great. There are next to no windows, the majority of people don't talk to each other, and the pace of work is consistently inconsistent. Basically a lot of standing around occasionally grabbing boxes off a belt, sometimes it's faster paced, sometimes slower. I find this kind of work tedious and mind numbing, maybe you won't. But if you're someone who likes to keep busy, or someone who likes to just relax, I doubt doubt warehouse work will appeal to either. Management is ok to poor here, you are treated as a drone by most managers, but some are cool.

I developed carpal tunnel syndrome working for Amazon which made it painful to work. They denied accommodations and required me to write down (re writing the same answer 3 different ways) until it sounded like I had injured myself elsewhere “in my own words.” They changed the time-off policies with no notice which caused and unprecedented drop in hours for me and then would not approve my medical leave for seeing a doctor trying to get accommodations. This caused me to go negative in hours and I received emails saying they would fire me soon. I pleaded with HR, who are two uneducated women who do not care about the employees and will make no attempt to help. All of my superiors knew it caused me pain to work and I was told “No” personally when asking for them to please help me by every level of superior I was able to talk to. I can’t use my right arm hardly at all now and I still can’t get a job. They made sure I swore it wasn’t them after I told them it was and then said they’d fire me and would not offer accommodations. ON TOP OF THIS, my login was immediately invalidated when I resigned, so I don’t have access to my W2. That’s right, they won’t even send me a physically copy and are denying access to the digital one because guess what? It’s not their problem. I’ve already contacted the same HR team I was looking forward to never having to talk to again and do no expect to hear back. This was my third Amazon location and they just keep getting worse.

AWS really gives you the time you need to learn about the company and how to be successful at your job. There are a lot of valuable skills you can develop due to the wide array of services AWS offers. The promotional track is also among the best I've seen. Promotions are objective and based almost solely on your work performance. You can grow within AWS or you market the skills in the open market.,"AWS is its own universe of services and technologies apart from any other organization you may have experience with in the past. Upon hire you may not be placed where your skills and experience align best. You are placed where there is company need.

There is no room for complacency and the rate of growth is astonishing. The leadership principles are not just a corporate statement, they really are the norm here. And they make you feel very empowered once you internalize them. If you are looking for professional growth and endless opportunities, this company is miles ahead than others I've known. Most importantly, you are compensated for what you do in a very data-driven way, there is no convoluted paths for promotion and the culture is almost of an almost utopian meritocracy.","Not a con per se, but I have known many people who are just looking for a 9-17 job, same same every day, a comfortable safe position in a giant company. This is not what Amazon is about. We want you to grow from day one. The company has a place for people of all walks of life, but you have to be ambitious, driven and willing to put the effort. Sometimes it is hard to be motivated by a greater purpose of the company. I would say that the best outcomes of Amazon to the world are by-products of its core services (setting a legitimate customer-oriented standard for corporations, promoting an engaging and inclusive work environment, enabling people to do more dignified jobs by automating trivial work, optimizing logistics and distribution of goods with technology, etc...). In my position there is a lot of business travels, so make sure to align the expectations with your family and yourself.",nil

But it was nice to be acknowledged since there were so many people working there. if you are a good worker you can pretty much work where you want or were you are most efficient but also be prepare to be pulled away if they need you somewhere else. especially if you are considered one of the more efficient workers.","It can be a toxic environment. A lot of complaining about the work load mostly from the younger generation. "" F this place N word"" was their mantra, heard it every morning. I would tell them ""just think of it as you are getting paid to workout!"" Because they have a vending machine with gear in case you lose yours, people tend to abuse this and not keep tracked of their equipment. Parking lot would get littered with gloves and vests. If you were a fast and efficient worker they would move you around to pick up the slack of the slower employees. Some of these people were barely working making it frustrating for the people like myself who were scanning 3x the packages they were for the same pay. Management or the leaders they had on the floor were mostly young and were not trained to be leaders or have a proper work etiquette. We all have name tags and one of these young punks kept saying ""hey you, yeah you"" to me on several occasions when I advised him my name is on the tag and to address me properly and respectfully or don't address me at all. He no longer called on me from that time on, nor did he apologies. I was a warehouse manager for 8 years before working in IT and never treated my workers like they were cattle. Another big problem is some of these people were not even competent enough to scan the freight onto the pallet. Normally first box gets scanned to the pallet it goes to and after that you can scan freight to the box already on the pallet. This process was challenging for some and if you are working with this person then you usually get pulled aside with them even though you weren't at fault. I would now have not only scan my freight but rescan their freight in. I tried to explain this to leadership and advise who was the problem but, they rather pull a whole group aside instead of the the individual making the mistake. Bottom line when you scan something in right, it has a different tone beep and goes green showing it was scanned successfully and it does the opposite if you don't scan it in properly.

Most of the time, Ops will come around and make the necessary changes without putting up a fight. Know when to move on by transferring to another site. This is very site and Business Unit specific. The grass truly is greener at other sites.","When I started with Amazon, the principle ""You own your career"" was encouraging and motivating. Career opportunities are stunted by lack of shift rotation for proper exposure to the site leaders, and lack of experience level by managers that don't know how to recognize talent and Develop the Best. Req's are often filled before they are opened, and it has become about ""Who you know"" instead of what you have accomplished and what you have to contribute. This creates barriers for those that are ready to be promoted, relocating, looking to transfer, etc. Amazon needs to get back to the pre-Covid standards across the board. It's time for us to ""Return to Normal"" starting with the associate cell phones not being allowed on the FC floor.

All tasks were timed. 1-2 minute breaks in-between tasks (bathroom, getting water) were not actually able to be taken if daily goal was to be reached (you could physically take the break but the task clock would be running). Several teammates worked off the clock on the down-low to actually meet their goals to avoid being penalized, further inaccurately supporting managements productivity expectations. Goals for productivity and sales would change with little notice. Many members of the team were put on coaching plans to improve how fast they could work, or fired for not being fast enough. The more like a computer you were, the better. - Went from flexible hourly schedule to schedule-bidding based on stack-ranking. Teammates who were needing supplementary income (due to our low pay) had to leave part-time evening jobs and work odd shift times, or quit. - No internal growth opportunities after 3+ years on the team. Limited growth opportunities to move to other teams in different job functions (team was ranked as L3 but considered corporate). - Limited yearly raise for top performers, no raise for cost of living adjustment. Essentially, a pay-cut in the final years due to rising inflation and cost of living in one of the nation's most expensive cities. No severance packages (these specific attributes apply to THIS team, not Amazon teams as a whole). - Lack of communication from upper management on program direction or changes.

985,"- organized, structured, and corporatey: instruction manuals for literally every task, and clear order of operations for every single interaction you had. This made the job easy, if monotonous, for people who do well with structure, and frustratingly rigid for those who didn't enjoy structure/rules. 

- benefits were really what made it worthwhile to work there: great stock options, discounts on apple products, industry discounts on phone service plans","- poor scheduling practices: lead to inflexibility and inequality of hours and times 

- poor management and leadership: led to petty store politics, cliques, and favoritism. Often did not feel supported by management, and resorted to working with heads of department or coworkers for problems that management could have handled easily. 

- pay and raises: incredibly frustrating pay system. Salary was based on a rigid formula of performance, position, cost of labor (not cost of living) in your area, and the salary you started with. There was no nuance or humanity or sensibility to the way employees were paid. It was all up to the pay formula equation. So for example, store transfers and new hires would frequently make 20%–40% more per hour than employees with the same job who had been working at the store for many years, because their starting salary was higher (whether from starting in a location with a higher cost of labor, or starting more recently after a minimum wage had increased).

(I ended my tenure at $20/hr) Prior to this I worked at Hollister, Target, Verizon, and Best Buy. This is, by far, the best retail experience you can have. Education reimbursement is what allowed me to leave retail altogether.","Very very busy most of the time. There weren't many days where we could just 'stand around'.

The feedback culture is completely corrupted, using extremely broad competencies to justify promotions for their favorite employees over skilled employees.",nil

I've learned so much, training was more about what the company was about and what it stands for. I learn about the products and services a few days after the main training days. Employment and interview process is very intricate to ensure that the best hard workers would be given the chance to share their knowledge on the sales floor while also continuing to learn and grow from every interaction.","Since I was on a seasonal contract, I wish that they were given more room to expand and keep seasonal workers longer. In most cases they can, but due to how the economy is like right now, it is something they have to do with the company.

The hours can be long, but it depends where you're at in your life.

994,"The culture of Apple is great, especially at the Brea location. There was an emphasis on being open with co workers and pushing each other to be better. Many of the managers are also great and there to listen to their staff while also stepping in when needed to help during busy times.","I do suspect that males were getting paid better walking in the door, however I believe it balanced out with bonuses and raises IF you were an 'above and beyond' female employee. If you did your job right and were there without a future plan to stay, males seemed to be paid more than females. Also, do not recommend if sales is cringe-y to you. I got through it but it very much is a sales based job and some people don't believe it until they are there.",nil

Benefits: amazing; benefits team actually does listen to employees and has implemented new benefits or changed old ones to make them more favorable for employees Incentives: ESPP and stock options that vest yearly, nice discount on products The name: honestly being able to say you work or worked for Apple opens a lot of doors that would otherwise be closed or much more difficult to open otherwise","It’s retail: inconsistent schedules which makes it incredibly hard to maintain any sort of routine or to make appointments without constantly inputting in off requests Customers: most of them are great, but the bad ones really put a sour taste in your mouth. There is a level of elitism with some customers that I haven’t experienced in other jobs, both pre and post-employment with Apple. NPS: it’s a useful tool to measure performance but too much stock is put into it considering how easy it is to drop a score. I’ve had my NPS score drop because even though the customer said my service was “impeccable”, the music in the store was too loud so they gave me a passive instead of a promoter. One detractor or passive survey drops a score so much that you have to get 5-10 promoters to make up for it. There is no appeals process to have the survey not count. It affects your numbers and can affect your raise/performance when review time comes around. Unrealistic expectations: I worked at the Genius Bar. By the time I left we were expected to take 3-4 appointments per hour where we were expected to not only troubleshoot/diagnose/resolve/check in for repair devices, but to also talk up AppleCare+, get a new business intro, talk about new products and upgrades, answer all customer questions, and learn/connect with the customer as a human. All of that CAN be done, but not in 15 minutes. That’s 1-2 appointments per hour, not 3-4. It didn’t matter how high your NPS or other metrics were, if you didn’t hit that 3-4 appointments per hour you were constantly pulled into “connections” with your connection leader to talk about it. Irritating. Leadership: inconsistent and very hit-or-miss. Some were very by-the-book and almost robotic, others were more human and understanding. Some had issues with micromanaging, no matter how many feedback conversations you had with them. Very few I felt I could actually trust. Lack of upward mobility: moving from specialist to expert is pretty easy. Anything beyond that gets significantly harder. Breaking into the corporate side is virtually impossible. Phone Support: there is a HUGE disconnect between phone support and store support. Phone support is awful, and they frequently lie and/or give incorrect information to customers, and store employees are left to clean up the mess and reset expectations.",nil

1088,Benefits are great. Discounts are decent but could be better. Pay is not the worst but should be a lot better considering Apple is a trillion dollar company.,"Not enough vacation time. You build vacation/sick time by the hours you work each pay period. Management is toxic. They will hold you to standards that they themselves don’t abide by. They come and go as they please if they even show up at all yet they still get paid because they’re salary. It’s a buddy club at the management level. You have your manager, they report to an area manager, and the area manager reports to a senior area manager. They all do the same shady thing where they collect a paycheck but barely show up so you will never see a manager get fired because all of the shady behavior is just swept under the rug and hidden from upper management. Not to mention that all these different tiers of management work mostly from home so there’s nobody above them that has eyes on them. If upper management wasn’t so clueless they’d see that there’s absolutely no reason for three different tiers of management. Upper management has recently implemented a policy in which people who were working from home even long before the pandemic are no longer going to be considered for promotions unless they move to an on-site location. Management will counter that claim by saying it’s all about who you know, and developing your skills but they don’t give you time off the phones to better yourself. The training is very poor in quality too. You will never have weekends or holidays off and if you do it’s a rarity. Also, the hours of operation are horrible. AppleCare goes by Central Time hours which is 7AM-10PM Central. What this means that if you live outside of the Pacific time zone you are working later hours which is horrible in my opinion. Forget having a work-life balance if you’re on the east coast. And here’s the worst part, your schedule is not fixed. You have to bid on a new shift every few months and that process is very convoluted because it’s based on job performance, not seniority. As far as the metrics they use to judge your performance, they’re near impossible to meet. A large part of the metrics are based on customer surveys which basically means you’re on the front lines taking bad surveys from customers who are not necessarily upset at you but are angry with Apple’s products or their policies. So you’re punished with a horrible schedule for things that are entirely out of your control. Raises are not that great. If I average out my yearly pay increase since I’ve been here it comes out to an $1.78 dollar increase each year. To me that is just not great considering the cost of living and the fact that Apple has no problem giving stock grants to privileged board members.",nil

This company will eat your soul and spit it back at you, at least in hardware engineering. Management collectively uses fear and shame-based motivation. Team members are expected to present frequently to large groups with lots of shame and hostility toward people who either do not have certain expected tasks complete, have not made proper judgment calls, do not have the full depth of analysis that is expected, etc even when one is burning themselves out working over 65 hrs a weak to try to keep up. As a DRI (directly responsible individual) you own everything and are expected to do everything, even though management may tell you that ""some things can fall through the cracks"". When you complain about ""quality of life"", they pretend to hear you, but will immediately try to convince you that you are wrong. The management actively gas-lights people when they complain, contributing the lack of time or bandwidth that one has to their own time management issues. Working here is like actively living in an insane asylum. There is no social life, it's just awkward, no one is encouraged to talk or socialize, just to get your work done. Pay is the only thing that keeps people here. For several years I have worked until 11-p or as late as 4am consistently for 4 days a weak, Fridays ending early sometimes as early as 6pm. I've seen people with children do this years on end, they have no life. The question is why? Is your true sense of self value derived so deeply from this work? It probably shouldn't be. But that's what Apple wants you to believe, ""do your life's work here"".",nil

- So many good people
- Such a great service
- Hope","I have been working for a year at Netflix.

I've seen what was supposed to be very mature people, sharing absolutely almost no contact that anyone would qualify as ""human"".
Sure, that sounds hyperbolic, let me develop (and maybe cherry-pick a little).

Have you heard about our culture? The one about giving candid feedback? - I have seen people complaining of behavior they literally demonstrated themselves in the following days.
But I have also seen these feedbacks resulting in tears both in the eyes of HR persons or fellow engineers. How human does that sound?

Have you heard about our culture? The one about not tolerating brilliant jerks? I have nonetheless seen angriness and frustration, expressed in private, public and meeting. People rejecting new ideas by default, like, any ideas they wouldn't have worked themselves on for days wouldn't count. Even if those ideas are from the best examples in the industry or academics. How many publications/contributions have you seen from Netflix to computer science in general? How does it compare against any other company of that size in the Bay Area? Can you imagine either the real insecurity (x)or the lack of innovation that could lead to this situation?

Except for a few managers, directors or VPs feeling free enough to behave at work in the same way than how they live, almost every engineer I have been interacting with, have shared as little as possible about their private life.
The rare exceptions of interpersonal exchange ends up around some sort of competitive behavior: Who is the most geeky, sportive, owns the fastest car/biggest house/visited the strangest place.

I've heard workaholic people complaining about ambitious peers who were over-managing, over-working to get even more work to do after. I feel like we're past workaholism at this point.

Maybe there are a lot of shy people! Maybe there is a culture of fear, not only of being fired, but also a fear of interacting with people going to be fired.
Maybe it's all in my head, maybe people giving 5 stars to their experience here don't care the human aspect of a company. And maybe they're right.

What about your crush, your fears, your desires for the future, your appetite for life? I've been blessed to work in enough large companies to know that the behavior that I'm seeing in Netflix is not a healthy one. I've also been lucky enough to work in other industries more socializing than tech and I can tell that Netflix has a lot to do on that side, and off-sites or team meeting won't solve that problem.

I am afraid about the tragic, but inevitable consequences of the ways people operate in this company: I guess that the day the worst will happen, it will be addressed in an impersonal memo by Reed; followed-up by 1 or 2 reminders during offsites. Possibly commented by HR in a Q&A document. And move on. This company seems as reactive in its management of people as it is proactive in its business operations.

I still work at Netflix though, not only for the paycheck, but because I hope. I hope it will change. The needed change can't happen from a candid feedback, a Q&A, or  only from inside.
Change has to come from everyone, including people who take time to read comments like this one. Netflix has so many good people and offers such a great service.

As a curious Netflix employee reading this review: think about your past, isn't there a big human thing that you would love to feel again in your current company that you've felt in the past?

As a candidate: think about what would be a good question to ask to that HR partner once your package is almost here to be offered to you, think about that comment you make at the end of an interview when you're being asked by an engineer: ""Do you have any question for me?""
What Netflix needs is an inception, something that anyone and everyone would think about after leaving the call or the room they were sharing with you.
Ask yourself, and then the others, the question you should ask if you think you want to spend a good amount of your life and energy in the place you're applying for.

- Will I learn and contribute to the knowledge of other's? Even outside the company?
- Will I see emotional responses from my peers? Will that be for other reasons than being fired or bluntly criticized?
- Will I find a friendly environment that will nurture my appetite for life?
- What is the amount of emotional interaction (celebrating, sharing, playing) to expect from a company whose service is the best to ""entertain""?
- Do androids dream of electric sheep?",nil
1472,"great benefits, best salary around, beautiful offices and you will work amongst some of the smartest folks you have ever met, plus you are talking about tv and movies all day - it's a FUN job","the company has grown rapidly over the last few years and during covid - the previous way of onboarding and building trust was much harder to achieve. I was at Netflix new many growth phases and this one is definitely the hardest - there are a ton of talent people in the marketing department that have been there a long time (e.g. more than 4 years) but not a lot of upward mobility so it feels like folks are getting restless. It has also become a much more political environment where it feels like leadership is most focused on decision making based on perception vs. what is best for the work and the teams. If you are a used to a political environment, this may not bother you.",nil
1473,"Netflix is unlike any other company I've worked at. There's a level of trust that you don't see at other companies, and the people you work with all tend to be senior-level and very capable. Because of that, there hasn't been a hierarchy among IC's; everyone leads projects and functions as a trusting peer with everyone else. It's also always been a pretty lean company with process where it's needed but not the influence of politics and bureaucracy. But both of those are slowly changing, and I fear it will soon become like every other tech company. Another pro is that the compensation is 100% salary (no bonuses or forced RSU's), and thankfully that's not changing.","Inconsistency in management across the company, the addition of levels among ICs could hinder collaboration as not everyone will be equals and a hierarchy will be created, the possible introduction of a location-based salary adjustment is unjustified (output stays the same, the company saves money with so many working remotely). Internal communication has been horrible lately, which is sad and frustrating for a company that prides itself on being open and transparent.",nil
1474,"The best part about Netflix is that they try to pay 20% more than everybody else, so the compensation is good.  They are not shy about spending money, so travel is business class, you'll get a new MacBook Pro every year, etc.  The people there tend to be very nice, the catered lunch is delicious, and so forth.  While there is still a lot of action in Los Gatos building the technology (although arguably it is becoming mature, as streaming is a commodity), the real drama is in Los Angeles, relating to content.","Netflix has very strange politics, because people's jobs are at the whim of their manager.  In other words, if a manager decides that a particular report is no longer a ""star,"" he or she will get a package.  So, given that employees are not stupid, there is a lot of kissing up, resulting in a lot of comedy.  Netflix believes in ""360 feedback,"" but everybody I know only does that to their peers, and they become very political with their management chain.",nil
1475,"Pay is great, unfortunately, layoffs came for most of us. Depending on the team and manager, the work could be really fun.","General instability of the times. Can't really fault Netflix but maybe if they stopped putting in $$ for big-budget films that are formulaic and bad, that could have saved some of our jobs. There are some great shows on the platform but also a ton of crap. Who greenlights all these projects?

It has been the most impactful role I have ever taken, and I’ll be leaning on the learnings from my time at Netflix for the rest of my career.","It is not for everyone. If you need stability, clear processes and rules, or structure - Netflix can be a very stressful place.

The fluidity and pace of change can be really hard for folks who thrive in more orderly and predictable environments.",nil
1503,The pay when all engineers were senior engineers was higher than most other companies. Most co-workers in the earlier Cloud days were great engineers and extremely helpful.,"There is a great deal of politics between Engineering orgs and even within engineering teams. Even with obviously outstanding performance, failing to play politics well will leave you unrewarded, while others with more political savvy will be rewarded for no work at all. Ultimately, the manager is free to be biased for/against employees for any reason at all.

Engineering managers in some orgs tend to be non-technical--only doing project management. Although some non-technical managers might still be good managers, there are some that are horrible, with poor project management skills, and that don't even know what is happening in their own team. Those managers tend to be employed at Netflix for many years.

There is no career development support here. It's unlikely that the current management will do any more as new (lower) engineering levels are added.

As for the 360 review, it's best to avoid giving significant negative feedback as it makes co-workers defensive. Everyone is afraid of anything negative that can lead to them being fired. HR and management advice on 360 reviews is unrealistic and self-serving. It only helps management since some managers don't know what's happening on their own teams.

Ultimately, Netflix is a large company where experiences will differ, depending on which team and organization you work in. If you change teams or managers a few times, though, you'll encounter highly toxic situations.

For new mid-level prospective employees, avoid Netflix since the lower pay is likely not worth the extreme politics and toxicity.",nil

Flexible schedules. Starting off you will be a Special Events Officer, and you choose as much or as little time and days you want to work.

Fast progress to higher positions. If you work honest and competently it will be acknowledged, and more full-time or supervisory opportunities will open.

Great for gaining security experience. If you are starting in the security field it is a good place to build time as a security officer if you want to further pursue other security opportunities.

Positions are simple and straight forward. Thank goodness the job is easy, otherwise unless you got full training you’d be SOL.","It’s easy to acquire the job. There isn’t drug testing or much of an assessment on who gets the job so just about anyone can.

No organization. When you are new you may or may not get the full 3 DAY training (I didn’t, mine was 2 hours) and good luck finding your way at any of the downtown venues on your first day. Also, working new accounts that hire City Shield are confusing even for the supervisors and takes a month or so before most not even all aspects are solid. 

Turn over rate. Since basically anyone can get in, everyone gets in and don’t have good work ethic. With that being said.

Sometimes way too strict. There needs to be rules for any establishment to work, but some rules conflict with the state of the company. When there is so much disorganization coupled with the type of employees that are hired it seems that certain rules are used to purge then rehire the same type of employee again.

1795,"- Pay. Unequivocally the best in town. Full stop. 
- Travel & Expense Policy. Nowhere else will you be allowed to effectively do whatever you want, with limited oversight and an occasional audit. Need to fly business? Book business. Need to stay in a swanky hotel. Stay in said swanky hotel. Just don't abuse it.
- Uber/Shuttles. Pre-Pandemic, of course, the company Uber account to/from work is a nice touch, though it's not great they add it to your taxable income without telling you about it. They also have shuttles all over LA to pick you up and drive you to and fro.
- Family Planning allowance. Real big high five for the $75k contribution to family planning, fertility, what have you.","- So. Many. Feelings. Good lord, be adults and do some actual work.
- Meeting-heavy culture. Every 30min chunk of your day will be full and you will get nothing done. Prepare to turn on and work late once you've eaten dinner or your kids go to bed. They know it and do nothing about it.
- Work life balance. You have no life anymore, there is only Netflix.
- Reorganizations are constant. If you want a comfortable existence in your role this is not the place for you.
- Leadership changes are constant. Since senior leadership does very little in the day to day work of building campaigns or managing talent, they make their hay moving people around the chess board like little pawns to justify their existence and politicking to get Ted's ear. It's gross, and the string of senior marketing departures validates its grossness. 
- Content is king. The Content Org that is. They can spend 20billion to make content, while Marketing panhandles on the side of the 101 for loose change to cut trailers, execute photo shoots, or do anything innovative. 
- Campaigns are teeny tiny. Unless you're a Ryan Reynolds movie, Stranger Things, or Bridgerton, you aren't getting a campaign; more a loose collection of assets geared toward keeping your talent happy. So if you're looking to build big, integrated, global campaigns, this likely isn't the place for you. Which is hard because...
- Ted promises talent a lot! So the Content and Marketing teams are between a rock and a hard place, as no one wants to tell them they aren't getting real campaigns, only token media spends and creative budgets.
- God help you if you work on a Season 2 or Sequel+. You're working with pocket lint and thoughts and prayers for resources. 
- The Culture. For a company famous for its Culture Deck, they've really let it fall by the wayside in most departments. Gone is critical, real time feedback. Gone is the pro sports team mentality. Gone is any real sense of Risk Taking or Innovation. It also is whatever anyone in Senior Leadership or HR says that it is to achieve whatever reorg or budget shortfall that's coming.
- There's no upward mobility and very little that goes into training/development. Raises are non-existent unless you go get an offer from elsewhere, in which case you're playing Russian Roulette with the ""Keeper Test."" 
- Redundancy. There are 6, maybe 7 departments that output creative? It's inefficient and it causes a ton of duplicative work.",nil

1961,"1) Food, food, food.  15+ cafes on main campus (MTV) alone.  Mini-kitchens, snacks, drinks, free breakfast/lunch/dinner, all day, errr'day.

2) Benefits/perks.  Free 24:7 gym access (on MTV campus).  Free (self service) laundry (washer/dryer) available.  Bowling alley.  Volley ball pit.  Custom-built and exclusive employee use only outdoor sport park (MTV).  Free health/fitness assessments.  Dog-friendly.  Etc. etc. etc.

3) Compensation.  In ~2010 or 2011, Google updated its compensation packages so that they were more competitive.  

4) For the size of the organization (30K+), it has remained relatively innovative, nimble, and fast-paced and open with communication but, that is definitely changing (for the worse).

5) With so many departments, focus areas, and products, *in theory*, you should have plenty of opportunity to grow your career (horizontally or vertically).  In practice, not true.  

6)  You get to work with some of the brightest, most innovative and hard-working/diligent minds in the industry.  There's a ""con"" to that, too (see below).","1) Work/life balance.  What balance?  All those perks and benefits are an illusion.  They keep you at work and they help you to be more productive.  I've never met anybody at Google who actually time off on weekends or on vacations.  You may not hear management say, ""You have to work on weekends/vacations"" but, they set the culture by doing so - and it inevitably trickles down.  I don't know if Google inadvertently hires the work-a-holics or if they create work-a-holics in us.  Regardless, I have seen way too many of the following: marriages fall apart, colleagues choosing work and projects over family, colleagues getting physically sick and ill because of stress, colleagues crying while at work because of the stress, colleagues shooting out emails at midnight, 1am, 2am, 3am.  It is absolutely ridiculous and something needs to change.

2) Poor management.  I think the issue is that, a majority of people love Google because they get to work on interesting technical problems - and these are the people that see little value in learning how to develop emotional intelligence.  Perhaps they enjoy technical problems because people are too ""difficult.""  People are promoted into management positions - not because they actually know how to lead/manage, but because they happen to be smart or because there is no other path to grow into.  So there is a layer of intelligent individuals who are horrible managers and leaders.  Yet, there is no value system to actually do anything about that because ""emotional intelligence"" or ""adaptive leadership"" are not taken seriously.

3) Jerks.  Sure, there are a lot of brilliant people - but, sadly, there are also a lot of jerks (and, many times, they are one and the same).  Years ago, that wasn't the case.  I don't know if the pool of candidates is getting smaller, or maybe all the folks with great personalities cashed out and left, or maybe people are getting burned out and it's wearing on their personality and patience.  I've heard stories of managers straight-up cussing out their employees and intimidating/scaring their employees into compliance.

4) It's a giant company now and, inevitably, it has become slower moving and is now layered with process and bureaucracy.  So many political battles, empire building, territory grabbing.  Google says, ""Don't be evil.""  But, that practice doesn't seem to be put into place when it comes to internal practices.  :(",nil
1962,"* If you're a software engineer, you're among the kings of the hill at Google. It's an engineer-driven company without a doubt (that *is* changing, but it's still very engineer-focused).
* The perks are amazing. Yes, free breakfast, lunch, an dinner every weekday. Aaaaaamazing holiday parties (at Waldorf Astoria, NY Public Library, MoMA, etc.); overnight ski trips to Vermont; overnight nature trips to the Poconos in the summer; summer picnics at Chelsea piers; and on and on and on. I don't see this going away unless the company starts hurting financially.
* Speaking of which, the company is doing quite well, which reflects in bonuses and equity grants.
* There a huge diversity of work ranging from defending independent journalism worldwide (Google Project Shield) to crisis response during disasters (see Maps during Hurricane Sandy or Tsunamis), to the best machine learning experts and projects in the world, to more mundane revenue-driving projects in advertising, there's really something for everybody.
* It's easy to move around within the company as long as you're in good standing (the vast majority of engineers are).
* The company is amazingly open: every week Larry Page and Sergey Brin host what's called TGIF where food, beer, wine, etc. is served, a new project is presented, and afterward there's an open forum to ask the executives anything you want. It's truly fair game to ask anything, no matter how controversial, and frequently the executives will be responsive.
* No, nobody cares if you use an iPhone, Facebook, shop with Amazon, stream using Spotify, or refuse to use Google+. The company is amazingly open and flexible.

Neither pro nor con, but general information on work-life balance, promotions, and advancement.
* Work life balance can be what you want it to be on most teams. (Some teams are in more competitive sectors and require more crazy hours all the time - but very few of them). If you do what's expected, you'll be fine at least for a handful of years. Working a roughly 40 hour work week is possible, and many people do it. There are also people who are hyper-motived and work like crazy just because they love it, or because they're competitive, or they want to get a promotion. If you work 40 hour weeks without putting in anything extra, you'll fall behind them as they advance and you stand still - and maybe that doesn't matter, so it works out for everybody. But at least know where you would realistically stand.
* If you excel and work your butt off, you'll be compensated and promoted. If you let yourself be a code monkey, and just sit coding with your head down all day, you'll be fine but won't advance. A big complaint from some Googlers is about not being able to advance ""even at Google"" with pure coding. Sure, if you're the uber genius who created MapReduce and Bigtable, you're going to advance like a rocket without having to do anything but coding; but if you're like most engineers at Google -- smarter than average, but just average compared to other Googlers -- you're just a good coder and not revolutionary. Code monkeys are important to actually get stuff done, and to be sure you absolutely need to be a good coder as a software engineer (it's the minimum requirement), but code monkeys won't advance because they're not leaders and they're easy to replace. To get promoted you need to lead and do more than just code. There are plenty of ways to lead other than being an official tech lead, so this isn't actually _that_ hard, so the real point is just that you can't just sit there coding what other people tell you to code all day and expect to advance.","* It *is* becoming larger, and with it comes growing pains: bureaucracy, slow to respond to market threats, bloated teams, cross-divisional tension (though nothing remotely approaching that of Microsoft's internal tension).
* The quality of the engineers is possibly dropping, but possibly not. It's hard to get real metrics, because as the absolute number of people grows, naturally the number of bad apples grows; as a percentage it's supposedly the same as it ever was, but with larger numbers of poorer quality engineers it just _feels_ like things might be changing for the worse.
* Also with growth means more internal-confidential data leaks (again, because of the raw numbers of people) -- product announcements being ruined, etc. That means the company has to be tighter-lipped internally to avoid leaks, which makes things less open. It's still an amazingly open place, but less so than it was even a couple years ago. The good thing is they recognize it and actively look to improve things because they know how important it is to keep the good culture.",nil

You'll open the paper and see your company in the news almost every day, and read about projects you're working on, which is a cool thing

You'll see Larry and Sergey at TGIF and you'll admire how they lead the company. They are brilliant, goofy, low key but intense, and likeable. 

There are 22 cafes (more or less), the food is excellent, and it's free.

Your pay will typically be competitive, though it needs to be tweaked up a bit since the economy has improved.

Google cares about how it treats its employees.

The campus is like an academic campus in many ways.

There are tons of activities on campus, like authors speaking about their books, films after work, and gyms where you can work out - but you'll need to make sure to carve out time to do these things.

You'll get plenty of external validation from people who suddenly think you're smart and rich because you work there, even if you're not rich and you're as smart when you didn't work at Google.

If and when you leave, you'll never regret having that company on your resume. It opens doors. 

The company is flexible - if you're lucky, you won't have a micromanager boss and you can be somewhat flexible in how you work - but don't get me wrong - you'll work a LOT. But you don't have to do all of it chained to your desk.","I live in SF so the commute can take between 1.5 hours to 1.75 hours each way on the shuttle - sometimes 2 hours each way on a busy day or rainy day. That means being on the bus for 3-4 hours PER DAY. It's a wired bus though which means you can work on the way to Mountain View. But it can feel brutal.

Your first year or two are really important in terms of your career at Google and they affect how you're viewed, and your ability to be promoted. You should always ask to work on high profile projects. If you don't get them, don't expect to get high ratings or get promoted. Always volunteer for cross functional group work for maximum exposure, and then work hard at those things.

You'll likely work on something that no one will explain to you and it will take you at least a year to be comfortable doing what you're working on, even if you're super quick at learning.  No one has time to train you or teach you what you're doing - which is kind of hard.

After two or three years, people you started out with at Google start to get promoted. If you're not one of them, you'll wonder why and how it happened, and that process is somewhat political and not always clear. 

It's a big company now. And super political. So don't be naive. Expect some people to be catty, some people to be territorial, and be prepared to be mentally tough. Don't let people see your vulnerableness. It's a Darwinistic culture with a huge dose of 30-something idealism on top which can fool you into thinking that people are easygoing - they're not. They're driven. If you're not driven, you're not going to fit in.

When you start at Google, it seems like peer reviews are super important - they are, but they are the sprinkles on the fro yo. The important thing is that your direct manager knows your work, likes your work and likes you, and then you can get promoted. If your boss doesn't like you, all the positive peer reviews in the world won't help you.  Make sure you know what your boss wants, and give it to them. You will have weekly one on ones, and make sure you are addressing your performance at each one, asking if they have questions, how you can improve, can you work on cross functional projects, etc.

It's really hard to find work life balance at Google. The workload is huge.   I hardly have time to work out. The commute is brutal. My family sometimes needs more from me and I can't give it. I'm still trying to find the balance. I think I need more down time than most people so I have a hard time being structured every day to fit all the things I want into my day, so a lot of things slip, like working out.",nil
1964,"I've been at Google a long time, so the financial benefits still outweigh any cons. The people I work with are still mostly great, especially most of my management chain (though one or two are no-ops).","The company was founded on psychological safety, don't be evil, hire smart creatives, etc.. Today, the company has grown so fast and so large that now the majority of people seem to be typical tech industry employees. That means most of the management has now come from outside the company, so that has killed the culture. Psychological safety is gone, especially after the way the layoffs were handled. I miss Laszlo Bock; he knew how to treat the workforce. I miss Larry, Sergey, and Eric. The general quality of my peers has gone down. Not as people, they're all lovely, but as practitioners. Most of them do what we'd have considered low-quality work 5 years ago. It's shockingly bad, really, by comparison. They've all been hired so fast and in such an environment where they weren't properly trained or didn't have the proper background to begin with or haven't been given the time and mentorship required to become great (investing in people).",nil
1965,"The best part of working at Google has always been the people and the culture. I get to work with very smart, hard-working, and dependable people. My teammates are great. The part of my management chain I know and talk to are good at setting technical direction and treat their people with kindness. I also am fortunate to work on fun technical challenges (this isn't the case in all of Google)","The recent layoffs were handled very poorly. Performance played almost no factor, meaning that we are left feeling like it doesn't matter how productive we are or how good we are at collaborating and helping others. The recent news that Cloud is doing hot-desking and desk sharing seems absurd for a company as wealthy as Google and which depends so heavily on its employees. The announcement presentation of Bard was a debacle; how do we not make sure we have a backup phone for a demo like that? It was disheartening to see from the level of employees ""on the ground"", where we work very hard to have redundancy for important things and do our jobs as well as we can.",nil
1966,"Benefits and comp are great, people are typically intelligent and dynamic","Google likes to think it's still a fast moving tech company, but in reality it is political and bloated. The net effect of that is that it has all of the worst of both worlds: working at a start up (custom tools, lack of process, lack of testing) and working at a huge company (bureaucracy). The worst part of Google, though, is the way that it ""motivates"" employees. The Perf system encourages individual contributions to the point that its hard to be efficient and collaborate. Everyone is doing things just to put it on their Perf. Work life balance is also a joke, no matter how many wellness bonuses they give us. Even though you technically don't need to kill yourself, they use promo to push you to work ridiculous hours. If you're not looking to get promoted (anytime soon), leadership doesn't know how to motivate you otherwise. People who push back on only working 100% of the time are seen as ""not a team player"". Don't be fooled - free lunches, remote work setups, and massages are just ways to keep you overworking.",nil
1967,"Benefits, which may be the first thing to go once reality catches up with Google.","Where to start, I'm so wildly disappointed by what Google has become and seems hell bent on preserving. Leaders: we do not have real leaders, we have people who in the earliest and least experienced parts of their career were lucky enough to land at Google and never left. Our CEO is not a business leader by training. Our CMO has had her job for over 20 years (red flag). Our CPO is MIA because we operate in such silos. Career: Join Google if you want to be severely under-leveled, have your experience minimized, be patronizingly led by people less qualified and less experienced than you, and have near zero prospects for upward mobility. Future: This company has no strategy. All you have to do is follow the news to see Google as a company woefully out of touch with the rest of the world. We have no clue how to do marketing, which is obvious from Bard to the graveyard of things we've killed off. I do not believe the future is bright given current leadership, and see a change unlikely until stuff hits the fans.",nil
1968,#NAME?,"Role-specific: - Very bureaucratic + lots of red tape when it comes to hiring. As a result, hiring process takes minimum 3 months (usually closer to 4/5 months) for a req to close and the recruiter really can't control this timing much. This makes it hard to keep candidates happy and difficult to meet quarterly goals since making each hire often takes longer than a quarter. - Some hiring managers can be tough to work or exhibit an elitist attitude; hard to convince some to follow inclusive hiring steps since they will have such a clear idea of the ""type"" of candidate they want. In general: - You really are just a number while working at Google. It's possible to build strong relationships and not feel this during the day to day, but leadership makes it clear. Examples: Lay off method was cold and not based on employee impact or performance. Leadership will remove benefits without warning, such as being able to work remotely. - Upward and internal mobility is extremely difficult. Promos take years and applying for internal roles is very competitive, so make sure you're prepared to stay in the role you're hired into for 3-4 years before even being looked at for mobility.",nil
1969,"Wide range of products to work on, good food, good benefits, good co-workers and great offices that are mostly empty.","The CEO Sundar Pichai is far out of his depth and his hand picked cloud leadership is incompetent. Yet still executives are being hired at an incredible rate. These executives are unfortunately not skilled enough to set direction at the company, or they are unable to set a sane user focused direction (See Meet, Meet and Meet Legacy). To gain past level 5 you have to find unfunded work out side of your org and hope that it gets you promoted instead of laid off. Work events and team building events inside and outside of Google have been shutdown for almost 3 years now with no sight of them coming back. Over half of the people in the company have been hired during this time, meaning that the industry leading company culture is long dead with no sign of return. From a technical side Google avoids new technology and holds onto outdated technology. This means to be competitive externally you have to spend your free time to learn all of the new technology that Google doesn't use.",nil
1970,"Great company culture and work life balance. Compensation is off the charts good. The people treat you like a human being and expect you to contribute to growth and company goals through your mind. Not what you can or cannot produce. It's not for everyone, but the company is wildly progressive.","In my experience, managers are ""hands off."" Doesn't mean they won't help or develop you but they are not in your face. This is a pro to me but some people need that to thrive. This leads to people feeling like they're not contributing or left not knowing where they stand. Layoffs. Maybe this is just part of the tech industry, but it's the worst thing that can happen, and it did to me. This can leave you feeling like a number, like you don't matter. But, I knew this going in, so it does hurt and it is scary, but I now have it on my resume and I would go back in a heartbeat.",nil

1972,Loved the role in Ann Arbor and how useful all the training was for learning the ins and outs of Google Ads through SMB account management Aside from that: - Great benefits - Great pay - Lot's of room for growth - Great people,"Only con is that the culture at Google is a bit judgmental and sensitive if you're not like 95% of the people who work there .. they say you should bring your full self to work. But... that really only applies if you're political views lean heavily towards the left (democrat/liberal). While I'm actually very liberal, fiscally I lean more republican. However, if you talk about your views on current events and mention anything related to Republican, many people automatically assume you're a bigot and this can really influence how you move up in the company (relationships matter most). Beyond that, the culture if just a bit too politically correct and in a bubble.",nil

You'll be surrounded mostly by people who are happy and passionate about their role.,"The company is hitting a lot of growing pains with trying to overly formalize certain procedures making it incredibly bureaucratic and hard to get things done. What's making it all worse is that Google has begun hiring so many senior leads from other companies who have a toxic, bullying working style.

1980,"I honestly loved my time at Google although it came to an abrupt end when they laid off 12,000 people including me. They mainly fired sourcers and recruiters and a few other teams mixed in. My team culture was great. However, you can find a lot of people at the higher levels who are on narcissistic power trips. They'll pay you great while you're here. But if you're not a L5+ person in Recruiting, then you're about as expendable as they come.","It's a huge company and there is a LOT of bureaucracy. You have to do more work than is necessary to get people hired. There are about 10 steps it takes and around 2 - 3 months to get anyone hired. They say this is to 'mitigate bias' but at the end of the day, the hiring committee just ends up making a biased hiring decision anyway.

If you create a side project that benefits thousands of people internally or saves the company money or fixes longstanding bugs you get a gentle pat on the back and zero credit at performance review time. I was laid off without warning. People still at the company will join me for lunch, but are so afraid of being fired that they won't even sign me in to let me pick my things up from my desk.

1987,"People were impressed when I said I worked at Google - my mom told me she was proud me (LOL - I'm in my 50s). Office benefits were great at the time (before the 'rona) . Our office was a smaller office but breakfast and lunch were provided as were drinks and snacks. We also had 'mental health days' and some groups and 'no meeting weeks'. The no meeting weeks were stupid to be honest. Some office has a masseuse that you could schedule. Getting meetings with senior exec was easy, people are interested in what Google has to say or is doing. I never has such and easy time getting to senior staff. Google Cloud is impressive and is just a secure & robust (if not more so) as any other cloud. Google is also a cash printing machine so while I was there it there wasn't any cost cutting or anything like that. I really came to appreciate Google tools & productivity suite - they really work well. Salary & Benefits are very good, stock options were phenomenal.",The cons are a few but notable. First I would say that there was a big cultural transformation when I joined. Google was hiring a lot of enterprise sales & business leaders and many of the existing Googlers were vocally uncomfortable with it. Their bubble was being burst. Also Google had what I describe as a naive arrogance to itself. The attitude was 'our cloud is so good you'd be foolish not to use it and consume resources the way we think you should'. This lead to being several years behind AWS & Azure in the public sector market. I could go into great detail but suffice to say that Google is not the center of the cloud universe. This lead to being years behind AWS and sales were almost non-existant while I was there. Most of the people that joined when I did have moved on. At the time the comp plan only paid us on committed spend contracts which was an extra step in adoption and difficult to negotiate. Google tries to insert itself into national political discussion but comes off as hypocritical - probably best to avoid.,nil

1994,Google is like a CrossFit gym. You come in from whatever walk of life you come from and you come out skilled in areas you didn’t expect. It’s a cool please to work but it is not an easy to place to work. Work is involved from the time you apply until you move onto another company. Working here is cool because you are surrounded by really smart people that can be incredibly helpful. There are Endless opportunities to learn as much as you want about a large variety of topics across multiple fields The in-office experience is like a college campus experience. Studious. Fun. Relaxing. Aesthetically pleasing flexible work options that can benefit all types of employees,Being in a space where everyone is smart and use to working tirelessly puts a lot of pressure on people.

1995,You have incredible autonomy to make your own schedule and your own day,"Culture. This may come as a shock but Googles internal culture to me was, odd. It was an agency dressed in a costume of “Googliness, empathy, caring etc”. The culture was a culture of walking on egg shells. If you said something wrong in the eyes of todays cancel culture, you would be ostracized. If you didn’t fit the mold, you’d be ostracized. Overall the development of talent was non existent. The training structures were outdated, and the middle management had too many team members to give any help to upskilling new hires. To the point that most would just slip through the cracks. It is a company that I believe changed, and got too political too quickly in the last few years. I can’t tell you how often I was told “this isn’t the Google that it used to be”.",nil

The reaction of top search leadership was essentially - well not according to our metrics. we'll keep on building search how we see fit. Then, chatgpt comes along and installed a new narrative - that it could do things better than Google.

Unfortunately, most people who paid the price for these bad decisions aren't the ones who made them.

* The work is generally challenging - solving difficult problems at scale - but not super intense. Rarely have to work longer than 40 hours/week if you are good at setting your expectations. 

* Anyone who has been there since the mid 2010s or longer is likely to be a super smart, super kind person who is competent and a pleasure to work with.","* It increasingly feels like other big tech companies. The bottom-up, dev-focused mentality still exists to some extent, but bureaucracy, mandates, and managerial office politics are all getting more prevalent. Leadership decisions are increasingly opaque and crassly unconcerned with employee opinions.

- Lots of meetings
- Ever-changing requirements
- Tremendous amounts of red tape needed to make any changes
- An insanely complicated codebase that is full of dead code, outdated dependencies, poorly-documented features, etc.
- It's so difficult to find points-of-contact for dependencies that it's encouraged to just ""shoot first and ask questions later,"" with the result that the ecosystem gets even more fragmented
- Juggling timezones to connect with overseas teams

While this might merit a ""meets expectations"" at other big corporations, Google so prides itself on its reputation for being innovative, scrappy, etc., that the reality is a tremendous disappointment.

Plus, at least at other corporations you can usually use familiar technologies like VSCode, Git, GitHub, Jira, etc. At Google, you use its own proprietary software for literally everything, which is a major barrier to onramping (and, I imagine, also when people leave Google to start at other firms).

As for the famous Google offices and perks — while they are no doubt nice offices, they're still just offices. You go there to work, and then go home. It's not earth-shattering.

Being on campus is like being in some weird, sanitized bubble that's disconnected from reality: go to the top floor of one of the ivory-towered Google Cloud buildings, look across the 101, and you can see massive neighborhoods of mobile homes.
