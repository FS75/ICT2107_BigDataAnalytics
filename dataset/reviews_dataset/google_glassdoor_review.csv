1,"1) Food, food, food.  15+ cafes on main campus (MTV) alone.  Mini-kitchens, snacks, drinks, free breakfast/lunch/dinner, all day, errr'day.

2) Benefits/perks.  Free 24:7 gym access (on MTV campus).  Free (self service) laundry (washer/dryer) available.  Bowling alley.  Volley ball pit.  Custom-built and exclusive employee use only outdoor sport park (MTV).  Free health/fitness assessments.  Dog-friendly.  Etc. etc. etc.

3) Compensation.  In ~2010 or 2011, Google updated its compensation packages so that they were more competitive.  

4) For the size of the organization (30K+), it has remained relatively innovative, nimble, and fast-paced and open with communication but, that is definitely changing (for the worse).

5) With so many departments, focus areas, and products, *in theory*, you should have plenty of opportunity to grow your career (horizontally or vertically).  In practice, not true.  

6)  You get to work with some of the brightest, most innovative and hard-working/diligent minds in the industry.  There's a ""con"" to that, too (see below).","1) Work/life balance.  What balance?  All those perks and benefits are an illusion.  They keep you at work and they help you to be more productive.  I've never met anybody at Google who actually time off on weekends or on vacations.  You may not hear management say, ""You have to work on weekends/vacations"" but, they set the culture by doing so - and it inevitably trickles down.  I don't know if Google inadvertently hires the work-a-holics or if they create work-a-holics in us.  Regardless, I have seen way too many of the following: marriages fall apart, colleagues choosing work and projects over family, colleagues getting physically sick and ill because of stress, colleagues crying while at work because of the stress, colleagues shooting out emails at midnight, 1am, 2am, 3am.  It is absolutely ridiculous and something needs to change.

2) Poor management.  I think the issue is that, a majority of people love Google because they get to work on interesting technical problems - and these are the people that see little value in learning how to develop emotional intelligence.  Perhaps they enjoy technical problems because people are too ""difficult.""  People are promoted into management positions - not because they actually know how to lead/manage, but because they happen to be smart or because there is no other path to grow into.  So there is a layer of intelligent individuals who are horrible managers and leaders.  Yet, there is no value system to actually do anything about that because ""emotional intelligence"" or ""adaptive leadership"" are not taken seriously.

3) Jerks.  Sure, there are a lot of brilliant people - but, sadly, there are also a lot of jerks (and, many times, they are one and the same).  Years ago, that wasn't the case.  I don't know if the pool of candidates is getting smaller, or maybe all the folks with great personalities cashed out and left, or maybe people are getting burned out and it's wearing on their personality and patience.  I've heard stories of managers straight-up cussing out their employees and intimidating/scaring their employees into compliance.

4) It's a giant company now and, inevitably, it has become slower moving and is now layered with process and bureaucracy.  So many political battles, empire building, territory grabbing.  Google says, ""Don't be evil.""  But, that practice doesn't seem to be put into place when it comes to internal practices.  :(",4.0
2,"* If you're a software engineer, you're among the kings of the hill at Google. It's an engineer-driven company without a doubt (that *is* changing, but it's still very engineer-focused).
* The perks are amazing. Yes, free breakfast, lunch, an dinner every weekday. Aaaaaamazing holiday parties (at Waldorf Astoria, NY Public Library, MoMA, etc.); overnight ski trips to Vermont; overnight nature trips to the Poconos in the summer; summer picnics at Chelsea piers; and on and on and on. I don't see this going away unless the company starts hurting financially.
* Speaking of which, the company is doing quite well, which reflects in bonuses and equity grants.
* There a huge diversity of work ranging from defending independent journalism worldwide (Google Project Shield) to crisis response during disasters (see Maps during Hurricane Sandy or Tsunamis), to the best machine learning experts and projects in the world, to more mundane revenue-driving projects in advertising, there's really something for everybody.
* It's easy to move around within the company as long as you're in good standing (the vast majority of engineers are).
* The company is amazingly open: every week Larry Page and Sergey Brin host what's called TGIF where food, beer, wine, etc. is served, a new project is presented, and afterward there's an open forum to ask the executives anything you want. It's truly fair game to ask anything, no matter how controversial, and frequently the executives will be responsive.
* No, nobody cares if you use an iPhone, Facebook, shop with Amazon, stream using Spotify, or refuse to use Google+. The company is amazingly open and flexible.

Neither pro nor con, but general information on work-life balance, promotions, and advancement.
* Work life balance can be what you want it to be on most teams. (Some teams are in more competitive sectors and require more crazy hours all the time - but very few of them). If you do what's expected, you'll be fine at least for a handful of years. Working a roughly 40 hour work week is possible, and many people do it. There are also people who are hyper-motived and work like crazy just because they love it, or because they're competitive, or they want to get a promotion. If you work 40 hour weeks without putting in anything extra, you'll fall behind them as they advance and you stand still - and maybe that doesn't matter, so it works out for everybody. But at least know where you would realistically stand.
* If you excel and work your butt off, you'll be compensated and promoted. If you let yourself be a code monkey, and just sit coding with your head down all day, you'll be fine but won't advance. A big complaint from some Googlers is about not being able to advance ""even at Google"" with pure coding. Sure, if you're the uber genius who created MapReduce and Bigtable, you're going to advance like a rocket without having to do anything but coding; but if you're like most engineers at Google -- smarter than average, but just average compared to other Googlers -- you're just a good coder and not revolutionary. Code monkeys are important to actually get stuff done, and to be sure you absolutely need to be a good coder as a software engineer (it's the minimum requirement), but code monkeys won't advance because they're not leaders and they're easy to replace. To get promoted you need to lead and do more than just code. There are plenty of ways to lead other than being an official tech lead, so this isn't actually _that_ hard, so the real point is just that you can't just sit there coding what other people tell you to code all day and expect to advance.","* It *is* becoming larger, and with it comes growing pains: bureaucracy, slow to respond to market threats, bloated teams, cross-divisional tension (though nothing remotely approaching that of Microsoft's internal tension).
* The quality of the engineers is possibly dropping, but possibly not. It's hard to get real metrics, because as the absolute number of people grows, naturally the number of bad apples grows; as a percentage it's supposedly the same as it ever was, but with larger numbers of poorer quality engineers it just _feels_ like things might be changing for the worse.
* Also with growth means more internal-confidential data leaks (again, because of the raw numbers of people) -- product announcements being ruined, etc. That means the company has to be tighter-lipped internally to avoid leaks, which makes things less open. It's still an amazingly open place, but less so than it was even a couple years ago. The good thing is they recognize it and actively look to improve things because they know how important it is to keep the good culture.",5.0
3,"You can't find a more well-regarded company that actually deserves the hype it gets.

You'll work on cutting edge projects / solve important issues that impact your community and the world

You'll meet interesting people who are your colleagues, managers, and senior management.

You'll open the paper and see your company in the news almost every day, and read about projects you're working on, which is a cool thing

You'll see Larry and Sergey at TGIF and you'll admire how they lead the company. They are brilliant, goofy, low key but intense, and likeable. 

There are 22 cafes (more or less), the food is excellent, and it's free.

Your pay will typically be competitive, though it needs to be tweaked up a bit since the economy has improved.

Google cares about how it treats its employees.

The campus is like an academic campus in many ways.

There are tons of activities on campus, like authors speaking about their books, films after work, and gyms where you can work out - but you'll need to make sure to carve out time to do these things.

You'll get plenty of external validation from people who suddenly think you're smart and rich because you work there, even if you're not rich and you're as smart when you didn't work at Google.

If and when you leave, you'll never regret having that company on your resume. It opens doors. 

The company is flexible - if you're lucky, you won't have a micromanager boss and you can be somewhat flexible in how you work - but don't get me wrong - you'll work a LOT. But you don't have to do all of it chained to your desk.","I live in SF so the commute can take between 1.5 hours to 1.75 hours each way on the shuttle - sometimes 2 hours each way on a busy day or rainy day. That means being on the bus for 3-4 hours PER DAY. It's a wired bus though which means you can work on the way to Mountain View. But it can feel brutal.

Your first year or two are really important in terms of your career at Google and they affect how you're viewed, and your ability to be promoted. You should always ask to work on high profile projects. If you don't get them, don't expect to get high ratings or get promoted. Always volunteer for cross functional group work for maximum exposure, and then work hard at those things.

You'll likely work on something that no one will explain to you and it will take you at least a year to be comfortable doing what you're working on, even if you're super quick at learning.  No one has time to train you or teach you what you're doing - which is kind of hard.

After two or three years, people you started out with at Google start to get promoted. If you're not one of them, you'll wonder why and how it happened, and that process is somewhat political and not always clear. 

It's a big company now. And super political. So don't be naive. Expect some people to be catty, some people to be territorial, and be prepared to be mentally tough. Don't let people see your vulnerableness. It's a Darwinistic culture with a huge dose of 30-something idealism on top which can fool you into thinking that people are easygoing - they're not. They're driven. If you're not driven, you're not going to fit in.

When you start at Google, it seems like peer reviews are super important - they are, but they are the sprinkles on the fro yo. The important thing is that your direct manager knows your work, likes your work and likes you, and then you can get promoted. If your boss doesn't like you, all the positive peer reviews in the world won't help you.  Make sure you know what your boss wants, and give it to them. You will have weekly one on ones, and make sure you are addressing your performance at each one, asking if they have questions, how you can improve, can you work on cross functional projects, etc.

It's really hard to find work life balance at Google. The workload is huge.   I hardly have time to work out. The commute is brutal. My family sometimes needs more from me and I can't give it. I'm still trying to find the balance. I think I need more down time than most people so I have a hard time being structured every day to fit all the things I want into my day, so a lot of things slip, like working out.",5.0
4,"I've been at Google a long time, so the financial benefits still outweigh any cons. The people I work with are still mostly great, especially most of my management chain (though one or two are no-ops).","The company was founded on psychological safety, don't be evil, hire smart creatives, etc.. Today, the company has grown so fast and so large that now the majority of people seem to be typical tech industry employees. That means most of the management has now come from outside the company, so that has killed the culture. Psychological safety is gone, especially after the way the layoffs were handled. I miss Laszlo Bock; he knew how to treat the workforce. I miss Larry, Sergey, and Eric. The general quality of my peers has gone down. Not as people, they're all lovely, but as practitioners. Most of them do what we'd have considered low-quality work 5 years ago. It's shockingly bad, really, by comparison. They've all been hired so fast and in such an environment where they weren't properly trained or didn't have the proper background to begin with or haven't been given the time and mentorship required to become great (investing in people).",3.0
5,"The best part of working at Google has always been the people and the culture. I get to work with very smart, hard-working, and dependable people. My teammates are great. The part of my management chain I know and talk to are good at setting technical direction and treat their people with kindness. I also am fortunate to work on fun technical challenges (this isn't the case in all of Google)","The recent layoffs were handled very poorly. Performance played almost no factor, meaning that we are left feeling like it doesn't matter how productive we are or how good we are at collaborating and helping others. The recent news that Cloud is doing hot-desking and desk sharing seems absurd for a company as wealthy as Google and which depends so heavily on its employees. The announcement presentation of Bard was a debacle; how do we not make sure we have a backup phone for a demo like that? It was disheartening to see from the level of employees ""on the ground"", where we work very hard to have redundancy for important things and do our jobs as well as we can.",4.0
6,"Benefits and comp are great, people are typically intelligent and dynamic","Google likes to think it's still a fast moving tech company, but in reality it is political and bloated. The net effect of that is that it has all of the worst of both worlds: working at a start up (custom tools, lack of process, lack of testing) and working at a huge company (bureaucracy). The worst part of Google, though, is the way that it ""motivates"" employees. The Perf system encourages individual contributions to the point that its hard to be efficient and collaborate. Everyone is doing things just to put it on their Perf. Work life balance is also a joke, no matter how many wellness bonuses they give us. Even though you technically don't need to kill yourself, they use promo to push you to work ridiculous hours. If you're not looking to get promoted (anytime soon), leadership doesn't know how to motivate you otherwise. People who push back on only working 100% of the time are seen as ""not a team player"". Don't be fooled - free lunches, remote work setups, and massages are just ways to keep you overworking.",1.0
7,"Benefits, which may be the first thing to go once reality catches up with Google.","Where to start, I'm so wildly disappointed by what Google has become and seems hell bent on preserving. Leaders: we do not have real leaders, we have people who in the earliest and least experienced parts of their career were lucky enough to land at Google and never left. Our CEO is not a business leader by training. Our CMO has had her job for over 20 years (red flag). Our CPO is MIA because we operate in such silos. Career: Join Google if you want to be severely under-leveled, have your experience minimized, be patronizingly led by people less qualified and less experienced than you, and have near zero prospects for upward mobility. Future: This company has no strategy. All you have to do is follow the news to see Google as a company woefully out of touch with the rest of the world. We have no clue how to do marketing, which is obvious from Bard to the graveyard of things we've killed off. I do not believe the future is bright given current leadership, and see a change unlikely until stuff hits the fans.",1.0
8,"- Having a good experience at Google depends largely on your team and I had a great team that I was sad to leave. - Good severance when laid off - Amazing benefits while employed, would have made it difficult to leave the company by choice despite being unhappy with a lot of aspects of the work","Role-specific: - Very bureaucratic + lots of red tape when it comes to hiring. As a result, hiring process takes minimum 3 months (usually closer to 4/5 months) for a req to close and the recruiter really can't control this timing much. This makes it hard to keep candidates happy and difficult to meet quarterly goals since making each hire often takes longer than a quarter. - Some hiring managers can be tough to work or exhibit an elitist attitude; hard to convince some to follow inclusive hiring steps since they will have such a clear idea of the ""type"" of candidate they want. In general: - You really are just a number while working at Google. It's possible to build strong relationships and not feel this during the day to day, but leadership makes it clear. Examples: Lay off method was cold and not based on employee impact or performance. Leadership will remove benefits without warning, such as being able to work remotely. - Upward and internal mobility is extremely difficult. Promos take years and applying for internal roles is very competitive, so make sure you're prepared to stay in the role you're hired into for 3-4 years before even being looked at for mobility.",3.0

10,"Wide range of products to work on, good food, good benefits, good co-workers and great offices that are mostly empty.","The CEO Sundar Pichai is far out of his depth and his hand picked cloud leadership is incompetent. Yet still executives are being hired at an incredible rate. These executives are unfortunately not skilled enough to set direction at the company, or they are unable to set a sane user focused direction (See Meet, Meet and Meet Legacy). To gain past level 5 you have to find unfunded work out side of your org and hope that it gets you promoted instead of laid off. Work events and team building events inside and outside of Google have been shutdown for almost 3 years now with no sight of them coming back. Over half of the people in the company have been hired during this time, meaning that the industry leading company culture is long dead with no sign of return. From a technical side Google avoids new technology and holds onto outdated technology. This means to be competitive externally you have to spend your free time to learn all of the new technology that Google doesn't use.",2.0
11,"Great company culture and work life balance. Compensation is off the charts good. The people treat you like a human being and expect you to contribute to growth and company goals through your mind. Not what you can or cannot produce. It's not for everyone, but the company is wildly progressive.","In my experience, managers are ""hands off."" Doesn't mean they won't help or develop you but they are not in your face. This is a pro to me but some people need that to thrive. This leads to people feeling like they're not contributing or left not knowing where they stand. Layoffs. Maybe this is just part of the tech industry, but it's the worst thing that can happen, and it did to me. This can leave you feeling like a number, like you don't matter. But, I knew this going in, so it does hurt and it is scary, but I now have it on my resume and I would go back in a heartbeat.",5.0

21,Google is like a CrossFit gym. You come in from whatever walk of life you come from and you come out skilled in areas you didn’t expect. It’s a cool please to work but it is not an easy to place to work. Work is involved from the time you apply until you move onto another company. Working here is cool because you are surrounded by really smart people that can be incredibly helpful. There are Endless opportunities to learn as much as you want about a large variety of topics across multiple fields The in-office experience is like a college campus experience. Studious. Fun. Relaxing. Aesthetically pleasing flexible work options that can benefit all types of employees,Being in a space where everyone is smart and use to working tirelessly puts a lot of pressure on people.

22,You have incredible autonomy to make your own schedule and your own day,"Culture. This may come as a shock but Googles internal culture to me was, odd. It was an agency dressed in a costume of “Googliness, empathy, caring etc”. The culture was a culture of walking on egg shells. If you said something wrong in the eyes of todays cancel culture, you would be ostracized. If you didn’t fit the mold, you’d be ostracized. Overall the development of talent was non existent. The training structures were outdated, and the middle management had too many team members to give any help to upskilling new hires. To the point that most would just slip through the cracks. It is a company that I believe changed, and got too political too quickly in the last few years. I can’t tell you how often I was told “this isn’t the Google that it used to be”.",2.0

26,"People were impressed when I said I worked at Google - my mom told me she was proud me (LOL - I'm in my 50s). Office benefits were great at the time (before the 'rona) . Our office was a smaller office but breakfast and lunch were provided as were drinks and snacks. We also had 'mental health days' and some groups and 'no meeting weeks'. The no meeting weeks were stupid to be honest. Some office has a masseuse that you could schedule. Getting meetings with senior exec was easy, people are interested in what Google has to say or is doing. I never has such and easy time getting to senior staff. Google Cloud is impressive and is just a secure & robust (if not more so) as any other cloud. Google is also a cash printing machine so while I was there it there wasn't any cost cutting or anything like that. I really came to appreciate Google tools & productivity suite - they really work well. Salary & Benefits are very good, stock options were phenomenal.",The cons are a few but notable. First I would say that there was a big cultural transformation when I joined. Google was hiring a lot of enterprise sales & business leaders and many of the existing Googlers were vocally uncomfortable with it. Their bubble was being burst. Also Google had what I describe as a naive arrogance to itself. The attitude was 'our cloud is so good you'd be foolish not to use it and consume resources the way we think you should'. This lead to being several years behind AWS & Azure in the public sector market. I could go into great detail but suffice to say that Google is not the center of the cloud universe. This lead to being years behind AWS and sales were almost non-existant while I was there. Most of the people that joined when I did have moved on. At the time the comp plan only paid us on committed spend contracts which was an extra step in adoption and difficult to negotiate. Google tries to insert itself into national political discussion but comes off as hypocritical - probably best to avoid.,4.0

47,Google is like a CrossFit gym. You come in from whatever walk of life you come from and you come out skilled in areas you didn’t expect. It’s a cool please to work but it is not an easy to place to work. Work is involved from the time you apply until you move onto another company. Working here is cool because you are surrounded by really smart people that can be incredibly helpful. There are Endless opportunities to learn as much as you want about a large variety of topics across multiple fields The in-office experience is like a college campus experience. Studious. Fun. Relaxing. Aesthetically pleasing flexible work options that can benefit all types of employees,Being in a space where everyone is smart and use to working tirelessly puts a lot of pressure on people.

49,You have incredible autonomy to make your own schedule and your own day,"Culture. This may come as a shock but Googles internal culture to me was, odd. It was an agency dressed in a costume of “Googliness, empathy, caring etc”. The culture was a culture of walking on egg shells. If you said something wrong in the eyes of todays cancel culture, you would be ostracized. If you didn’t fit the mold, you’d be ostracized. Overall the development of talent was non existent. The training structures were outdated, and the middle management had too many team members to give any help to upskilling new hires. To the point that most would just slip through the cracks. It is a company that I believe changed, and got too political too quickly in the last few years. I can’t tell you how often I was told “this isn’t the Google that it used to be”.",2.0

53,"People were impressed when I said I worked at Google - my mom told me she was proud me (LOL - I'm in my 50s). Office benefits were great at the time (before the 'rona) . Our office was a smaller office but breakfast and lunch were provided as were drinks and snacks. We also had 'mental health days' and some groups and 'no meeting weeks'. The no meeting weeks were stupid to be honest. Some office has a masseuse that you could schedule. Getting meetings with senior exec was easy, people are interested in what Google has to say or is doing. I never has such and easy time getting to senior staff. Google Cloud is impressive and is just a secure & robust (if not more so) as any other cloud. Google is also a cash printing machine so while I was there it there wasn't any cost cutting or anything like that. I really came to appreciate Google tools & productivity suite - they really work well. Salary & Benefits are very good, stock options were phenomenal.",The cons are a few but notable. First I would say that there was a big cultural transformation when I joined. Google was hiring a lot of enterprise sales & business leaders and many of the existing Googlers were vocally uncomfortable with it. Their bubble was being burst. Also Google had what I describe as a naive arrogance to itself. The attitude was 'our cloud is so good you'd be foolish not to use it and consume resources the way we think you should'. This lead to being several years behind AWS & Azure in the public sector market. I could go into great detail but suffice to say that Google is not the center of the cloud universe. This lead to being years behind AWS and sales were almost non-existant while I was there. Most of the people that joined when I did have moved on. At the time the comp plan only paid us on committed spend contracts which was an extra step in adoption and difficult to negotiate. Google tries to insert itself into national political discussion but comes off as hypocritical - probably best to avoid.,4.0

116,"* Pay around the top of what you can get in big tech.

* Google still has most of the perks it's famous for. Solid food, entertainment options, gyms, interesting shared spaces. 

* The work is generally challenging - solving difficult problems at scale - but not super intense. Rarely have to work longer than 40 hours/week if you are good at setting your expectations. 

* Anyone who has been there since the mid 2010s or longer is likely to be a super smart, super kind person who is competent and a pleasure to work with.","* It increasingly feels like other big tech companies. The bottom-up, dev-focused mentality still exists to some extent, but bureaucracy, mandates, and managerial office politics are all getting more prevalent. Leadership decisions are increasingly opaque and crassly unconcerned with employee opinions. 

* Hiring standards have plummeted with the rapid expansion starting in the late 2010s. Combined with the widely available materials and coaching for passing Google interviews, this has led to a lot more incompetent people getting into the company at all levels. 

* The company is agonizingly slow to fire people for performance reasons. This means if you have teammates, reports, or (the worse) managers who are incompetent, they could linger in their positions for a year or years being minimally productive -  or even actively counterproductive - before they are let go. 

* You'd often think the company was struggling to make ends meet, rather than profiting tens of billions of dollars per year. Perks are being suspended or cut, mass layoffs occurred without warning, and the already haphazard hiring pipeline has been frozen on and off. Upper management maintains that this is all the result of economic headwinds and long term strategy, versus propping up the wealth of the major shareholders.",4.0

212,"* Pay around the top of what you can get in big tech.

* Google still has most of the perks it's famous for. Solid food, entertainment options, gyms, interesting shared spaces. 

* The work is generally challenging - solving difficult problems at scale - but not super intense. Rarely have to work longer than 40 hours/week if you are good at setting your expectations. 

* Anyone who has been there since the mid 2010s or longer is likely to be a super smart, super kind person who is competent and a pleasure to work with.","* It increasingly feels like other big tech companies. The bottom-up, dev-focused mentality still exists to some extent, but bureaucracy, mandates, and managerial office politics are all getting more prevalent. Leadership decisions are increasingly opaque and crassly unconcerned with employee opinions. 

* Hiring standards have plummeted with the rapid expansion starting in the late 2010s. Combined with the widely available materials and coaching for passing Google interviews, this has led to a lot more incompetent people getting into the company at all levels. 

* The company is agonizingly slow to fire people for performance reasons. This means if you have teammates, reports, or (the worse) managers who are incompetent, they could linger in their positions for a year or years being minimally productive -  or even actively counterproductive - before they are let go. 

* You'd often think the company was struggling to make ends meet, rather than profiting tens of billions of dollars per year. Perks are being suspended or cut, mass layoffs occurred without warning, and the already haphazard hiring pipeline has been frozen on and off. Upper management maintains that this is all the result of economic headwinds and long term strategy, versus propping up the wealth of the major shareholders.",4.0

462,"- Great pay/benefits
- Pretty offices with nice perks
- Smart and helpful coworkers
- Work/life balance has so far been pretty good","The actual day-to-day is what you would expect as an engineer at any large corporation:

- Lots of meetings
- Ever-changing requirements
- Tremendous amounts of red tape needed to make any changes
- An insanely complicated codebase that is full of dead code, outdated dependencies, poorly-documented features, etc.
- It's so difficult to find points-of-contact for dependencies that it's encouraged to just ""shoot first and ask questions later,"" with the result that the ecosystem gets even more fragmented
- Juggling timezones to connect with overseas teams

While this might merit a ""meets expectations"" at other big corporations, Google so prides itself on its reputation for being innovative, scrappy, etc., that the reality is a tremendous disappointment.

Plus, at least at other corporations you can usually use familiar technologies like VSCode, Git, GitHub, Jira, etc. At Google, you use its own proprietary software for literally everything, which is a major barrier to onramping (and, I imagine, also when people leave Google to start at other firms).

As for the famous Google offices and perks — while they are no doubt nice offices, they're still just offices. You go there to work, and then go home. It's not earth-shattering.

Being on campus is like being in some weird, sanitized bubble that's disconnected from reality: go to the top floor of one of the ivory-towered Google Cloud buildings, look across the 101, and you can see massive neighborhoods of mobile homes.

471,"I recently had the opportunity to work at Google and it was an incredible experience. The company culture is truly unique and fosters a sense of collaboration and innovation. The work environment is fast-paced and challenging, but also incredibly rewarding. One of the things that stood out to me during my time at Google was the level of expertise and knowledge of my colleagues. I had the opportunity to work with some of the brightest minds in the industry and it was truly inspiring. The mentorship and guidance provided by my team leaders helped me to grow both personally and professionally. The company is also very forward-thinking when it comes to technology and is always pushing the boundaries of what is possible. It was exciting to be a part of such a dynamic and innovative organization. In terms of work-life balance, Google does a great job of promoting a healthy balance. The company encourages employees to take the time they need to recharge and focus on their well-being. Overall, my experience at Google was extremely positive and I feel grateful for the opportunity to have been a part of such an incredible organization. I highly recommend the company to anyone looking for a challenging, rewarding, and innovative work experience.","It is worth noting that working at Google can also have its downsides. The company is known for its fast-paced and high-pressure environment, which can be stressful at times. Additionally, the company's size and bureaucracy can make it difficult to navigate and get things done. It may also be difficult to get noticed or promoted within the company due to the sheer number of employees and the high level of competition. Another con could be the cost of living in the area where the office is located, it could be very high, which can be a challenge for some employees. It is also worth noting that the company's policies and practices have come under scrutiny in recent years, particularly in regards to issues such as privacy and censorship. While Google is committed to making positive changes in these areas, it is important to be aware of these issues and how they may impact your experience at the company.",4.0
