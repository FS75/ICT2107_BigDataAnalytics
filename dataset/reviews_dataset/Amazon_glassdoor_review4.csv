16,5.0,"Know your team plus what you're getting into, and you'll be fine","There are a lot of horror stories about Amazon. Honestly there seems to be truth in a lot of them, and stories about OnCall, toxic teammates and ruthless managers floating all of the internet. But for what it's worth, it's important to remember that the vocal minority will always be the loudest and most visible complainers. If you aren't unlucky and end up on a well-run and efficient team, then quite frankly I think working at Amazon is actually really nice.

I interned twice at Amazon and the team I was placed on was (and still is) quite pleasant to work with. Yes OnCall still sucks but for the most part we keep operational load low. Management chain is very understanding up several levels, and I feel very comfortable working with my teammates. It isn't ""easy"" by any means and it's definitely not possible to coast/autopilot every day like at certain other companies, but it is definitely rewarding for the effort you put into it. The pay is competitive enough, lots of room for career growth, and there are always interesting problems to tackle if you are interested in them.",There is admittedly a larger percentage of horror story teams than at other companies.

I am not that kind of person), think about RME they pay better and less people under you, 6 weeks of 6 days a week peak sucked, prime and PEAS week 5 days not horrible but annoying, no real bonus pay or shares unless promoted, Front Half shifts are great, Back half days meh (lose your Saturday), Back half nights (no weekend/not compensated for it AT ALL - my first shift/I have terrible luck but ignorance is bliss I guess), If you land BHNs just roll the dice again (get another job) or say you need an accommodation to a new shift (I was on it for a year but wanted to quit every day, too stubborn to quit I guess thank GOD I had my girlfriend with through it all).

The VP used to echo the saying “best place to work at the best place to work” but that attitude has long since disappeared. The company refuses to hire to fill gaps left by devs who have left the company. Leadership still imposes demands on dev teams with no input from them on what is needed for the product. Higher level managers have begun slowly, covertly converting my team to a devops role. On-call is ridiculous, and no matter how much dev teams plead with management no effort is exerted to change things.

Compensation increases this year were a joke, and the increase has been completely cancelled out by the depreciation of our RSUs. With inflation and depreciation my total compensation is worth substantially less than it was last year. If you try to change teams, management will do their best to prevent that from happening by giving you a poor yearly performance evaluation for arbitrary reasons.

Schedules are not that flexible and using A to Z to pick up shifts means you'll be competing with all of your coworkers for shifts/the only ones left will be the shift no one else wants to work. 
If you work hard you get noticed by managers but not in a good way. If you're always ready to grab a shift when they need coverage or volunteering to pick up/take on extra work, instead of being up for a promotion, they just expect you to be their work horse. They'll constantly message you whenever someone calls out or drops a shift to come in, and expect you to have no life outside of work. I've heard from other employees about a supervisor trying to bribe them with Uber eats to stay later during a shift or to pick up a shift. 
Revolving door of employees. Every couple months (peak season) they go through a hiring period where they overhire for your site.

Work is straightforward
Management was motivational","Co workers, sometimes when it would get very busy in ship dock, they would send people from pack or sort to help us out. It was more than a couple times on the daily that I would find myself in a hot trailer swamped with packages, stuck with a slow moving person from another department. In management eyes, there's two people in the trailer so it should be faster, in reality sometimes the second person from another department would get in the way. It was hard to keep the work balanced and fair. 


Breaks, in a 10 hour shift the management in those times gave us a 15 minute break , then a 30 min lunch break , and then another 15 minute break later. Pretty standard for warehouse, the only thing was that, the distance between the work station and break room was well around 5 minutes distance. Then you had to wait in line in the break room with at least a hundred other people to get a microwave to heat up your food.

358,3.0,Lots of unanswered questions.,People you work with. Amazon discount. Great company with similar beliefs. Peculiar ways.,1.) Feedback for every little thing. Like 1 extra space in a sentence or giving the customer an answer that was wrong but given to you by someone higher up. 2.) Not enough/ confusing training. I don't want to get trained for a specific area of seller support. It would be better if I could apply for fba or fbm because the training is rushed. I need to have the freedom to choose to see if I am already qualified or not. 3.) Not enough pay / benefits. I felt like a slave during peak season. 12 hour days Not enough time to to finish 1 call. I didn't even know about most of the benefits until my last days with the company. 4.) Too many unanswered questions. I understand that not every question will have an answer but while working for seller support the biggest frustration was not having immediate answer to questions we never expected to ask during training. To get an answer the customer will have to wait for at least 30 mins of awkward conversation and silence to try and hopefully recieve/find the right answer. Most of the time this causes anger and the inability to finish your job / case before the next person is already calling. 5.) The inability to leave if my child's school called and needed me to pick them up early. 6.) Nobody could tell me for a month if the company was going to hire me or let me go after my position expired. I was let go with one week of notice. After being recognized by the top person in my field publicly via the company social media page. 7.) Too many steps. You need 6 arms to do this job. And it's not even about typing speed. There are literally too many steps. It's confusing. Would be better if ther were an encyclopedia with answers that could accurately depict what you are asking for. It's no secret that Amazon seller support needs a major reboot. Honestly it just feels like everybody is winging it because of my reasons listed above including the people over my position.

493,3.0,"Good job, bad warehouse","1. On the job training, with a small handful of excellent trainers.
Easy to get the job as a temp/seasonal worker and then to move to permanent employee status.
2. Opportunities for advancement.
3. Consistent shift start time. Never had a shift cancelled.
4. Many opportunities for extra shifts, especially around the holidays and busy national business events.","1. ""Too many cooks."" Widespread internal inconsistencies made doing the simple, moderately physically intensive work unnecessarily confusing/difficult because individual members of management were constantly contradicting or overriding other members of management or otherwise playing office politics. Our training department was especially prone to corruption.

2. Lack of accountability for both associates and management, often leading to recurring safety issues that were not effectively addressed.

3. Lack of follow-through from management. Regular promises/agreements were made and then discarded casually or became issues when other members of management became involved, which was often. Some members would then gas-light you, and there was little recourse for targets of this degeneracy.",Associate,Current Employee,"Saint Louis, MO","Jun 28, 2022"

- Work is meaningful
- Great benefits
- Opportunities to work remote or hybrid","- As a security engineer, average salary is below value you deliver to the company. 
- Promotion process is a bit ridiculous. Ones who are good at bragging and spicing up should expect to get promoted faster. Ones who are humble or not great at their writing skills have hard time getting promoted. Most engineers tend to leave the company having spent 4-6 years at the company as they prefer to get promoted by leaving the company rather than going through the internal process.
- Promotion bar are not consistent across the company. In some teams, managers do realize the ridiculousness described above and promote fairly where as others don't.
