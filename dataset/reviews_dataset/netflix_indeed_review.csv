I enjoyed working there--culture was great, the best colleagues and worked on really hard challenging but fulfilling projects. Sadly, with the rising competition and immense growth, the culture of the company has shifted extensively. HR does little to address issues with regards to compensation and performance.

The free Netflix merch. All of your expenses are automatically paid for W/O needing approval.

I always worked from home, so I never got a gauge on the work environment. Truth be told, the ""culture"" depends on the particular team you're working on.

4.0,Stable Employment but Workload Can be A Problem,I came from a smaller production company where I performed 2 and sometimes 3 jobs for 1 pay. When I first arrived at Netflix I felt a sigh of relief. I became an expert at my 1 job and even took on some additional duties but lately it seems they are trying to pile on more duties to cut costs and keep from hiring/filling departments. They have the money to hire great talent and they should continue to do so.,,,Executive Assistant,Current Employee,"Los Angeles, CA","November 29, 2022"

1.0,Unwritten Rules,"Quality of work is in decline. There are ""no rules"", so employees can act unethically and immorally. There are a lot of ""unwritten rules"". A lot of ""Mean Girls""-like mentality. Popularity is valued more than expertise or logical reasoning and insight. Managers flat out state ""I don't care"". Onboarding was incorrect and compromised job performance. Payroll lied. Accountability is evaded. Human Resources made things worse. Executive titles and ""managing directors"" spent more time slacking defamatory gossip and non-work-related nonsense, as opposed to modeling leadership.",,,Freelancer,Former Employee,"Hollywood, CA","November 27, 2022"

3.0,High Performance Culture to Challenge You,"Netflix asks for a lot from its employees. They pay well, but it's not uncommon for your family to feel like they're the second priority. You are asked to show up fully and with vulnerability (aka seek feedback and give feedback), but the risk is you're then judged. There is not a lot of sincere compassion or curiosity from leadership for the employee experience. The sentiment is""love it or leave it"" and ""it's not for everybody."" That lack of empathy plays out even more harshly if an employee is from a historically excluded community.","High compensation, great opportunity to grow your resume, super smart colleagues to learn from",Company has become too big to care about employee experience,HR,Former Employee,"Los Angeles, CA","November 17, 2022"
1.0,1 star,"What is the best part of working at the company?

You can be let go anytime due to business needs or if you’re not one of the best productively.",,,Netflix Technology Support Specialist,Current Employee,London,"July 3, 2022"
3.0,Sometimes good sometimes bad,Always had contests to make the work environment a great place to work. I do not know if the stressful calls without much help for management is worth sticking around for the contests. Seems like there is always a shift bid going on and the available shifts change dramatically within each 3 month period. This makes it hard for people with kids. You may get a 6am to 2pm shift one time and then company will get rid of that shift all together and depending on where you are in seniority or stats yuh could end up with a 4pm to midnight shift. You just never know.,,,Team Lead,Former Employee,"Denver, CO","June 15, 2022"
3.0,Horrible Management,"Even with 9+ years of experience in my field, I was micromanaged to death! Disgusting lack of trust and inherent fear amongst teammates. Abysmal leadership.

I was also thrown onto multiple projects on my third week without any guidance.

Company benefits and pay were amazing, though. Super top notch stuff!",,,Project Manager,Former Employee,Remote,"May 30, 2022"

5.0,"Productive, Inclusive, accommodating, and overall stable workplace.","When Netflix shut down it's call center my heart broke. I finally felt like I had found a stable job with reasonable pay and benefits that I could work at forever and work my way up. I felt such pride working for this company and that was a huge deal for me. I wanted to work somewhere brag worthy, and that call center was it. I loved literally everyone I worked with. I'm not sure I'll ever feel as satisfied working any other job and I wish daily they didn't outsource all their call centers and shut us down. It's been years and I still miss that job.",,,Customer Service Rep,Former Employee,"Salt Lake City, UT","April 29, 2022"

1.0,Just terrible,"My 3 years there were the 3 worst years of my working life. It was an awful experience working with a company bloated with too many inept managers. I was ultimately let go for reading a gardening book at my desk between calls, a rule that was never written down and none of my colleagues had heard spoken. They were a bunch of no talent clowns.",,,Customer Service Associate,Former Employee,"Hillsboro, OR","March 22, 2022"
5.0,"Productive and fun place to work at, they are very respectful and everyone gets along, no drama. Excellent work ethics, my favorite job of my life!","Everything at Netflix is wonderful. Great!!

Change is good and I'm only part time now so I'm looking for a full time job and it I have been there for 7 years, it is time to explore other options.",,,Customer Service Representative,Current Employee,California,"March 21, 2022"
2.0,Tense and stressful workplace,"Judging by the questions, I’m assuming this doesn’t have to do with working on set for Netflix. All I can say is, out of the couple times I ended up working for Netflix, specifically the last time: the management was the worst out of any job I’ve ever worked. The policies were absolutely ludicrous to the point where changes had to be made urgently in the middle of the project. I wouldn’t care if they knew who wrote this.",,,Production Assistant,Former Employee,"Cleveland, OH","March 18, 2022"
4.0,Dream job while you're useful,"Disclaimer: I was laid off as part of a reorganization (1 of 10), but I would have written the same review had I been the one who was spared. In the 5+ years that I worked at NF, 4 first years were awesome. I often felt elated, I loved going to work both physically and then virtually due to COVID. Mature, caring colleagues, interesting work, lots of learning, wonderful connections. I joined when my team was in the startup phase, and it was the best time for ideas and trying new things with no budget limitations. Gradually, over the course of the following 5 years, the need to scale led to constant changes, both of leadership and workflows. Team leaders were being ""let go"" on average every 1.5 years if not sooner. There was barely enough time to become good at what one does as yet another big reorg/title change would come around. Lastly, the team came under the leadership of people who had absolutely no knowledge of the team's specialty, but were ""experts"" in strategizing and optimizing processes.
Eventually it shifted from being people-driven to process-driven, from collegial to top-down. The bottom line started winning over quality while business needs outweighed everything else.
Pros:
Awesome colleagues
Productive work environment
Top of market pay, nice perks
Lots of learning opportunities through constant change

Cons:
Low job security
Process driven vs people driven
Constant change
High level of ambiguity",,,Project Manager,Former Employee,"Los Angeles, CA","March 14, 2022"

The people were really nice and the company did not really spare any expense to strive to make a movie of a high caliber.",,,Health & Safety Monitor,Former Employee,"New Orleans, LA","February 21, 2022"
3.0,Generally a decent place but turnover is high and work appreciation is low,"I initially enjoyed working here but I noticed that sometimes you’re not appreciated for the work that you do well and, instead, you’re criticized for what you may not do well. Scheduling and calendar management are major for assistants but they’ll also throw project work on you which is what a coordinator should be doing - not an admin.",,,Administrative Assistant,Former Employee,"Los Angeles, CA","February 4, 2022"
2.0,"The over emphasis on DEI is maddening
Their entire company is modeled around 1 percent of the population","Job security is zero. Once your contract is up you need to re-apply to work on another project.
Constant emphasis on inclusion and diversity makes it feel like that is the only reason the company exist.
And if you don’t agree, of course, you are not included.",,,Artist,Current Employee,"Burbank, CA","January 29, 2022"
1.0,"Sounds great from the outside, totally different on the inside","Be ready to be worked into the dirt. There's no such thing as a work-life balance here.

Managers protect each other and act counter to the company culture, then gaslight you by saying you're misinterpreting the culture.

Politics is the only way to get ahead and be ready to be passed up for promotions or more responsibilities by those who play the game better, even if their work is terrible.",,,Engineer,Current Employee,"Los Angeles, CA","December 16, 2021"
5.0,"Yoga balls are slippery and we need more catered food with fruits and vegetables, imported and poached correctly.","I really liked working with everyone in a diverse work setting. I like family settings, food, and structurally sound sets built locally. I review this job is amazing because I live locally. My family lived in the South Shore and my Fiancée lived nearby and I never snuck away to visit for holidays due to quarantine and FMLA, mainly the CDC.",,,ON SET CoVID-19 Red Zone Cleaner,Current Employee,"Boston, MA","December 13, 2021"

4.0,"Good, but not great.","When I worked here, I was very happy! The pay was satisfying, and there were little to no cons! However, as I started overachieving at work, I never got a raise! That is why I'm giving it a 4 and not a 5.",,,Janitor,Former Employee,"Fresno, CA","November 17, 2021"
5.0,Best company,This was one of if not the best company I’ve worked for. The culture the people just the overall vibe was awesome. I definitely would recommend working here.,,,Customer Service Representative,Former Employee,"Fremont, CA","November 13, 2021"

You are amazing I’m sad you left Salt Lake! 😔,,,Customer Service Representative,Former Employee,"Salt Lake City, UT","October 28, 2021"
3.0,Good but bad,"They offered a high salary. The working environment was good, however there was a culture of fear which everyone was talking about. Seeing my mates getting fired often, I found out I'm working in a place where my space was not secured.",,,Management Trainee Intern,Former Employee,California,"September 15, 2021"
3.0,Basic Call Center,"Not a great place to work. Expectations were high, morale was low. Nearly unreachable goals and management was just the guy who sat next to you who had the best call times.",,,Customer Service Representative,Former Employee,"Hillsboro, OR","August 31, 2021"
5.0,Best place I have ever worked,"The DVD.com hub I worked at was wonderful, very few employees, very laid-back atmosphere, but highly efficient and productive, encouraging self-motivation. If you wanted to learn more positions, you could, if you were content with the same tasks then you could didn't have to learn new ones. They paid very well for the work, offered paid time off, retirement and really great monthly gifts even for part time employees!
The work itself is fairly monotonous, usually just loading and unloading DVD's and troubleshooting jams in the machinery, but what warehouse isn't monotonous. The flexibility to learn more positions allows a person to take on the level of challenge they are feeling up to that day.",,,Machine Operator,Former Employee,"Minneapolis, MN","August 5, 2021"

2.0,Not the best working environment,Environment was unprofessional. They didn’t pay well. Training was decent. Room for growth to becoming a leader or tier 2 representative. Contract eventually expired.,,,Customer Service Representative,Former Employee,"Farmington Hills, MI","August 4, 2021"
3.0,"High salary, no growth, selfish management.","You’ll never be paid more for a job as they pay top of market and definitely mean it. There’s a heavy amount of nepotism and friend hook ups happening at the company. If you have a disagreement or run in with a manager your chances of survival are nearly none. Netflix is the Las Vegas of jobs, gambling high risk high reward against a potential huge let down should you get on someone’s bad side. There’s virtually no growth in the company anymore as things are too corporate. Don’t believe the legends of people starting out as assistants and becoming Vice Presidents. That doesn’t happen there anymore, it’s become just another top heavy corporation. Great salary, little future, zero security.","Salary, Healthcare, Stock","Zero work/life balance, terrible middle management, no growth opportunities",Support Staff,Former Employee,"Los Angeles, CA","August 1, 2021"

5.0,Netflix Rules,"I had the best time working at Netflix. Although my position was short lived because I had other jobs, I saw room for growth within the company and I the teams.

Great job for the pay too! $15 and up!!",,,CSR - Customer Service Representative,Former Employee,"Mesa, AZ","July 19, 2021"
3.0,Company had a bad system,All Netflix cared about was getting the customer off the phone in 7 minutes or less. All they wanted you to do was send them the emails in the support page and hang up. If your average call time was above seven minutes you had to go into coaching. The more calls the more money and less helping people. Job tookcl years off my life from the stress of working 5 to 2am.,,,Customer Service Representative,Former Employee,"Frisco, TX","July 14, 2021"

5.0,"Great culture, rewarding experience.","Netflix is probably the best company I have worked for. The culture that is often spoken about is real and in practice daily. There is good support from the leadership team, a great vibe and a shared vision. The freedom that is given is initially a little hard to adjust to, some abuse it and don’t tend to last, others thrive in the environment. It’s been 4 years that I have been with Netflix and everyday feels like the first, exciting, fast paced- just overall awesome!",,,Director of Operations,Current Employee,Philippines,"April 5, 2021"
3.0,Monotonous,"It's just a typical call center. Calls come in one after another and it's usually the same conversations over and over.

2.0,Inclusivity Restructured,"I specifically left a good job w/ managers I actually trusted, to come work for Netflix because of the culture they advertised. I eventually learned the culture did not apply to me, as explained by HR. The HR Business Partner was completely ineffective & only went out of their way conceal concerns I had. Once I began to speak up, I was retaliated against.
The culture is lip service and is not practiced in the work environment. If it is, exceptions have been made and the culture does not apply to everyone. There is most definitely a ""culture of fear"" & I unfortunately witnessed it firsthand.
These were some of the slimiest managers & producers I've ever had the displeasure of working with, they possess the morals of guinea pigs.
There was also tampering with my payroll information & incorrect information purposely placed in my records.",,,Freelance Contractor,Former Employee,"Los Angeles, CA","January 31, 2021"

1.0,Unreasonable,I have never worked for a company that showed so little care about its employees. I had to deal with 2 trainers neither knowing how to do the job they are training you for. Most questions are always ignored as your told to look it up. Often times if you struggle or need any explanation during training you will get ignored completely. Half the time you are working if you need a supervisor or lead to assist in a case you'll end up waiting 20 minutes just to get a response. They fired me because I left work halfway through the day after clearly showing I was too ill to perform my duties that day. Because half a day is more important than my health. never work for this company they do not care about you and will drop you like a fly the moment you aren't a top performing model employee with near perfect health and immunity to all disease.,,,CSR,Former Employee,"Mesa, AZ","September 16, 2020"

2.0,Don't be fooled by the money,"Honestly, the only good thing about this place is the money and colleagues. Although you won't always get on well with all of your teammates. I had friends on different floors and seen them once or twice a week. The training which they say its 2 weeks is a joke. You already take your first calls from customers on the fifth day! There is so much to learn and its still only around 20 percent of everything you need to know. You will get calls with issues you weren't prepared for and ask someone who sits next to you for help. On busy understaffed days you answer up to 80 calls a day or even more, sometimes I wasn't even counting. The customers can be really rude and take out their anger on you. You can set your preferences for the schedule but it works only once in a lifetime. I worked 3 months in a row with Mondays and Tuesdays off 2pm-11pm. There is constantly some changes and its hard to keep up. You have coachings with you Team Leader where they let you listen to your own calls and tell you what went wrong and its nothing bad but they never show you your great calls. Food they provide is unhealthy, burgers, hot dogs, pasta, tacos... I mean... Each to their own but I would not recommend. Oh, if you'll be late too often you will get fired. Plus- don't go on sick leave because they won't give you another contract!! They don't accept people with mental illness!!!

2.0,"Great Company, Tough Culture, Great CEO","Netflix has continued to adapt their culture to broadly include more focus on diversity and inclusion. This has developed the work force and also helped bring a larger pool of candidates. There are still some pain points around hiring the right person for the right job. Fear is in the fabric of every employee and everyone knows that they have an expiration date. There are brilliant jerks but more jerks that are not brilliant in high-level roles. Netflix leans into risk with everything they do, which in most cases works extremely well. The hardest part of Netflix is that it becomes more important than anything else in your life so there is no work-life balance. If you can navigate through all of the entitlement, it can still be a good place to work until you can't anymore. The best thing about Netflix is the people, turnover is above 40%, which means that time is wasted on bringing in new employees instead of investing in existing ones.",,,Manager,Current Employee,"Los Angeles, CA","February 23, 2020"

4.0,"Competitive workplace, great values but poor management","Netflix as a company is amazing. Their product and values are bar none. The Netflix culture is unlike anything else and fun to be a part of. The only downfall over time has been their lack of communication and leadership at certain positions. Mismanagement and wages that havent kept up with the cost of living contribute to low agent morale and a numbers driven culture instead of behavior driven. All in all a great job that is very valuable but there is a great disconnect between working directly with Netflix, and working for one of their BPO contact centers as the focus seems to be on cost cutting and sending everything overseas.",,,Training Facilitator,Current Employee,Tampa Florida,"January 24, 2020"

4.0,"Fun space, with a lack of communication","This is a company that is good to work for if you keep yourself as a priority.

Great benefits and really good pay, but was sold off to a 3rd party company in the end",,,Recruiter,Current Employee,"Salt Lake City, UT","September 19, 2019"
1.0,They were great at first,"The job was good when they cared but they never cared about their customers. That always bothered me. The options for advancement are very one sided, and unless you are not only doing your job 150%, but schmoozing. there is no way you will ever be more than a worker. Then they sold us off completely. They did not care what it meant to any of us even the managers.",,,Customer Service Representative,Former Employee,"Salt Lake City, UT","September 8, 2019"
1.0,Nightmare,"This is by far the worst job all my coworkers there and I have ever had. Avoid at all costs. It is not worth the trouble. Out of a training class of 50, I was the sole remaining employee after 3 months. 100% turnover, zero consideration for illness (they will force you to work 10 hours days while sick or be fired), no sense of teams or community or work family, and a deranged no-escalation management culture made it thoroughly awful.",,,Customer Support Representative,Former Employee,"Portland, OR","September 6, 2019"

5.0,Best place to work,"If you are up for constant challenges and opportunities for growth, Netflix is for you. It is not a place where you can just sit and be comfy, but that is why I love it. We solve big challenges on a daily basis and I wouldn't have it any other way. It is has one of the strongest cultures I've ever been a part of and I've been in quite a few notable places. Success isn't measured in tenure, but in impact. I started as a team of 1 and have increased my impact to the business and now lead a team of 75+. If you're great at what you do and you love new challenges, Netflix is for you. If you want something cushy to just sit back and cash a check, don't bother. The Netflix culture either excites you or scares you. There really isn't a middle ground.",,,Director of Creative Studio,Current Employee,"Los Gatos, CA","August 24, 2019"
4.0,Great compensation - very cut throat culture,No structure. Studio is young compared to other traditional studios but it's still a mess with structure.

3.0,"Used to be great, eroding culture","I joined Netflix 3 years ago right before COVID. I enjoyed working there--culture was great, the best colleagues and worked on really hard challenging but fulfilling projects.

4.0,No comment,"A great Company to work for, but it like a revolving door you never no when they will let you go. Also the FTE play favorite with who they no. and the contractor are not treated the same, but they do have great perks for all employees where breakfast and lunch is served for free.

5.0,Workplace was very clean and productive,"Netflix was a nice workplace while i was there, co-workers were either very friendly or to themselves which allowed for time to either focus on work or get help very easily for work.

The management in perspective were organized and tended to their team when needed. The coaching and team meetings were very straight forward and actually progressive with the development as a team.

While working for Netflix they allowed some employees to take classes within the building to learn some tools such as excel within a class setting, while in the class we learned the basics of organizing data and being able to read it with the different options within excel.",,,Customer Service Representative,Former Employee,"Salt Lake City, UT","August 19, 2019"
2.0,They Pay very well but don't invest in their employees,"Leadership was very inconsistant and supervisors were not good at giving clear expectations. Shift bids were a very negative experience for all employess, and despite repeatedly being told, management made no effort to change. While they push strongly statments of inclusion, teamwork, culture, etc. They don't put in the footwork to make it happen.

They fired a substantial part of the Tier 3 team, and published to all employees in the department exactly why they were terminated.",,,Tier 3 Technical Research Analyst,Former Employee,"Salt Lake City, UT","August 13, 2019"

The most enjoyable part of the job was coaching, to see someone evolve and advance in the company because of ther hard work and dedication.",,,Call Center Specialist Team Lead Resource,Former Employee,"Clearwater, FL","July 25, 2019"
4.0,Fun place to work,Working for Netflix truly taught me what customer service really is and how to take care of customers. I worked here for 3 years and I met a lot of great people that made fun work. Supervisors always showed that they cared about you and made sure you always were happy and needed anything.

5.0,One of the best companies I have worked for,"I would probably still be working at Netflix if they did not move their call center away from Oregon. I may have moved locations if I did not have prior commitments that kept me in Oregon. They offered any employees a moving stipend. Upper management was as transparent as they could be to their customer service team. Some of the best direct managers and site managers I've had worked there when I did. There was always room for internal growth if you put the work in. The only downside was dealing with situations that did not involve the company. Since the service needs things like internet and electronic devices to function, irritation was often directed towards customer service when the issue was elsewhere.",,,CSR2,Former Employee,"Hillsboro, OR","March 29, 2019"
4.0,bad schedule,"If you are a young person and like to party a lot this job is fantastic.

3.0,Unexpectedly short,"The duties were easy at this company, as I was trained to maintain the daily buffets for the office of Netflix. This included set-up, refill, and break down. I eventually became the supervisor to run them at a new tech company downtown. All of the employees that I served in the office complimented me and stated that everything was turning out great. This is why I was shocked when the Wolfgang Puck director let me go, stating that I wasn't being enough of a supervisor. It also didn't make any sense considering that I was the only person on the floor running the entire buffet, so there was no one else to supervise aside from myself. Meanwhile everyone that was on the floor of the office that I served had nothing but positive feedback.",,,Front of House Supervisor,Former Employee,"Los Angeles, CA","March 13, 2019"

5.0,"Great company, terrible work","Wirking for Netflix covered both ends if the spectrum. On the plus side, the benefits and company itself were great! Flexibility, values, inexpensive insurance, no dress code, etc.
The cons though, were mainly centered around the actual phone calls. Netflix customers that call in are technologically challenged, abrasive, close minded, racist, and occasionally abusive. Which of course can be said about most customer calls, but the repetitiveness slowly grinds down your will to live until the thought of having to come in to work makes you sick. But you dont want to leave because it such a high paying job so you try to move up,anything to get away from the poisonous calls, only to be shut down again and again on the premise of having new feedback for next time. It doesnt matter if you've done the job again and again in preparation, moving up is nearly impossible.",,,Customer Service Representative,Former Employee,"Salt Lake City, UT","March 6, 2019"
5.0,great place to work,"Entertainment, like friendship, is a fundamental human need; it changes how we feel and gives us common ground. Netflix is better entertainment at lower cost and greater scale than the world has ever seen. We want to entertain everyone, and make the world smile.

This document is about our unusual employee culture.

Like all great companies, we strive to hire the best and we value integrity, excellence, respect, inclusivity, and collaboration. What is special about Netflix, though, is how much we:

encourage independent decision-making by employees
share information openly, broadly, and deliberately
are extraordinarily candid with each other
keep only our highly effective people
avoid rules
Our core philosophy is people over process. More specifically, we have great people working together as a dream team.

1.0,The position you are applying for is the one I was fired from because I didn't drink the Koolaid.,"They fired me on the last week of training (six weeks into a multi-college-semester-length [by hour] course) because I ""didn't fit within company culture."" There was no warning, no coaching or feedback. No suggestions or working with me. Just gone. When I asked why, they gave me vague things about not being a good fit and not contributing to the culture they want. They were absolutely cold and unfeeling. Threatened to have me removed from the building despite me showing no signs of agitation or desire to make a scene. I am completely shocked and have NO idea why they fired me. I was doing awesome and working great within my training group. I needed this job so badly. I'm now looking at possible homelessness and losing my car. THEY DO NOT CARE.

5.0,I loved it (when working),"the problem with working on set for a tv show is that as an actor, (unless you are the lead) there's an excellent chance you don't work all the time. This kind of instability is common in the acting profession and a reason why many actors, like myself, have other 'gigs' we do when not being used on set.

Mostly old people that can't figure out Netflix or understand that their internet is not working or too slow for Netflix to work correctly. Can't just tell them its not us. Netflix works fine its just like an app. If it works on your phone or for your neighbor then Netflix is working. Your internet isn't. So pretty much what will happen is you will get yelled at and blamed and cussed out because people are so dumb. Working at Netflix itself is fine, but that won't happen anymore because they sold the company to 24/7 wanna be teleperformance. No benefits and insurance will be insane..

They pay well and the packages are lucrative. But they demand performance and collaboration with the performance. They are always looking to push performance and find a better way. Not afraid to try something outside of the box.

They also do not like to follow utah's labor laws. They still have not given me my check almost 5 days after my termination. I do not recommend anyone get into the job.

3.0,Culture,I initially loved the culture of the company and the views they held on good customer service. I think the culture was lost a little with worrying about speed metrics over customer care.

1.0,As unprofessional as it gets,"This company is a joke. I was cornered and more or less pressured to quit due to a chronic illness. When it was promised I was eligible for rehire, I thought they would stick to it. Even though the previous experience was awful, I thought the pay would be worth going back to. I reapplied once I was in better health, and got a call. Not only did they not look at my resume, I had to explain to them I actually had worked there before. The recruiter then stopped asking questions and said ""well then you know all of this already"". Against better judgement, I believed him when he said I'd get a call back to set up an interview, they were excited at the prospect of having me back. It's been almost a month. Not a single call or email. THIS IS JUST THE HIRING PROCESS. It only gets worse once you get hired. The training is absolutely worthless. When I originally trained, they told us that the floor was totally different, and not to worry about what we learned in the classroom. Management played favorites. Gaining and losing advancement opportunities became personal. If anyone complained about a favored person or procedure, suddenly they were gone and ""no longer a social fit for the company"". They used harsh critique and peer pressure, warped the rules to keep or cut employees. Perks were slowly being removed and policies were being changed so often we couldn't keep up. When confronted about the lack of perks or incentive, management told us that getting paid should be enough. They don't care about their employees, but they also don't care about the customer. Half of the time we would send",,,CSR - Customer Service Representative,Former Employee,"Salt Lake City, UT","November 17, 2017"

4.0,tldr: Netflix is awesome but isn't all it's cracked up to be,"A typical day at work was taking phone calls, helping customers troubleshoot their Netflix. I learned a lot working for Netflix, some supervisors were really awesome and wiling to help you learn more about different departments while others were more about you just doing your job instead of helping you develop. Netflix says they are all about the ""culture,"" but what they preach is not everything you see when you actually start working there. A lot of what they say, doesn't actually happen. Which I get, sometimes it doesn't meet the business needs. But it shouldn't be promised if they are not going to go through with it. They were making some changes that were definitely going in the right direction which I was super excited to be a part of, but sadly because of some of their policies that they are just playing with in attendance area, I am no longer able to participate in. My favorite parts of the job was the people I got to work with and being able to dress and have my hair how I wanted. Though my number 1 favorite part was the chat department which they got ""rid"" of.

The downside is the high turnover. Although not as bad as previously, it can have you walking on eggshells. I watched some new employees struggle to get up to speed with the constantly-changing environment.

Another good thing is the training. They explain what's expected of you with demos, slides, and hands on. Coworkers are very friendly/helpful.

3.0,Company is going through growing pains - highly unstable,"Netflix has a tremendous amount of potential but you cannot trust your project managers to be truthful and organized. It's like working for a startup but without the fun, and open discussion.
You get all the instability from a startup, meaning colleagues are fired without notice;team changes. Also, the external vendors are mistreated like crazy. This reflects poorly on the corporate culture.

4.0,An amazing experience.,"My typical day at work was pretty simple if all went well. My job was to answer questions, comments, and concerns with the website and the product we were providing as well as assisting with devices customers where using. It was a new challenge for each call and that was what kept it fun for myself. You would have a few bad eggs of course, but that rarely slowed down the pace of the day overall. Management told you how you could improve on your calls, and co-workers would talk to you during breaks about what they do when you run into a sticky situation. The hardest part about the job was having a rush of callers that gave us no breathing room in between to collect ourselves again. This, however, is standard with most jobs involving customer interaction. Also, compared to the number of customers they have, we were only helping a very small percentage of the overall user base.

5.0,Fun and productive work environment with amazing coworkers,Typical day at work is coworkers greeting me as I walk in the call center and customers eager to speak to me to have their issues resolved. I learned that it's easier to sympathize with a customer than to argue. Hardest part about the job is staying confident in yourself when you have angry customers criticizing you for mistakes that may have been on their part.

3.0,They do not care.,"NetflixCS claims to be different from any other call center environment in many ways. The problem is that, with every development, there are several setbacks. NetflixCS has outsourced many departments and has shown little interest in promoting or retaining talented employees. As with many other similar customer service jobs, they simply do not care, and are just as happy to replace you as they are to hire you. Simply having acceptable compensation and benefits does not a good work environment make.",,,CSR - Customer Service Representative,Former Employee,"Salt Lake City, UT","August 28, 2016"
3.0,It Is a Great Job to an Extent,"The job is not a difficult job, but it is very redundant and the constantly want improvement even when improvement is not easy.

However, they gave little opportunity for in house promotions though originally promised all promotions would be in house.

The smallest mistake could cost you your job, particularly if the overly-powerful HR business partners take issue with it. There are some good people there, but by and large the complete lack of job security (they don't hesitate to fire people) creates a CYA culture whereby senior management (directors and above) line their organizations with potential ""fall guys"" that they can lay the blame on (and fire) in the event that anything goes wrong. At least they pay good severance (4-9 months of salary, depending on level).

I enjoyed working at this place, but once you get on managements nerves, they will lay you off and tell you the reason is that you do not know how to repair the machines, which I did and was one of the few people that would actually repair the machines. Another issue was breaks, sometimes they do their best to work you as long as possible without giving you a break, even so by breaking the law and having you work over four hours straight, which I have done multiple times. They also tell you that you can call for breaks, which they gave me the power and then they yell at you for calling breaks. If you ask for breaks, they usually say no despite you working 4 hours, which I have called for a break without permission a few times. The reason not getting a raise is because my attitude was supposely bad because I would ask for a break or ask about when I was getting the raise I was promised.

Anytime a group of individuals come together there is potential for conflict due to inherent differences in personality, politics, disagreements and misunderstandings. Over all great team of co-workers.

Mail sort operations run at a very fast pace. Mail runs through sorters set to read bar codes at pieces per second and you have to be very fast and at the top of your game to be able to keep up, this would be the most difficult aspect of the job.

Netflix's culture is unlike anything I have ever seen. They promote freedom and responsibility and they mean it. You are 100% accountable for the performance of your location, and I love that. They are the world's biggest entertainment distributor in both streaming and physical media, but it's not so big that you can't sedn an email to or call up one of the directors of the company.

Co-workers were great. Upper management were very knowledgeable in production, but not in service, so that's where the maintenance crew came in. Hardest part of the job was the travel and having to have finished all the work required before coming home, or else I don't come home until the job was done. (Not usually an issue with me cause I always get the job done). The most enjoyable part of the job was that there was always a challenge. No two day were the same and I was always upj for anything.",,,Operations Equipment Technician,Former Employee,"San Jose, CA","October 11, 2012"

3.0,"NO vacation or holiday pay, weird hours. Discourage time off.","Managment is very deceiving, takes weeks to get an answer out of them, IF you get an answer at all.
Co-workers don't really care about anyone but themselves. It's a very alienable shop. They don't encourage comraderie with co-workers, in fact, they prefer that you just come in, do your job, and don't really talk to anyone, especially shop talk.
The hardest part of the job is most people have split weekends, and God forbid if you request time off. They consider it the same as if you called in sick. They hold any little thing against you. permanently.

1.0,Without a doubt the worst job I've ever had.,"The only way to succeed at Netflix is if you have the knack for making sleazy, exploitative policies sound less objectionable than they really are. In Netflix culture this is referred to as ""positive positioning,"" but the majority of customers correctly interpret it as ""trying to make the people you've ripped off feel good about being separated from their money."" In order to hang onto your job, you need to consistently meet a set of metrics (including AHT and customer satisfaction rate) that can change arbitrarily at any time. Customer satisfaction is determined by a one-question survey issued at the conclusion of each call which asks only whether the customer was satisfied with their experience with Netflix. No distinction is made between the company and the rep, so even if you did your level best to assist the customer you can still be rated unsatisfactory if they're upset about a price hike or something else that's entirely out of your control. The turnover rate is unbelievably high, there is nothing resembling job security, and if you're a temp-to-hire your conversion (which comes with a pay increase and health benefits) can be continually delayed for virtually no reason. Also, a lot of the customers are outrageously rude and hostile and there's nothing you can do about it.",,,Customer service representative,Former Employee,"Hillsboro, OR","July 18, 2012"
2.0,Too much turnover,"Wasn't to fond of this place to be honest. The working environment was unconventional. I learned that I never want to work shifts other than 1st. The hardest part was having to be there at 3am Monday - Friday.

3.0,Actively Downsizing,"Netflix is a decent company. They pay their employees fairly well. However, they are actively downsizing, and management either never has any idea what's ahead, or they don't plan ahead with the knowledge they do have.

1.0,A horrible working environment,"Netflix treats their employees as completely disposable. They seem to constantly be looking for reasons to fire any and all of their employees, including supervisors. Supposedly, this sort of fear-driven culture, where working there a year is considered being a veteran (which is absurd), will give Netflix customers better service. I don't believe it does.

When call volume drops, employees get laid off. When call volume increases, massive numbers of people are hired and employees are sometimes forced to work overtime.

Everyone is temp-to-hire to make the firing of virtually all employees easier. Only senior management lasts at Netflix.",,,Customer Service Representative,Former Employee,"Hillsboro, OR","May 22, 2012"

2.0,Human Shield vs the meat grinder,"It takes an half an hour to an hour just to get to the center.

Should you need too use the bathroom other than your 10 minute break, it would found aggenst your availability. which is 5 min total per day out of the Q. If that happens you can be written up or terminated.
95% of the customers hate the service therefore don't like you no matter what. and remark you down on the survey. too many bad marks and you will be written up or terminated.
Supervisors have the same metrics for the whole team so they have to watch out for themselves.
This job payed well for having to sit around all day; however it was the worst experience ever. I left everyday hating my life.
When your company hates you and the customers hate you, for things you cannot control such as price change, internet bandwidth fluctuations and shipping issues. seriously.

4.0,Gezellige helpdesk werk met een filmpje op z'n tijd,"Het is een super leuk, jong en dynamisch bedrijf. Gezellige sfeer, met door groei mogelijkheden. Een dag bij Netflix is hard werken maar ook veel plezier maken met elkaar.

Toen ik hier kwam werken had ik geen ervaring in de call center, wel heb ik 6 jaar in de horeca gewerkt. En heb ik verschillende productie/administratieve stages gehad. Ik heb geleerd hoe ik klanten een fijn gevoel aan de telefoon kan geven en een gesprek gaande te houden.

De mensen die hier werken zijn over het algemeen jong, leergierig en gezellig. De een wilt door groeien naar teamleader en een ander vind het prima om call agent te blijven. Maar iedereen kan het met elkaar vinden, en niemand geeft een ander het gevoel dat hij/zij minder waardig is.

Het moeilijkste is om mensen soms een nee te moeten verkopen, in de zin van, het is bij ons (momenteel) niet mogelijk om verder nog iets voor u te doen. Tijdelijk is er een storing waar niets aan gedaan kan worden. En natuurlijk hoop je dat de klanten daar begrip voor hebben maar dat is niet altijd het geval.

Het leukste is dat je veel kunt lachen en genieten, met collega's en dat er toch nog een onderscheid is tussen wie manager, teamleader of agent is.",,,Call agent,Current Employee,Amstedam,"May 2, 2017"

3.0,"Used to be great, eroding culture","I joined Netflix 3 years ago right before COVID. I enjoyed working there--culture was great, the best colleagues and worked on really hard challenging but fulfilling projects. Sadly, with the rising competition and immense growth, the culture of the company has shifted extensively. HR does little to address issues with regards to compensation and performance.
