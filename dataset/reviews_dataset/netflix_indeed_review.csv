When I first arrived at Netflix I felt a sigh of relief. I became an expert at my 1 job and even took on some additional duties but lately it seems they are trying to pile on more duties to cut costs and keep from hiring/filling departments.

1.0,Unwritten Rules,"Freelancer (Former Employee) - Hollywood, CA - November 27, 2022","Quality of work is in decline. There are ""no rules"", so employees can act unethically and immorally. There are a lot of ""unwritten rules"". A lot of ""Mean Girls""-like mentality. Popularity is valued more than expertise or logical reasoning and insight. Managers flat out state ""I don't care"". Onboarding was incorrect and compromised job performance. Payroll lied. Accountability is evaded. Human Resources made things worse. Executive titles and ""managing directors"" spent more time slacking defamatory gossip and non-work-related nonsense, as opposed to modeling leadership.",,

3.0,High Performance Culture to Challenge You,"HR (Former Employee) - Los Angeles, CA - November 17, 2022","Netflix asks for a lot from its employees. They pay well, but it's not uncommon for your family to feel like they're the second priority. You are asked to show up fully and with vulnerability (aka seek feedback and give feedback), but the risk is you're then judged. There is not a lot of sincere compassion or curiosity from leadership for the employee experience. The sentiment is""love it or leave it"" and ""it's not for everybody."" That lack of empathy plays out even more harshly if an employee is from a historically excluded community.",,
1.0,1 star,"Customer Service Representative (Former Employee) - Fremont, CA - November 17, 2022","What is the best part of working at the company?

3.0,Sometimes good sometimes bad,"Team Lead (Former Employee) - Denver, CO - June 15, 2022",Always had contests to make the work environment a great place to work. I do not know if the stressful calls without much help for management is worth sticking around for the contests. Seems like there is always a shift bid going on and the available shifts change dramatically within each 3 month period. This makes it hard for people with kids. You may get a 6am to 2pm shift one time and then company will get rid of that shift all together and depending on where you are in seniority or stats yuh could end up with a 4pm to midnight shift. You just never know.,,
3.0,Horrible Management,"Project Manager (Former Employee) - Remote - May 30, 2022","Even with 9+ years of experience in my field, I was micromanaged to death! Disgusting lack of trust and inherent fear amongst teammates. Abysmal leadership.

I was also thrown onto multiple projects on my third week without any guidance.

I finally felt like I had found a stable job with reasonable pay and benefits that I could work at forever and work my way up. I felt such pride working for this company and that was a huge deal for me. I wanted to work somewhere brag worthy, and that call center was it. I loved literally everyone I worked with. I'm not sure I'll ever feel as satisfied working any other job and I wish daily they didn't outsource all their call centers and shut us down. It's been years and I still miss that job.",,

1.0,Just terrible,"Customer Service Associate (Former Employee) - Hillsboro, OR - March 22, 2022","My 3 years there were the 3 worst years of my working life. It was an awful experience working with a company bloated with too many inept managers. I was ultimately let go for reading a gardening book at my desk between calls, a rule that was never written down and none of my colleagues had heard spoken. They were a bunch of no talent clowns.",,

2.0,Tense and stressful workplace,"Production Assistant (Former Employee) - Cleveland, OH - March 18, 2022","Judging by the questions, I’m assuming this doesn’t have to do with working on set for Netflix. All I can say is, out of the couple times I ended up working for Netflix, specifically the last time: the management was the worst out of any job I’ve ever worked. The policies were absolutely ludicrous to the point where changes had to be made urgently in the middle of the project. I wouldn’t care if they knew who wrote this.",Guaranteed long work,"Short breaks, no breaks, awful bosses, disrespect is a norm."
4.0,Dream job while you're useful,"Project Manager (Former Employee) - Los Angeles, CA - March 14, 2022","Disclaimer: I was laid off as part of a reorganization (1 of 10), but I would have written the same review had I been the one who was spared. In the 5+ years that I worked at NF, 4 first years were awesome. I often felt elated, I loved going to work both physically and then virtually due to COVID. Mature, caring colleagues, interesting work, lots of learning, wonderful connections. I joined when my team was in the startup phase, and it was the best time for ideas and trying new things with no budget limitations. Gradually, over the course of the following 5 years, the need to scale led to constant changes, both of leadership and workflows. Team leaders were being ""let go"" on average every 1.5 years if not sooner. There was barely enough time to become good at what one does as yet another big reorg/title change would come around. Lastly, the team came under the leadership of people who had absolutely no knowledge of the team's specialty, but were ""experts"" in strategizing and optimizing processes.
Eventually it shifted from being people-driven to process-driven, from collegial to top-down. The bottom line started winning over quality while business needs outweighed everything else.
Pros:
Awesome colleagues
Productive work environment
Top of market pay, nice perks
Lots of learning opportunities through constant change

Cons:
Low job security
Process driven vs people driven
Constant change
High level of ambiguity",,

3.0,Generally a decent place but turnover is high and work appreciation is low,"Administrative Assistant (Former Employee) - Los Angeles, CA - February 4, 2022","I initially enjoyed working here but I noticed that sometimes you’re not appreciated for the work that you do well and, instead, you’re criticized for what you may not do well. Scheduling and calendar management are major for assistants but they’ll also throw project work on you which is what a coordinator should be doing - not an admin.",,
2.0,"The over emphasis on DEI is maddening
Their entire company is modeled around 1 percent of the population","Artist (Current Employee) - Burbank, CA - January 29, 2022","Job security is zero. Once your contract is up you need to re-apply to work on another project.
Constant emphasis on inclusion and diversity makes it feel like that is the only reason the company exist.
And if you don’t agree, of course, you are not included.",,
1.0,"Sounds great from the outside, totally different on the inside","Engineer (Current Employee) - Los Angeles, CA - December 16, 2021","Be ready to be worked into the dirt. There's no such thing as a work-life balance here.

Managers protect each other and act counter to the company culture, then gaslight you by saying you're misinterpreting the culture.

Politics is the only way to get ahead and be ready to be passed up for promotions or more responsibilities by those who play the game better, even if their work is terrible.",,

3.0,Basic Call Center,"Customer Service Representative (Former Employee) - Hillsboro, OR - August 31, 2021","Not a great place to work. Expectations were high, morale was low. Nearly unreachable goals and management was just the guy who sat next to you who had the best call times.",,
5.0,Best place I have ever worked,"Machine Operator (Former Employee) - Minneapolis, MN - August 5, 2021","The DVD.com hub I worked at was wonderful, very few employees, very laid-back atmosphere, but highly efficient and productive, encouraging self-motivation. If you wanted to learn more positions, you could, if you were content with the same tasks then you could didn't have to learn new ones. They paid very well for the work, offered paid time off, retirement and really great monthly gifts even for part time employees!
The work itself is fairly monotonous, usually just loading and unloading DVD's and troubleshooting jams in the machinery, but what warehouse isn't monotonous. The flexibility to learn more positions allows a person to take on the level of challenge they are feeling up to that day.",,
2.0,Not the best working environment,"Customer Service Representative (Former Employee) - Farmington Hills, MI - August 4, 2021",Environment was unprofessional. They didn’t pay well. Training was decent. Room for growth to becoming a leader or tier 2 representative. Contract eventually expired.,,
3.0,"High salary, no growth, selfish management.","Support Staff (Former Employee) - Los Angeles, CA - August 1, 2021","You’ll never be paid more for a job as they pay top of market and definitely mean it. There’s a heavy amount of nepotism and friend hook ups happening at the company. If you have a disagreement or run in with a manager your chances of survival are nearly none. Netflix is the Las Vegas of jobs, gambling high risk high reward against a potential huge let down should you get on someone’s bad side. There’s virtually no growth in the company anymore as things are too corporate. Don’t believe the legends of people starting out as assistants and becoming Vice Presidents. That doesn’t happen there anymore, it’s become just another top heavy corporation. Great salary, little future, zero security.",,

3.0,Company had a bad system,"Customer Service Representative (Former Employee) - Frisco, TX - July 14, 2021",All Netflix cared about was getting the customer off the phone in 7 minutes or less. All they wanted you to do was send them the emails in the support page and hang up. If your average call time was above seven minutes you had to go into coaching. The more calls the more money and less helping people. Job tookcl years off my life from the stress of working 5 to 2am.,,

The culture that is often spoken about is real and in practice daily. There is good support from the leadership team, a great vibe and a shared vision. The freedom that is given is initially a little hard to adjust to, some abuse it and don’t tend to last, others thrive in the environment.

I eventually learned the culture did not apply to me, as explained by HR. The HR Business Partner was completely ineffective & only went out of their way conceal concerns I had. Once I began to speak up, I was retaliated against.
The culture is lip service and is not practiced in the work environment. If it is, exceptions have been made and the culture does not apply to everyone. There is most definitely a ""culture of fear"" & I unfortunately witnessed it firsthand.
These were some of the slimiest managers & producers I've ever had the displeasure of working with, they possess the morals of guinea pigs.

Half the time you are working if you need a supervisor or lead to assist in a case you'll end up waiting 20 minutes just to get a response.

2.0,Don't be fooled by the money,"Customer Service Representative (CSR) (Former Employee) - Amsterdam, Netherlands - February 27, 2020","Honestly, the only good thing about this place is the money and colleagues. Although you won't always get on well with all of your teammates. I had friends on different floors and seen them once or twice a week. The training which they say its 2 weeks is a joke. You already take your first calls from customers on the fifth day! There is so much to learn and its still only around 20 percent of everything you need to know. You will get calls with issues you weren't prepared for and ask someone who sits next to you for help. On busy understaffed days you answer up to 80 calls a day or even more, sometimes I wasn't even counting. The customers can be really rude and take out their anger on you. You can set your preferences for the schedule but it works only once in a lifetime. I worked 3 months in a row with Mondays and Tuesdays off 2pm-11pm. There is constantly some changes and its hard to keep up. You have coachings with you Team Leader where they let you listen to your own calls and tell you what went wrong and its nothing bad but they never show you your great calls. Food they provide is unhealthy, burgers, hot dogs, pasta, tacos... I mean... Each to their own but I would not recommend. Oh, if you'll be late too often you will get fired.

2.0,"Great Company, Tough Culture, Great CEO","Manager (Current Employee) - Los Angeles, CA - February 23, 2020","Netflix has continued to adapt their culture to broadly include more focus on diversity and inclusion. This has developed the work force and also helped bring a larger pool of candidates. There are still some pain points around hiring the right person for the right job. Fear is in the fabric of every employee and everyone knows that they have an expiration date. There are brilliant jerks but more jerks that are not brilliant in high-level roles. Netflix leans into risk with everything they do, which in most cases works extremely well. The hardest part of Netflix is that it becomes more important than anything else in your life so there is no work-life balance. If you can navigate through all of the entitlement, it can still be a good place to work until you can't anymore. The best thing about Netflix is the people, turnover is above 40%, which means that time is wasted on bringing in new employees instead of investing in existing ones.",,

The culture is great but stressful seeing good people shown the door. If you don't fit or are no longer useful you get a ""generous severance package.""

They pay well and the packages are lucrative. But they demand performance and collaboration with the performance. They are always looking to push performance and find a better way. Not afraid to try something outside of the box.

Even though the previous experience was awful, I thought the pay would be worth going back to. I reapplied once I was in better health, and got a call. Not only did they not look at my resume, I had to explain to them I actually had worked there before. The recruiter then stopped asking questions and said ""well then you know all of this already"". Against better judgement, I believed him when he said I'd get a call back to set up an interview, they were excited at the prospect of having me back. It's been almost a month. Not a single call or email. THIS IS JUST THE HIRING PROCESS. It only gets worse once you get hired. The training is absolutely worthless. When I originally trained, they told us that the floor was totally different, and not to worry about what we learned in the classroom. Management played favorites. Gaining and losing advancement opportunities became personal. If anyone complained about a favored person or procedure, suddenly they were gone and ""no longer a social fit for the company"". They used harsh critique and peer pressure, warped the rules to keep or cut employees. Perks were slowly being removed and policies were being changed so often we couldn't keep up.

Netflix says they are all about the ""culture,"" but what they preach is not everything you see when you actually start working there. A lot of what they say, doesn't actually happen. Which I get, sometimes it doesn't meet the business needs. But it shouldn't be promised if they are not going to go through with it. They were making some changes that were definitely going in the right direction which I was super excited to be a part of, but sadly because of some of their policies that they are just playing with in attendance area, I am no longer able to participate in.

Tijdelijk is er een storing waar niets aan gedaan kan worden. En natuurlijk hoop je dat de klanten daar begrip voor hebben maar dat is niet altijd het geval.

It was a new challenge for each call and that was what kept it fun for myself. You would have a few bad eggs of course, but that rarely slowed down the pace of the day overall. Management told you how you could improve on your calls, and co-workers would talk to you during breaks about what they do when you run into a sticky situation. The hardest part about the job was having a rush of callers that gave us no breathing room in between to collect ourselves again. This, however, is standard with most jobs involving customer interaction. Also, compared to the number of customers they have, we were only helping a very small percentage of the overall user base. In short, the customers that called were the ones that definitely needed our help.",,

3.0,They do not care.,"CSR - Customer Service Representative (Former Employee) - Salt Lake City, UT - August 28, 2016","NetflixCS claims to be different from any other call center environment in many ways. The problem is that, with every development, there are several setbacks. NetflixCS has outsourced many departments and has shown little interest in promoting or retaining talented employees. As with many other similar customer service jobs, they simply do not care, and are just as happy to replace you as they are to hire you.
