 - Amazon is built, quite deliberately, to be Darwinian.  You can generally expect that anyone who's been here for more than 2 years is competent and motivated or they wouldn't have survived.  You can count on them as long as your priorities are aligned.  There aren't many slackers here, and they don't survive long.
  - We work on so much stuff that there's always an opportunity to find amazing cool stuff to work on (note that it's an 'opportunity', one that you have to pursue)
  - A chance to make a huge difference
  - A place where you can learn a lot about all kinds of things, both technical and about yourself
  - Amazon encourages high mobility - even your manager can't prevent you from moving to another team within 6 weeks (normally, more than a few months under unusual conditions).
  - Your friends and family have actually heard of the place you work and have at least a vague notion of what Amazon does without you having to explain","- You're responsible for your own career progression and finding the places and teams that are doing the stuff you want to do. No one is going to take you by the hand and help you with that.
- Amazon is built, quite deliberately, to be Darwinian. The strong survive and the weak perish (metaphorically speaking) and the 'bar' is constantly increasing. The level of performance that would have been acceptable five years ago will get you canned today.  It's a kind of crucible that'll help you develop a harder edge, if you can survive, that can serve you well in your career and in life, but it's often not a pleasant experience.

4,5.0,An Amazing Place to Work,"I've been at Amazon for a month now, and I've seen none of the horror stories being communicated to the public, although Amazon is a large enough company that I'm sure there are good pockets and bad pockets. Everyone here is really smart, and wants to succeed both personally, and as a company. People collaborate and help each other, focus on data, and truly focus on the customer. Every company I've ever worked for talks about how important the customer is, but on day 2, they're forgotten. Amazon seems to genuinely focus on what's best for the customer, and it's awesome to be in meetings where people actually bring that up, and make decisions focused on long-term customer satisfaction.

The opportunities to learn here are literally unlimited, and the opportunity to take on new responsibility is as well. I honestly believe you can be as awesome as you want here.","No cons, so far - seriously. Like I said, I'm sure Amazon has some bad pockets in it here and there, but this is an amazing job, an amazing opportunity, and the biggest thing I have to complain about is that it's a little chilly in our building. I can live with that.

Does Amazon demand high quality, measurable results? Yes! Is it hard work? Yes! Is it rewarding? Yes! So I'm not calling that a 'con'. Work/life balance seems comparable to other places I've worked - not worse.",Software Development Manager,Current Employee,"Phoenix, AZ","Feb 23, 2018"

6,4.0,We are now in a world where we are condescended to by our inferiors,This company gets A list performance from C list employees.  The culture is quick and hard charging.  You are always working in relevant and meaningful projects.,"Maybe because the company recruits C listers who have neither merit (intelligence, strategic vision) nor pedigree (academic or professional accomplishments), most of those who become successful do so in treacherous, low cunning ways.

Imagine the Lannisters in Game of Thrones attacking the Starks in Game of Thrones; or Rawls and Burrell attacking McNulty and Daniels in The Wire; or Barrow and O'Brien attacking Mr Bates in Downton Abbey.  This is every day leadership behavior at Amazon.  The culture at Amazon is so infested with these middling talent weasels who have juked the stats and schemed their way to positions of power that new employees coming in actually start thinking that this behavior is normal and expected if you want to ""manage people.""

The work itself was stimulating and fulfilling, but the sneering condescension of the d bags that cheated and skated their way through high school and party colleges, then just converted their winky nod nod good 'ol boy shenanigans into a ""ask no questions, have no introspection"" company culture have made manifest some of the worst criticisms of capitalism.  Any left leaning political aspirant would look at this business organism and immediately have content to lash out against the corruption that can come in free enterprise where hard work is not rewarded, and the connected, incestuous, privileged class lounge their way to wealth while treating their employees and customers like some kind of filth their shoe picked up on the street.",Anonymous Employee,Former Employee,"Seattle, WA","Mar 23, 2017"

8,4.0,A huge diverse high tech company with all sorts of stuff,"Disclaimer: My opinions reflect that of an SDE in Amazon. Seems like some operational job functions are very tough.

I have read through some of the other Amazon reviews and it seems to me that everyone has a very different experience! This is so true. Within the same team, you can have both workaholics and slackers coexisting and coworking together. I think I am more of the balanced type as I try to stay sane. The Amazon experience is basically the entire spectrum and it is what you make it out to be.

Pros in Amazon certainly excludes great benefits, but compensation is competitive. Free food means average quality free coffee, once in a while free pizza for lunch where it is a working lunch, and free beer and finger food in special events. We get a free Orca card to take any bus in the Seattle area for free. $160 per month subsidy for office parking, which is better than nothing. Downtown monthly parking goes for about $200 per month. 401K contribution is 50% of what you put in, where you can put in max 4% of your salary. Not so great. Staff cafeteria food is average and not at all cheaper than outside food, or could be even more expensive. It is hard not to complain about the cafeteria. Vacation days are ok but note that there are no sick leaves. They count as part of your 5 personal days per year. Listing the benefits of Amazon is like listing the cons and not the pros.

Work life balance seems to be ok for the most part, and seems to be individually-driven. No one will tell you that you have to come in at what time and stay till what time. I have team mates working every night and weekend, and others getting in at 10am and leaving at 5pm, all in the same team. Managers will focus on your project deliveries instead of how much time you spend working. If you work 40-hour weeks productively, you can definitely outperform someone who works 60-hour weeks but don't deliver stuff. Working less than 40 hours per week is somewhat common, but I can't say how many people are working how long. The view on work life balance is a bit skewed. All it comes down to are the managers and what they think. Projects are always never-ending but I have found that deadlines are very realistic and reasonable, without counting your nights and weekends. Getting some slack time once in a while is probably a sign of a healthy work environment. Everyone needs a break.

On-call really really sucks. Basically all it comes down to is having SDEs double-duty as support operations engineers. Note that on-call does not improve the code quality of any team in any way. The on-call experience is particularly bad because you are using services from some other team, and their code is of low quality and fails for the wrong reasons. If the managers had given more time to up the quality, there would not be so many problems. Software is usually delivered with a tough deadline with code that meets the minimum quality bar and never gets improved for the next few years. The code review process does not seem to help improve the code but it really obstructs developers from making great changes as unconventional things will not pass code review in clumsy minds. Innovation and excellence are not the name of the game in Amazon. Searching through the Amazon code base is usually not going to turn up quality code that you can actually reuse.

Integration is the name of the game in Amazon. You will need to spend a lot of time to figure out how to integrate your code with another team's services. Whether these other people are cooperative is a hit-or-miss. I have found that most people are responsive and helpful, but there are also quite a number of jerks who are out to make trouble for everybody. It is not easy to work across teams but the experience is mostly positive.

Amazon is a huge behemoth and is hiring people like there is no tomorrow. This reflects well on a good growth momentum but also is worrying that the company is not turning much profit. If the company does not make money, where is our bonus going to come from? You can see new faces around the Amazon building almost everyday! Downside is that we are taking in a lot of average to above-average engineers and being an Amazonian SDE certainly does not share the same reputation as the top names. Amazon is a huge mixed bag of some very talented people and some very dumb people. I think the world is not turning up enough SDEs and the only way is for quality to go downhill.

As an SDE, expect to spend most of your time talking, writing emails and documents, and maybe around 20-30% of your time coding. In most of the teams, you can work on interesting projects, but probably not revolutionary ones. Note that Amazon is a very down-to-earth company and the work is very down-to-earth as well. You will work on real things that people have actually requested for, and that people will start using as soon as you are done. Work is challenging but not to expect highly technically complex stuff. Most of the work has to do with solving everyday problems. To me, this seems to make sense because I have ever tried working on experimental projects before elsewhere and I did not feel it was a good use of my time.

Internal mobility is a key strength of Amazon, and I am not sure which company has done better than Amazon in this aspect. Internal moves are easy. You only need to stay in your team for a year before moving to a different team. There is no easy way to tell which team is a good team to move to because they all have their different pros and cons and people and coming and leaving all the time!

Seattle is by much rumour an easier place to live than the Bay area.

Overall Amazon is a tough but yet sane place to work. The flexibility of this company is really its core strength. You have the freedom to excel as much as you want and also to slack as much as you want. Bummer. You shouldn't be slacking!","Beware of bad managers and horrible team mates. They are not specific to Amazon but they do exist in Amazon.

I have to admit that Monday is usually a blue day at Amazon and it is very tough to look forward to getting into office. I don't know anyone in Amazon who looks forward to getting in on Mondays.

Be realistic about SDE requirements. Coding skills are good to have but they are not the most important part of your job. I think we are hearing the same thing from every company.

Medical coverage is average or below average. Expect to pay about $60 per month for singles and about $240 per month for families. $240 per month for families gives you $3000 in medical fees before you have to pay (more) anything out-of-pocket.

SDE advancement is unreal difficult. They have about 6 levels total, SDE 1-4, then Senior Principal Engineer, and finally Distinguished Engineer. The number of SDE 1s and 2s are huge. Trying to get to SDE 3 seems to be all-of-a-sudden extremely difficult, but not impossible. So this essentially means that if you come to Amazon as a fresh grad SDE, expect to get about only one or two promotions in your entire career, which obviously is quite a lame expectation and reality. You will probably do much better in your career advancement anywhere else.

Employee retention is horrible. I am not sure why the philosophy seems to be trying to undercut existing employees and then hire from external sources. Management all say that they are trying to retain people, but actions don't seem to suggest anything better. Rumour has it that annual pay raises are horrible. This basically mean that either you are a superstar in the company before they will try to retain you, or if you are smart you should not stay in Amazon for too long.",Software Development Engineer,Current Employe,"Seattle, WA","Sep 19, 2014"

Providing opportunities for employees to acquire new skills and advance their careers can also help attract and retain top talent. Improve workplace safety: While Amazon has implemented various safety protocols, continuing to prioritize safety and implementing additional measures to prevent accidents and injuries can help improve employee morale and reduce turnover. Foster a positive company culture: Creating a positive company culture can improve employee morale and engagement, leading to better performance and lower turnover rates. This could involve encouraging teamwork, recognizing and rewarding employee achievements, and promoting a healthy work-life balance. Offer competitive compensation and benefits: Offering competitive compensation and benefits packages can help attract and retain top talent, while also improving employee morale and job satisfaction.

14,1.0,Death by a thousand paper cuts,Amazon offers competitive salaries to employees.,"Amazon has a well-deserved reputation for terrible work-life balance and poor career prospects for software engineers. While the prevailing understanding of 2022-2023 layoffs blames over-hiring, engineers during this time were still working incredibly demanding shifts, often 50-60 hours per week, suggesting the problem of overburdened engineers is likely caused by something other than not having enough talent or labor. While leaders enjoy and promote the culture of “ownership,” that very culture coupled with expectations of high turnover and meager documentation means that actual development is usually hindered by years of inscrutable tech debt for any given product along with key gaps in institutional knowledge left by former employees.

Best way to maintain your production and achieve the fastest time is by waiting till break and never stop stowing The biggest Con for me was during my time of employment I was dealing with depression and mental health problems due to losing one of the greatest friends/mentor, my sister who left behind a beautiful daughter. Sense this was the most traumatic thing that's could possibly happen I took a medical leave for a mental health program at Bradford. Well after completing the course I uploaded my documents to return to work. And the ERC Kept requesting more info and my doctor wouldn't allow it says that's all the information they need so after 4 months of being off the schedule I finally got erc to accept it but then my a to z app never put me back on the schedule. Which obviously has nothing to do with me but they insisted that I missed over 30 days of work and said I must either resign or get fired",Material Handler,Current Employee,"Mount Juliet, TN","Feb 23, 2023"

You’ll make the same pay as you did while L3 even though you’re operating as L4-L5 engineer which pays on average 2-3x more.

When you join the company builds a 15% appreciation in your RSU vesting schedule yearly to give you less money but now that the stock has dropped, the company has told everyone to deal with it.

Insult to injury; YOU will be the ones responsible for training your leaders in their new roles while THEY reap a pay structure and compensation you'll never collect on. Even if you grow organically from within and are promoted to their rank you will NEVER bring home what they do with their overly generous compensation packages. If you display any modicum of competence they will trap you in your role and constantly over-leverage you knowing they can delegate everything they are either too lazy or inexperienced to complete themselves. The majority of them lack any time management or accountability whatsoever and promotions are largely based on politics and favoritism NOT your work-ethic and accolades. Any attempt to disagree and commit (a company leadership principle) will be met with hostility and their every effort to supplant you ensuring you never prosper within their organization.

It may be in other areas, for all I know, and I expect it is. But there are also plenty of subcultures that are manageable and fun. The Product Knowledge ontology team is one of those. Good on-ramping time and materials. The company doesn't ask too much of me too soon, and the training is high in production value and usually relevant to what I do. Once you're in, the company is large with a lot of different things you could do. So, if you don't find the perfect fit when you first join, transferring is very possible and common. Getting in the door is the hardest part. Pay and benefits were competitive, in my experience. I don't think that is a universal experience, though.","The systems at Amazon are very unique to Amazon. It's unlikely that you'll come here and be able to hit the ground running on building the taxonomy. OWL skills, for instance, aren't very applicable at this point.

Good on-ramping time and materials. The company doesn't ask too much of me too soon, and the training is high in production value and usually relevant to what I do. Once you're in, the company is large with a lot of different things you could do. So, if you don't find the perfect fit when you first join, transferring is very possible and common.

331,2.0,Bashing my head against the wall,Easy to get in for first job if you meet the requirements (bachelors in anything) and can move to an available position. Autonomy over time off (even though its not enough time off).,"Overworked, terrible schedule (of which you have no say in), pay is far too low for the amount and type of work expected. Pay is also not location based which does not make any sense considering it is a fully-onsite role. There is ZERO ability for negotiation or discussions about pay raises at least from L1 - L4. Many issues with the promotion system. If you even want to get to L5 in HR, you must invent some problem and act the hell out of a pretend solution. I am not supposed to be an actor, I am supposed to be doing HR work. They don't accept great work and the obvious ability to perform at the next level. Not to mention the difference between HRP and HRBP (L5) is just that they attend reginal meetings presenting the data that you gave them... You also will not be promoted unless you manager is willing to vouch for you, so you will have to kiss-up to them and basically beg for a ""promo-doc"". They will make up reasons to say you are not ready, even if they have said over and over that they have no feedback for you and you are a superstar and the best on the team. Many people spend over a year in ""stretch roles"" where they are not given any extra pay or given a title increase but are doing the work of the next level. And they are still not guaranteed that promotion when time comes. Seen more than one get passed up for an outside hire. Absolute nonsense. If your in Sr. leadership and your building metrics are not the best more than a few times, they will fire you. Doesn't matter the reason why the metrics are not met. This on top of already terrible turnover rates mean I have had 3-4 HRBPs in 2 years and about 5 site leaders. This is not to mention the desk work makes you wan to jump off a cliff. Anyone can be hired as an associate and they will drive you crazy. The turnover rate is insane for T1s and they act like it's HR's fault for not having enough pizza parties and bingo days. This means there are always new people who have questions everyday. Associates will fight each other and do other nonsense that makes your job so much harder. The bigger the building the worse the problems, but at least they have more HR. Small buildings are ""at gearing ratio"" but there is too much work and the small HR teams cannot keep up. Ultimately, not worth the amount of hoops they make you jump through. I hear that the higher levels 5/6+ outside of the warehouse are much more reasonable. So, if you want to work for Amazon, come here to get your foot in the door with HR if you can handle the schedule and low pay in high COL areas (ie. no kids) then get a better position and boomerang back to in a few years. This will get you much more pay and a better position in way less time then the nonsense promotion system here.",HR Partner,Current Employee,,"Mar 4, 2023"

Although some view it as onerous, I think the transparency and clearness will make promotions more equitable overall. - In general, very easy to reach out to and talk to people from other teams. Most people are happy to help out or share their thoughts if you are stuck on a problem. - Very few meetings (although I've heard this can vary with team).","- Some benefits are below FAANG pears (e.g. 401k match has max contribution of 4% of base pay) - If working fully remote, can be hard to meet and make connections with other employees unless you set aside the time to connect virtually or visit an office at some regular cadence. - Experience is very team-dependent (can be seen as pro or con I suppose, need to make sure you like your team and manager before joining).

Most recently, they have decided to implement a 3-day per week mandatory return to office (RTO), which they have applied globally to all corporate employees. Many of us were hired with the expectation and understanding that we would be entirely remote, so many of us do not live within commuting distance to the offices we work in. The previous model, which has been extremely successful over the past three years, has allowed each team to make their remote vs office arrangements. This new mandate does not allow for that anymore, and they are simply expecting people to relocate to areas with significantly higher costs of living, and densely populated areas. There are insufficient desks for the number of people they expect to bring in, desks are not assigned or guaranteed, and there is little consideration given for the increased time and cost required for commuting into the office three days a week. The issue is less about requiring office attendance, and more about the lack of concrete data to support this decision (rather than anecdotes about ""culture"" or ""riffing""), and the lack of transparency.

I've made mistakes and the company doesn't hold it against me. I love working on a first class team.

You are empowered to be your own advocate by setting up guardrails for yourself that allow you to communicate effectively with others, allow you time to get what you need done, and to preserve your me/family time. - You get out what you put in. If you lean into your business partners' work, and make yourself a valued contributor beyond just legal advice, you really feel like you are part of the product team. For some lawyers, this is a cherry on top. For others, you can still maintain the separation of law and business so long as you develop mechanisms to make sure your business partners are providing you regular updates so that you do not miss important issues.","- Some days will stretch into 10-12 hour days. That said, I look forward to us going back to the office three days a week in May. I think that will help create some organic separation that can reduce the inadvertent increase in work days when sit in front of our computers at home all day. - No one is going to make sure you are fully onboarded. Some managers are better than others, but the reality is they are handling a full day's worth of work and trying to cover the workstreams that they hired you for as well.

You have to bite your tongue a lot of the time but that doesn't happen every day. It can be very frustrating when HR pushes AAs towards you for things out of your scope such as HR-related subjects that they're too lazy to deal with. Personally, at my facility, there's an HR rep who doesn't have the right personality for their job-it's almost like they're always greatly annoyed with having to interact with AAs everyday which is what they get paid to do. There's a lot of paperwork that you have to do every day and sometimes it can be overwhelming when your lobby is full and you're balancing multiple things on your plate. It can be hard to balance life and work because our team is small and there are only 5 shifts you could have.

466,5.0,Excellent for career growth,"My perspective coming from a well-established European engineering company, is that Amazon is at a completely different pace. There is no room for complacency and the rate of growth is astonishing. The leadership principles are not just a corporate statement, they really are the norm here. And they make you feel very empowered once you internalize them. If you are looking for professional growth and endless opportunities, this company is miles ahead than others I've known. Most importantly, you are compensated for what you do in a very data-driven way, there is no convoluted paths for promotion and the culture is almost of an almost utopian meritocracy.","Not a con per se, but I have known many people who are just looking for a 9-17 job, same same every day, a comfortable safe position in a giant company. This is not what Amazon is about. We want you to grow from day one. The company has a place for people of all walks of life, but you have to be ambitious, driven and willing to put the effort. Sometimes it is hard to be motivated by a greater purpose of the company. I would say that the best outcomes of Amazon to the world are by-products of its core services (setting a legitimate customer-oriented standard for corporations, promoting an engaging and inclusive work environment, enabling people to do more dignified jobs by automating trivial work, optimizing logistics and distribution of goods with technology, etc...).

You will not know how many packages you have to deliver in a day until you pull up into the warehouse to pick them up. This usually means you have no idea the number of hours you will pull in a day. You could be done in 5 or you are working 10-12 hours. You are basically on your own all day and if you are delivering in the city the headache of trying to get into buildings as well as walking several flights of stairs due to nonexistent or broken elevators is commonplace.

When the share price was going up (until 2021) it was a relatively lucrative employer to work for.","The entire compensation scheme is designed to underpay employees:

Base salary accounts for less than half of “target” compensation.
RSU grants don’t start to vest for 2 years. If you leave the company before then, for any reason whether voluntary or involuntary, they’re gone and go back into the company’s pocket.
Company assumes that RSUs will appreciate by 15% annually, and this assumption is used to justify granting fewer shares during compensation planning. When the stock fails to grow by 15% annually (including when it actually drops by 50%) the company will do absolutely nothing to even acknowledge the financial pain, let alone attempt to make you whole.
When stock is growing more than 15% annually, Amazon will deduct the excess growth from future RSU grants to ensure you don’t get paid “too much”. So much for rewarding high performance!

Add to that the opaque performance management process, the stack ranking (which they deny by hiding behind target percentages for various performance ratings) and the cut throat culture.

All tasks were timed. 1-2 minute breaks in-between tasks (bathroom, getting water) were not actually able to be taken if daily goal was to be reached (you could physically take the break but the task clock would be running). Several teammates worked off the clock on the down-low to actually meet their goals to avoid being penalized, further inaccurately supporting managements productivity expectations. Goals for productivity and sales would change with little notice. Many members of the team were put on coaching plans to improve how fast they could work, or fired for not being fast enough. The more like a computer you were, the better. - Went from flexible hourly schedule to schedule-bidding based on stack-ranking. Teammates who were needing supplementary income (due to our low pay) had to leave part-time evening jobs and work odd shift times, or quit. - No internal growth opportunities after 3+ years on the team. Limited growth opportunities to move to other teams in different job functions (team was ranked as L3 but considered corporate). - Limited yearly raise for top performers, no raise for cost of living adjustment. Essentially, a pay-cut in the final years due to rising inflation and cost of living in one of the nation's most expensive cities. No severance packages (these specific attributes apply to THIS team, not Amazon teams as a whole). - Lack of communication from upper management on program direction or changes.

Managers and their assistants constantly breathe down your neck, in other words, they micromanage everything you do until your mental health goes down the drain. 5. You're isolated in your workplace with nothing but your thoughts, which is mentally taxing, plus they don't allow you to wear earbuds while working. 6. With the long hours working physical labor you will probably break a couple of bones here and there just from the overall wear and tear you'll endure. 7. Safety is not a priority, chances are you can walk in there with weapons and seriously hurt someone with minimal repercussions, if they cared they would mitigate/eradicate these types of risks immediately.

777,2.0,Bashing my head against the wall,Easy to get in for first job if you meet the requirements (bachelors in anything) and can move to an available position. Autonomy over time off (even though its not enough time off).,"Overworked, terrible schedule (of which you have no say in), pay is far too low for the amount and type of work expected. Pay is also not location based which does not make any sense considering it is a fully-onsite role. There is ZERO ability for negotiation or discussions about pay raises at least from L1 - L4. Many issues with the promotion system. If you even want to get to L5 in HR, you must invent some problem and act the hell out of a pretend solution. I am not supposed to be an actor, I am supposed to be doing HR work. They don't accept great work and the obvious ability to perform at the next level. Not to mention the difference between HRP and HRBP (L5) is just that they attend reginal meetings presenting the data that you gave them... You also will not be promoted unless you manager is willing to vouch for you, so you will have to kiss-up to them and basically beg for a ""promo-doc"". They will make up reasons to say you are not ready, even if they have said over and over that they have no feedback for you and you are a superstar and the best on the team. Many people spend over a year in ""stretch roles"" where they are not given any extra pay or given a title increase but are doing the work of the next level. And they are still not guaranteed that promotion when time comes. Seen more than one get passed up for an outside hire. Absolute nonsense. If your in Sr. leadership and your building metrics are not the best more than a few times, they will fire you. Doesn't matter the reason why the metrics are not met. This on top of already terrible turnover rates mean I have had 3-4 HRBPs in 2 years and about 5 site leaders. This is not to mention the desk work makes you wan to jump off a cliff. Anyone can be hired as an associate and they will drive you crazy. The turnover rate is insane for T1s and they act like it's HR's fault for not having enough pizza parties and bingo days. This means there are always new people who have questions everyday. Associates will fight each other and do other nonsense that makes your job so much harder. The bigger the building the worse the problems, but at least they have more HR. Small buildings are ""at gearing ratio"" but there is too much work and the small HR teams cannot keep up. Ultimately, not worth the amount of hoops they make you jump through. I hear that the higher levels 5/6+ outside of the warehouse are much more reasonable. So, if you want to work for Amazon, come here to get your foot in the door with HR if you can handle the schedule and low pay in high COL areas (ie. no kids) then get a better position and boomerang back to in a few years. This will get you much more pay and a better position in way less time then the nonsense promotion system here.",HR Partner,Current Employee,,"Mar 4, 2023"

845,2.0,It Really Does Depend On Your Manager,"- If you have a good manager, Amazon can be a great experience. The times I had good managers, I was able to do great work and get the resources I needed. - Lots of resources for training, skill improvement, etc. - A very robust remote work system - obviously of only limited usefulness because they want people in the office three days a week, but on days when you do work outside your office, the system works incredibly well. It's even good enough that you can register your own laptop as an Amazon laptop and get it wiped when you're done. - The on-call process is surprisingly pleasant. Each team member takes a 1-week turn with on-call, and if your code is built so that breaking changes are difficult to get into prod (which most of them are), you will very rarely be paged after hours, if at all.","- If you _don't_ have a good manager (perhaps because they don't get you, don't respect your time, can't stand up to demanding PMs) then you will have an awful experience. And unfortunately, Amazon has enough internal reorgs that you really don't have control of who your manager is. - I couldn't help but feel like I was in a cult the whole time. The ""leadership principles"" feel like dogmatic recitations, they always insisted that you were the best due to their rigorous interview process (which honestly didn't feel nearly rigorous enough after seeing it from the inside), and it was nearly impossible to have any insight into what upper management thought, especially when it came to salary and performance reviews. - Lots of theater for code changes, especially new deployments.

1011,4.0,A Great Place to Work with Its Pros and Cons,"Amazon is a fantastic place to work if you appreciate a fast-paced and dynamic work environment. Teams and individuals are encouraged to quickly adapt to changing priorities, which can be a pro for some but may not be suitable for everyone. The ""Correction of Errors"" process helps eliminate the blame game that often occurs during outages at other companies. Working in networking at Amazon offers unique and challenging problems that are difficult to find elsewhere. NDEs (network development engineers) are given the opportunity to work on the problems that interest them, even if it means switching teams. The company has high hiring standards, which means you'll be surrounded by bright and diverse individuals.","The constant change of priorities can have negative side-effects. Your project might have its scope altered or even cancelled altogether. The company's organizational structure has changed every 3 years or so, and there's often a trade-off between long-term personal development and short-term goals. If you're interested in pursuing non-Amazon technical development or certifications, be prepared to invest personal time and money. The combined effect of these factors has made my experience disappointing. I've reported to seven different managers in my time with the company, which has made it difficult to advance. However, experiences at Amazon vary widely depending on your team and focus, and some teams are better than others. I strongly recommend vetting your manager and team thoroughly before accepting a position. Finally, the scale of Amazon requires teams to focus on a smaller part of the bigger picture, which can result in siloed teams and individuals. Some teams do a good job of balancing their narrow focus with a broader perspective, but this is not always the case, especially in networking.",Network Development Engineer,Current Employee,"Seattle, WA","Feb 9, 2023"

This caused me to go negative in hours and I received emails saying they would fire me soon. I pleaded with HR, who are two uneducated women who do not care about the employees and will make no attempt to help. All of my superiors knew it caused me pain to work and I was told “No” personally when asking for them to please help me by every level of superior I was able to talk to. I can’t use my right arm hardly at all now and I still can’t get a job. They made sure I swore it wasn’t them after I told them it was and then said they’d fire me and would not offer accommodations. ON TOP OF THIS, my login was immediately invalidated when I resigned, so I don’t have access to my W2. That’s right, they won’t even send me a physically copy and are denying access to the digital one because guess what? It’s not their problem.

The grass truly is greener at other sites.","When I started with Amazon, the principle ""You own your career"" was encouraging and motivating. Career opportunities are stunted by lack of shift rotation for proper exposure to the site leaders, and lack of experience level by managers that don't know how to recognize talent and Develop the Best. Req's are often filled before they are opened, and it has become about ""Who you know"" instead of what you have accomplished and what you have to contribute.

1216,1.0,Your just another brick in the wall.....the never ending wall.,"Flexibility with taking time off and changing schedules, partial stock purchase plan and decent benefits.","This place has a huge turnover due to the fact that management treats employees like numbers. In the first year the facility was open it went thru a little over 4000 employees. Some don't even make it thru the first shift. The place is literally ran like a high school although some days it feels more like kindergarten due the childish behavior of some managers. We have been working an extra day of mandatory overtime since October of 2022 due to a shortage of staff. As soon as one batch is hired another batch leaves. Mandatory overtime is called MET and sometimes it gets added to your schedule at the last minute. If there is bad weather like the ice storm we had a few weeks ago they wont close the facility even though surrounding cities and schools shut down. They said they would excuse peoples time but after the fact refused to do so and, in some cases ask for pictures to prove you could not get out of your neighborhood. Pretty petty childish behavior of them to cheat people out of their time like that. There is a lot of favoritism, bullying and intimidation by the managers. The few good managers we have don't stay long or get moved to another area. In the first year my area went thru about a dozen managers and the longest one stayed was about 5 months. He was a pretty good guy but the constant stress of the place drove him back to the facility he came from in Memphis. Our department just acquired a problem manager that was passed over to us by another department. She has already ran off several good people in our area and about half of our department is now looking for a job or a transfer to another facility. No one in the area wants to pick up shifts on her end of the week and work with her. She has bullied several employees with health issues and put them in dangerous situations. Forcing employees to work in situations that are not ergonomic and could cause injury. Forcing employees to do very physical indirect task that they may not be physically able to do or desire to do and were not hired to do. Don't let her see you talking to someone or she will question you about your conversation. Upper management refuses to get rid of her and just lets it go on. It's really sad because it could be a great place to work. The facility has been open about a year and a half and most of the original employees are long gone. The few of us who remain most likely will not be there much longer at the rate it is going.

-- Excellent training
-- Supporting groups abound

-- Highly competitive (you'll hear the term ""bar-raising"")
-- Work/Life balance: it's your responsibility to manage your time; and if you're not careful, you'll allow yourself to breech the boundary because you feel the need to be more competitive. Resist it in the sense of setting your own boundaries and then managing your time to them. Know when to say (politely), no. I rate this as a ""con,"" because many people don't know (or are afraid) to do that. Don't be. Just be consistent.
-- Anonymity -- If you're a Big Fish in a Small Pond today, you might not like Amazon, where there are likely several folks much like you.

I have worked at two different buildings in different networks within the company and both were extremely toxic. I have seen almost all of my work friends in this role leave as soon as they could, some even without having another job set up, just to get out of the company. And don't be fooled with their ""generous sign on bonus"" because it keeps you in the company for at least a year which essentially is the year from hell. Keep in mind you only get about 8 vacation days your first year and 10 after that which you find yourself having to use that time just to have a weekend off. 4.8 days of PTO is given in a year which is the only type of time allowed to be used during peak season which is October- January.

All tasks were timed. 1-2 minute breaks in-between tasks (bathroom, getting water) were not actually able to be taken if daily goal was to be reached (you could physically take the break but the task clock would be running). Several teammates worked off the clock on the down-low to actually meet their goals to avoid being penalized, further inaccurately supporting managements productivity expectations. Goals for productivity and sales would change with little notice. Many members of the team were put on coaching plans to improve how fast they could work, or fired for not being fast enough. The more like a computer you were, the better. - Went from flexible hourly schedule to schedule-bidding based on stack-ranking. Teammates who were needing supplementary income (due to our low pay) had to leave part-time evening jobs and work odd shift times, or quit. - No internal growth opportunities after 3+ years on the team. Limited growth opportunities to move to other teams in different job functions (team was ranked as L3 but considered corporate). - Limited yearly raise for top performers, no raise for cost of living adjustment. Essentially, a pay-cut in the final years due to rising inflation and cost of living in one of the nation's most expensive cities. No severance packages (these specific attributes apply to THIS team, not Amazon teams as a whole). - Lack of communication from upper management on program direction or changes.

The feeling I have is that the company is growing so much there is not enough qualified labor, so they just hire anyone. Then when they finally hire a good employee, they won't stay due to the total mess, disorganization and toxic environment. They treat their employees ruthlessly and they see them as numbers. People get fired for wrong reasons out of the blue and when the associate wants to explain why their termination was wrong, they don't give the right of appealing to everyone. Sometimes no one shows up for the appeal and they keep having to reschedule. The policies are outdated, that's WHEN they have at least a date so we can know which one is the most updated one. You ask dozens of employees from different departments for a simple answer and sometimes (very often to be honest) it is just impossible to find an answer. They say you should disagree and commit, but guess what happens when you give a manager feedback, even in the nicest way? They retaliate against you. One may say ""but they have a non-retaliation policy"". Do you know how hard it is to prove retaliatory behavior? They will do anything to protect management and the most you will get is ""oh, that is just their management style, we'll work on that"". If your manager works remotely, they will probably show up once a week or every other week for a half an hour discussion that is usually just a formality and no matter what you say, they are always too busy to follow up with your concerns. If you are an Amazonian that has ever tried to get HR support (especially if your building doesn't have an HR), you know how hard it can be to get your issue fixed.

1339,5.0,Great experience!,"I enjoyed my time at Amazon very much. If you like to work and keep in shape, it's a great job. The pay isn't bad, the VTO is pretty generous. And I loved the management team. It's a very manual job. I'm in my 40s and I was raised by hard working parents that taught me to respect my employment. At Amazon I worked alongside many lazy individuals that were on their cell phones most of the time and who bad mouthed the company. It's a warehouse job so it's very physical. If you want something more laid back, this will not be the job for you.",Amazon seriously needs to enforce a stricter drug policy. The people that get high at this place is ridiculous.

1343,3.0,"Great Team, Poor WLB",I really enjoy working with my specific team at Amazon. They're very fun and we have good camaraderie. Another thing I like about working at Amazon is that everything I do is something I'm trying for the first time. Work is usually not boring because there is always a new challenge to solve.,"At Amazon there is a belief that it is best to keep teams scrappy, and that this will contribute to the company's success because it will make people continue to invent and simplify. I personally have not found this policy to have this intended effect. One of the most immediate things I noticed working at Amazon is that the internal tooling is horrifically maintained, and makes most of your job like pushing a boulder uphill as method after method that you take to find a solution turns out to be a dead-end or not to be feasible because of some tech-debt quick hack that some other team or your team took that now limits the range of options you have available to you. I think this is due to customer obsession: everything that does not pertain to a customer-related launch is de-prioritized into obscurity. I feel also that there is a sense of willful blindness at the company, a curious double-think where work life balance is strongly encouraged, and all management is advocating for it, but the timelines that are set are so aggressive that they push developers to the limit and make it impossible to achieve. At its heart, I don't think this is an intentional blindness, rather I think it comes from the simple fact that technical unknowns tend to slow a project, not to speed it up, and high level management is working with more levels of uncertainty than lower level teams.",SDE-I,Current Employee,,"Jan 31, 2023"

If you have any type of issue you have no one to speak to. The warehouse will tell you to call support, support will tell you to email support, and email support will give you a copy and pasted reply from an email center across the world. Amazon owes me overtime from 2 different shifts, and they owe me for an entire shift that was cancelled at the warehouse due to weather. I still have not been paid because it's impossible to get ahold of anyone to actually help you. -You can spend more time on the shift than you committed to.

As far as work life balance goes, I always heard horror stories about employee burnout, but I am happy to say that hasn't been my experience at all, nor that of my colleagues and the people I work with.

I LOVE the collaborative environment that the company has established through its' culture, particularly when it comes to innovation, and having the ability to gain multiple perspectives while presenting your ideas, without all the bureaucracy you get exposed to in other companies. This is exactly why they're always at the top of the industry, they listen to the customer, and reinvent experiences using the feedback gathered. I can truly say, I am very happy to be working at Amazon.","The project/ resource management tools could be a bit better.

1594,5.0,HIGHLY Recommend for HR,"I HIGHLY recommend Amazon as an employer, particularly operating in the field, to fast track your career and enhance your career experience. Amazon is the only company I have experienced that TRULY lives their leadership principles- it is what your annual review, touch bases, promotions, terminations, projects, everything is based on. From these values, you will know exactly what a successful Amazonian looks like. Amazon enhances employees development by sending employees to launch sites or sites in need of additional help. They also have temporary teams built that you can take part of to learn to specialize, such as employee relations. They want to promote people quickly and from within as often as possible. If you want to try something and you can present a solid reason why, they are willing to invest in you. This is one of the best companies I have ever worked for. If you are willing to put in the work, you can triple your salary (or more with stock options) in 5 years. I was able to double mine in 2.5 years. Had I not wanted to own a business, I would have stayed with Amazon for much longer. If my business fails, I would go back to Amazon in a heartbeat.","I firmly believe you have to be in the right time of your life to support Amazon warehouses. I would not work at Amazon if I had a children and/or prioritized work/life balance (depending on your position- in this case HR manager (L6) or below). I would recommend it if you're single or a fresh college graduate. In the field (aka warehouses), you will work 55+ hours per work, can be responsible for any shift, and the PTO policy isn't great ( if you have a good boss they can make up for that). You will have a lot of managers at Amazon- some AMAZING and others TERRIBLE, there is no in between. If you want to promote FAST, you will have to relocate to support launches. That being said, you can still promote quickly in your location, but it will be faster in 1) a larger site (2000+ people) and/or 2) a geographical area saturated with sites (ex. southern California). It is a stressful job, but you will learn a lot in a VERY short period of time. When and if you are ready to leave the warehouses/field operations, there are so MANY opportunities and business lines to explore. I did this and found myself missing the grind of the warehouses immensely. Specifically for HR, I would try to join Amazon as an HRBP vs. HR Partner if you have experience in HR (2+ years). If you are new to HR and serious about a career in it, I would recommend starting as an HR partner and grinding away (keep in mind- this may require swing/night shifts). There are people that have been promoted 4-5 times in 5-7 years from a position like that. Overall, if you want to grind in your career (you could be VP status by 30 if you're lucky) and work/life balance isn't a priority- Amazon is a good fit for you. It's not a bad thing- it's just a fit for a certain type of person. --",Senior HRBP,Former Employe,,"Jan 6, 2023"

1606,5.0,"Exceptional Leadership, Innovative Culture","As a newer employee, I find the culture at Amazon encourages innovation with a commitment to customer obsession. This truly resonates in day-to-day work as the priority remains on exceptional experiences for Amazon customers (both internal and external). The guiding leadership principles set a strong foundation and clear expectation of responsibilities shared by the entire organization. I have found this consistency to be conducive to collaboration across teams. The company also empowers employees to act and think as leaders, which creates an environment in which teams are dedicated, strategic and accountable.","The nuances that make Amazon a ""peculiar"" place to work will likely be unfamiliar to non-Amazonians and take some time to adjust.

1607,5.0,Best company I've worked at,"Amazon can feel like a giant startup in many cases. The Day One mentality is very real here. You are given a very high level of ownership compared to other organizations. Previously I have only seen this at small companies but at Amazon, they will fully let you embrace your Bias for Action.
This can be a con if you are not careful as much of your ability to prioritize and manage your time is on you. It's part of how everyone is treated like a leader.
As far as work life balance is concerned, I haven't really had any issues there. Sometimes I do find there are days where I work a bit longer than usual but only because I'm genuinely interested in the problem.
I love how customer obsessed this company is as well. Everyone truly walks the walk when it comes to the Leadership Principals, with customer obsession being top of mind for everyone.
As far as growth is concerned, it's well known there are not a lot of levels in Amazon. This means a very flat organization so once you get to a certain level, taking on that next level will mean a massive jump in responsibility. Amazon does spends a lot of time investing in your personal growth as well, and not in the form of token ""watch this video and grow"". It's more like, I think you can improve here, let's send you to a workshop to level you up. It comes across that they truly want you to raise your own internal bar so you can be ready for that jump in responsibility.",First year PTO grant could be better.,Sa Manager,Current Employe,,"Aug 4, 2022"

I have worked shifts clear over 13 hours. They claim safety as a number one priority but scrutinize when operational efficiency is impacted due to rising safety concerns or new safety protocol. The company tends to be  not as competitive with their pay scale in certain areas due to their ability to continue to hire new associates instead of looking to retain their associates with higher financial compensation packages.

If you don't prioritize your job over everything else in your life, you'll be viewed as underperforming.

It wasn't unusual to hear managers brag about how their team was the first one to start work in the morning and the last to leave. * Extreme churn-and-burn with employees in many teams. People who want to do anything other than put in long hours for the company and step on their coworkers heads to advance their own career are quickly managed out. If you're a kind, decent person when you start a job here, then chances are you either won't last long or you will come out the other side a nasty jerk. * Not truly a tech company. Glaring on the retail side of things, where most teams are full time working on keeping systems that barely worked when they were built a decade ago running, while slowly replacing them with new systems that will be badly outdated when (if) they finally launch. Even in AWS, the retail ethos is pervasive, and product/business interests perpetually trump investments in innovation and reducing tech debt. * Specifically as a manager, the company is incredibly isolating and draining. You have no peers - every other manager is competition for funding, stack ranking slots, and promotions. A constant stream of toxic, anti-worker policies and demands filter down through you. You either have to be a ""good manager"" from Amazon's perspective and put enough gold paint on the turds you're handing out to convince your reports that they should be thankful for them, or be honest with your reports and paint a huge target on your own back. * Diversity and inclusion are FAR worse there than any other big tech company I've seen. Some managers/directors are good about this. But entire orgs in the Seattle HQ will be 90%+ people from mainland China or India.

-- Excellent training
-- Supporting groups abound
-- Narrative-focused problem solving","There are downsides at Amazon, but they tie back to what you aspire to do. Here are some:
-- Highly competitive (you'll hear the term ""bar-raising"")
-- Work/Life balance: it's your responsibility to manage your time; and if you're not careful, you'll allow yourself to breech the boundary because you feel the need to be more competitive. Resist it in the sense of setting your own boundaries and then managing your time to them. Know when to say (politely), no. I rate this as a ""con,"" because many people don't know (or are afraid) to do that. Don't be. Just be consistent.
-- Anonymity -- If you're a Big Fish in a Small Pond today, you might not like Amazon, where there are likely several folks much like you.

1997,3.0,"Pay is good, but don't hurt yourself",The pay and benefits are good and you can leave at any time as long as you don't use all your Paid Time Off and (PTO) and Unpaid Time Off (UPT). Which is pretty lenient.,"1. Using all your UPT will put you into problems with amazon and has a high chance of terminating you if you don't give a good reason for HR. 
2. Picking sounds easy, but at the warehouse, we worked at we had these drones that moved large quantities of items. the shelves both reached so high that you need to use a ladder and also puts items at your feet. requiring you to bend over. This puts a lot of strain on your back and knees. some days my knees would shake so bad at the end of a shift I struggled to walk. this problem is compounded because of #3.
3. The work culture constantly pushes you to work faster. They will tell you at day 1 that you will be fired if you don't move items at a fast enough pace. and management will come if your rates are low and tell you that. This stresses out the workers more with thoughts of needing to work faster or they might be terminated for being insufficient. It feels like a fairly toxic work environment if you ask me.
4. You will be treated as a replaceable tool and will be expected to be at your station every time your break is over. the warehouses are huge. this means you need to allot minutes of your breaks simply to walking.",Picker,Former Employee,,"Jun 26, 2022"

1999,5.0,I love working for Amazon--and I'm really not trying to leave but…,"Only thing that I can say—that's clear —is the Amazon internal structure was designed from the beginning to ""take care"" of its employees...and (pardon the pun) but, Amazon delivers. Pay is fair to excellent;  benefits are active from day one; there’s usually as much overtime as anyone would want, promotions, bonuses, access to stock purchases, paid training for extra certifications and qualifications etc. A day after working hard at Amazon is well felt when one arrives home to spend quiet evenings with loved ones.","Huge, huge company; sometimes Amazon feels unmanageable; cultures vary between facilities and regions. Work environment (behavioral culture) can lack esteem, pride and generally optimistic credence and/or proactivity. This is highly variable however--most facilities have a decent work culture but parts of Amazon are very transient due to the size of Amazon. Management is civil and required to exercise maturity when dealing with employees; regardless of other reviews the truth about Amazon is that the leadership (management cannot be abusive to employees under any circumstances; Amazon policy is to terminate abusive management or demote with impunity) however, management does play games ( and they know it) with other employees especially when earned promotions are due; promotions (that are due) may be obstructed and/or outright prevented usually in the name of exclusivity. 
Organizational cohesion is a real challenge at Amazon and very difficult to maintain due to the size of Amazon (however, it is not impossible to achieve and Amazon provides the necessary training to achieve it). While the next aspect is not overwhelming or prohibitive from enjoying working for amazon it is noticeable: sometimes Amazon's culture feels completely unmanageable and most internal employees will experience a feeling of being excluded a/o generally forgotten. Self sufficiency and autonomy of employees is requisite for all employees yet this is a tacit expectation that is not emphasized enough compared to the practicalities of the typical Amazon work environments. Amazon is actually not a company that will cooperate with employees who are exploring resignation options--meaning that if an employee is an established performer at Amazon and is considering changing jobs Amazon may actively obstruct the resignation in some manner.",Transportation Engineer,Current Employee,,"Jan 13, 2023"
