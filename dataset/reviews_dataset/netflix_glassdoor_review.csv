1,"- Paycheck
- So many good people
- Such a great service
- Hope","I have been working for a year at Netflix.

I've seen what was supposed to be very mature people, sharing absolutely almost no contact that anyone would qualify as ""human"".
Sure, that sounds hyperbolic, let me develop (and maybe cherry-pick a little).

Have you heard about our culture? The one about giving candid feedback? - I have seen people complaining of behavior they literally demonstrated themselves in the following days.
But I have also seen these feedbacks resulting in tears both in the eyes of HR persons or fellow engineers. How human does that sound?

Have you heard about our culture? The one about not tolerating brilliant jerks? I have nonetheless seen angriness and frustration, expressed in private, public and meeting. People rejecting new ideas by default, like, any ideas they wouldn't have worked themselves on for days wouldn't count. Even if those ideas are from the best examples in the industry or academics. How many publications/contributions have you seen from Netflix to computer science in general? How does it compare against any other company of that size in the Bay Area? Can you imagine either the real insecurity (x)or the lack of innovation that could lead to this situation?

Except for a few managers, directors or VPs feeling free enough to behave at work in the same way than how they live, almost every engineer I have been interacting with, have shared as little as possible about their private life.
The rare exceptions of interpersonal exchange ends up around some sort of competitive behavior: Who is the most geeky, sportive, owns the fastest car/biggest house/visited the strangest place.

I've heard workaholic people complaining about ambitious peers who were over-managing, over-working to get even more work to do after. I feel like we're past workaholism at this point.

Maybe there are a lot of shy people! Maybe there is a culture of fear, not only of being fired, but also a fear of interacting with people going to be fired.
Maybe it's all in my head, maybe people giving 5 stars to their experience here don't care the human aspect of a company. And maybe they're right.

What about your crush, your fears, your desires for the future, your appetite for life? I've been blessed to work in enough large companies to know that the behavior that I'm seeing in Netflix is not a healthy one. I've also been lucky enough to work in other industries more socializing than tech and I can tell that Netflix has a lot to do on that side, and off-sites or team meeting won't solve that problem.

I am afraid about the tragic, but inevitable consequences of the ways people operate in this company: I guess that the day the worst will happen, it will be addressed in an impersonal memo by Reed; followed-up by 1 or 2 reminders during offsites. Possibly commented by HR in a Q&A document. And move on. This company seems as reactive in its management of people as it is proactive in its business operations.

I still work at Netflix though, not only for the paycheck, but because I hope. I hope it will change. The needed change can't happen from a candid feedback, a Q&A, or  only from inside.
Change has to come from everyone, including people who take time to read comments like this one. Netflix has so many good people and offers such a great service.

As a curious Netflix employee reading this review: think about your past, isn't there a big human thing that you would love to feel again in your current company that you've felt in the past?

As a candidate: think about what would be a good question to ask to that HR partner once your package is almost here to be offered to you, think about that comment you make at the end of an interview when you're being asked by an engineer: ""Do you have any question for me?""
What Netflix needs is an inception, something that anyone and everyone would think about after leaving the call or the room they were sharing with you.
Ask yourself, and then the others, the question you should ask if you think you want to spend a good amount of your life and energy in the place you're applying for.

- Will I learn and contribute to the knowledge of other's? Even outside the company?
- Will I see emotional responses from my peers? Will that be for other reasons than being fired or bluntly criticized?
- Will I find a friendly environment that will nurture my appetite for life?
- What is the amount of emotional interaction (celebrating, sharing, playing) to expect from a company whose service is the best to ""entertain""?
- Do androids dream of electric sheep?",nil
2,"great benefits, best salary around, beautiful offices and you will work amongst some of the smartest folks you have ever met, plus you are talking about tv and movies all day - it's a FUN job","the company has grown rapidly over the last few years and during covid - the previous way of onboarding and building trust was much harder to achieve. I was at Netflix new many growth phases and this one is definitely the hardest - there are a ton of talent people in the marketing department that have been there a long time (e.g. more than 4 years) but not a lot of upward mobility so it feels like folks are getting restless. It has also become a much more political environment where it feels like leadership is most focused on decision making based on perception vs. what is best for the work and the teams. If you are a used to a political environment, this may not bother you.",nil
3,"Netflix is unlike any other company I've worked at. There's a level of trust that you don't see at other companies, and the people you work with all tend to be senior-level and very capable. Because of that, there hasn't been a hierarchy among IC's; everyone leads projects and functions as a trusting peer with everyone else. It's also always been a pretty lean company with process where it's needed but not the influence of politics and bureaucracy. But both of those are slowly changing, and I fear it will soon become like every other tech company. Another pro is that the compensation is 100% salary (no bonuses or forced RSU's), and thankfully that's not changing.","Inconsistency in management across the company, the addition of levels among ICs could hinder collaboration as not everyone will be equals and a hierarchy will be created, the possible introduction of a location-based salary adjustment is unjustified (output stays the same, the company saves money with so many working remotely). Internal communication has been horrible lately, which is sad and frustrating for a company that prides itself on being open and transparent.",nil
4,"The best part about Netflix is that they try to pay 20% more than everybody else, so the compensation is good.  They are not shy about spending money, so travel is business class, you'll get a new MacBook Pro every year, etc.  The people there tend to be very nice, the catered lunch is delicious, and so forth.  While there is still a lot of action in Los Gatos building the technology (although arguably it is becoming mature, as streaming is a commodity), the real drama is in Los Angeles, relating to content.","Netflix has very strange politics, because people's jobs are at the whim of their manager.  In other words, if a manager decides that a particular report is no longer a ""star,"" he or she will get a package.  So, given that employees are not stupid, there is a lot of kissing up, resulting in a lot of comedy.  Netflix believes in ""360 feedback,"" but everybody I know only does that to their peers, and they become very political with their management chain.",nil
5,"Pay is great, unfortunately, layoffs came for most of us. Depending on the team and manager, the work could be really fun.","General instability of the times. Can't really fault Netflix but maybe if they stopped putting in $$ for big-budget films that are formulaic and bad, that could have saved some of our jobs. There are some great shows on the platform but also a ton of crap. Who greenlights all these projects? It reminds me of that one Oprah meme, except someone on top is saying yes to every production deal that comes through its doors.",nil

Flexible schedules. Starting off you will be a Special Events Officer, and you choose as much or as little time and days you want to work.

Great for gaining security experience. If you are starting in the security field it is a good place to build time as a security officer if you want to further pursue other security opportunities.

The culture is very...ambiguous...similar to the bible people apply their own interpretation and there's no real system of accountability in place. Your manager can say keeping your camera off during a meeting is an example of ""poor judgment"" and use it to fire you. 

TLDR...it can be cut throat...if you get in take it all in cash and trust no one.",nil

The tech is your standard microservices architecture, and everything gets open-sourced, with a blog post and a nice conference talk. Eventually these projects wither because no one maintains them, and sometimes they don't even solve very effectively the problems they tout, but it's good PR for the engineers and 'leaders'.

Culture of fear is real. My manager was toxic, he loved to talk about diversity even though he was the biggest mansplainer in the room. My interview was interesting, it was a monologue of his rather unique theories of engineering management, most of which was a bunch of gibberish culled from the culture deck. When I got there I found him to be a pretty ineffective manager. He didn't have any engineering vision, no idea of strategy, and wasn't technical. If you get into an interview room and the manager spends 45 mins talking about himself, that's probably a sign to run!

Pick and choose what team you join. You can have either a pretty cool time with some smart folks, or have to deal with narcissists who believe their own PR.

2. Exciting company doing great things
3. Smart people","1. Definitely a culture of fear. People are let go constantly if they're not performing. The company is very open about this part of their culture, so just know what you're getting in to.
2. Company used to have a very strong culture (read their culture memo). That culture has evolved and, in the opinion of many people who've been there for a while, eroded. People regularly ignore key principles of the culture. Part of it is due to the company's rapid growth. Netflix with 8000 employees is very different from Netflix with 1000 employees 6-7 years ago. That level of rapid growth seriously diluted the culture.
3. Much less freedom & responsibility than in the past. Becoming more bureaucratic and political.
4. Much less forthright and candid from management. For example, management recently got rid of the 5% free options. Management framed it as more choice for employees (as the 5% free options were converted to cash salary, which employees can then allocate to options if they want), but as the comp philosophy of top of market typically didn't take into account the 5% free options, employees viewed this move as management disingenuously reducing salaries by 5%.

364,"- Pay. Unequivocally the best in town. Full stop. 
- Travel & Expense Policy. Nowhere else will you be allowed to effectively do whatever you want, with limited oversight and an occasional audit. Need to fly business? Book business. Need to stay in a swanky hotel. Stay in said swanky hotel. Just don't abuse it.
- Uber/Shuttles. Pre-Pandemic, of course, the company Uber account to/from work is a nice touch, though it's not great they add it to your taxable income without telling you about it. They also have shuttles all over LA to pick you up and drive you to and fro.
- Family Planning allowance. Real big high five for the $75k contribution to family planning, fertility, what have you.","- So. Many. Feelings. Good lord, be adults and do some actual work.
- Meeting-heavy culture. Every 30min chunk of your day will be full and you will get nothing done. Prepare to turn on and work late once you've eaten dinner or your kids go to bed. They know it and do nothing about it.
- Work life balance. You have no life anymore, there is only Netflix.
- Reorganizations are constant. If you want a comfortable existence in your role this is not the place for you.
- Leadership changes are constant. Since senior leadership does very little in the day to day work of building campaigns or managing talent, they make their hay moving people around the chess board like little pawns to justify their existence and politicking to get Ted's ear. It's gross, and the string of senior marketing departures validates its grossness. 
- Content is king. The Content Org that is. They can spend 20billion to make content, while Marketing panhandles on the side of the 101 for loose change to cut trailers, execute photo shoots, or do anything innovative. 
- Campaigns are teeny tiny. Unless you're a Ryan Reynolds movie, Stranger Things, or Bridgerton, you aren't getting a campaign; more a loose collection of assets geared toward keeping your talent happy. So if you're looking to build big, integrated, global campaigns, this likely isn't the place for you. Which is hard because...
- Ted promises talent a lot! So the Content and Marketing teams are between a rock and a hard place, as no one wants to tell them they aren't getting real campaigns, only token media spends and creative budgets.
- God help you if you work on a Season 2 or Sequel+. You're working with pocket lint and thoughts and prayers for resources. 
- The Culture. For a company famous for its Culture Deck, they've really let it fall by the wayside in most departments. Gone is critical, real time feedback. Gone is the pro sports team mentality. Gone is any real sense of Risk Taking or Innovation. It also is whatever anyone in Senior Leadership or HR says that it is to achieve whatever reorg or budget shortfall that's coming.
- There's no upward mobility and very little that goes into training/development. Raises are non-existent unless you go get an offer from elsewhere, in which case you're playing Russian Roulette with the ""Keeper Test."" 
- Redundancy. There are 6, maybe 7 departments that output creative? It's inefficient and it causes a ton of duplicative work.",nil

There constantly breathing down your neck and watching you looking for you to do something wrong. THeres little warning. Generally you get one. If your lucky or buddy buddy with with management or the supes you might get a bit more slack, maybe a lot more. If they dont like what they see they could be rid of you in less than a month and they openly joke about terminating people and about how expendable you are from day one. I read the reviews on here and went in and smellled the fish immediately. FIrst off they bring on a ton of people all the time for an amazing job so where do they end up. All of this is contingent on whether they decide if you are fit for production. You could be let go at the end of training and they dont give you any metrics on how that decision is made.",nil

- Interview process focused heavily on the culture which means you'll most likely work with the amazing people surrounding you.The environment encourages you to be a better version of yourself, which is far from the case in many places and often the opposite of that.","-if you are looking for a stable job for next 5-10 years and you are in your late 40th, and don't constantly want to learn something new and you want to work 9-5 if might not be a job for you.

Employees on your team are not afraid to give you feedback which is encouraged in the workplace. Whether you are an assistant giving feedback to a director or the other way around , everyone is more or else walking on egg shells. 

Very little training and everyone expects you to be a top performer. There is the expression “drinking from the fire hose” , literally blasting you with information everyday. I was expected to support a director running a 15 person team perfectly after 1 week of questionable training. 

Also the hiring process was deceiving - they promised a great role with salary which has different benefits than hourly employees , then proceeded to demand references including my employer at the time BEFORE sending me their offer. I had to basically announce I was leaving to my former boss of over 2 years (with no choice) before even having an offer letter and they then had the audacity to reduce my role and benefits to an hourly role with brief apology. I had to take it and was laid off 5 months later...",nil
