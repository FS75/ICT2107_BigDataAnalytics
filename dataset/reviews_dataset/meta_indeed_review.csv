5,Productive and fun workplace,"Senior Software Consultant (Former Employee) - Singapore - February 19, 2023","Good place to work. Lots of freedom to learn and explore things at work awesome perks and benefits, good compensation and work life balance, and a great culture for everyone to work at least once.",,
3,No Regrets,"Executive Assistant (Former Employee) - Austin, TX - March 7, 2023","Pros
- Decent WLB
- Opportunities for broader impact beyond core role
- Great internal training
- Competitive salary

Cons
- Performance reviews became highly political as the company grew",,
3,"Great People, Terrible Communication","Recruiting Coordinator (Former Employee) - Dallas, TX - March 3, 2023","I’ve worked on contract for Meta and I will say I loved my time working with my coworkers, but the actual work in crazy. I was let go early due to “performance”, yet we weren’t given any queues as to what standard it was supposed to stay at during meetings or 1:1’s. I was totally blindsided, and wronged after working insanely hard for this company",,
4,Young hardware comapny,"Optical Engineer (Former Employee) - Redmond, WA - February 28, 2023","I love the tech perks and the resources and ambition going into realizing the
""Metaverse"".

The downside is probably that it is a relatively young hardware company on a massive scale. There are plenty of people without actual experience of a product cycle.",,
3,"Productive, supportive team","Media operations analysts (Current Employee) - Mountain View, CA - February 21, 2023",Great working environment with great team members. I love how our team supports each other so that none of us fail and meet company’s expectations. Working here makes you want to work your best.,,
4,Fast Paced; metrics driven; collaborative environment,"Strategic Learning Program Manager (Former Employee) - Remote - February 21, 2023","Meta offers a fast-paced, metrics-driven work environment, ideal for individuals like me who thrive under pressure and enjoy working towards measurable goals. The collaborative aspect of the work culture highly values teamwork and effective communication. Meta is an exciting and dynamic workplace, especially if you enjoy a challenging work environment and value the opportunity to work alongside other talented professionals.",,
3,Used to be okay with the compensation,"Research Scientist (Current Employee) - Boston, MA - February 18, 2023","High wages, good benefits, that’s it.
Technical skills will degrade as you will be dealing with endless firefighting. The impact game is endless, pointless and solves no real problem.",,
2,Ehh,"Candidate Channels Specialist (Former Employee) - Remote - February 9, 2023","It was an okay job, just not very transparent when it comes to management. They don’t communicate well and like to act as though they are clueless when decisions are made.",,
4,Great place to work. Performance evaluation culture poisons engineering,"Software Engineer (Former Employee) - Menlo Park, CA - February 5, 2023","All in all, working at Meta is once of the best workplaces you can find outside of the job duties. One of the big issues is just the performance evaluation culture. Due to every engineer needing to fend for themselves to prove why they are still needed every 6 months, asinine projects are created and pushed through in the name of ""impact"" because there is very little central direction on what needs to get done.",,
4,"Not the same as a few years ago, but still a great place to work","Manager (Current Employee) - Remote - January 30, 2023","while the culture has changed over the last few years, Meta is still a great place to work. Mainly due to the people I work with, the benefits and the work life balance",,
3,Overall a good place - before the economy crashed,"Data Scientist (Former Employee) - Seattle, WA - January 30, 2023","Free snakes, free food and fast-paced work environment with great potential to grow your career. Recently being pretty toxic and ratting fighting so wait for a couple of years then go there",,
3,Awesome people...chaotic management,"Technical Program Manager (Former Employee) - Remote - January 25, 2023","Lots of amazing people work here. However, the culture is inconsistent across the organization and this certainly isn't the best place for women. There are no standards for management, so the possibility of having a manager that doesn't manage people well is there. There weren't any key objectives for my organization, creating a chaotic culture where everyone is achieving the do something big individually rather than working as a team or organization to move forward successfully.",,
3,"alright, not open","Software Engineer (Former Employee) - New York, NY - January 24, 2023",idk man. i was a new grad that got laid off before getting a team. internship experiences were good for the most part - supportive people and managers,,
4,"Constant change, demanding, great benefits.","Critical Facilities Engineer (Former Employee) - Prineville, OR - January 23, 2023","Review scheduled work, execute scheduled work, plan and revise to fit team availability.
I learned a great deal about data center operations.
Management of teams was varied based on the manager.
Maintenance system is in development and has a lot of opportunity.
The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the safety culture brought down from corporate.
The most enjoyable part was developing the team relationships while on shift.",,
2,Ambiente lavorativo ostico soprattutto da parte dei titolari,"demi chef de rang (Former Employee) - Milano, Lombardia - January 23, 2023",Colleghi ben disponibili ad insegnare ed a collaborare. Ambiente negativo per quanto riguarda la gestione da parte dei titolari e di altre figure all’interno dell’azienda.,,
4,Great People & Great Tech,"Manager (Current Employee) - Seattle, WA - January 21, 2023","Loved the work and believed in the direction we were going. People are friendly and most are mission focused.

Lots of current anxiety and uncertainty across all levels.",,
5,Great experience,"Content Editor (Current Employee) - Los Angeles, CA - January 11, 2023","Great team (literally only met one person who was semi-difficult to work with out of maybe 30). Great manager who doesn’t micromanage and shows genuine appreciation for my work. My ideas and contributions are respected, even as a contractor. I’m sure there’s exceptions, but overall I’ve seen a culture of gratitude and mutual respect at Meta- I should note that I’m fully WFH though, meaning my sense of Meta’s culture is only based on online/video interactions.

Still, lots of contractors are on the team and it doesn’t feel like they’re treated that differently other than not being able to go to the company All Hands, which is fair enough. There’s not much focus on your career growth as a contractor (but again, that’s literally what being a contractor is, and it comes with its own pros). Great pay. Great work/life balance for my particular role.",,
5,Excellent benefits and work envioronment,"Leadership Technical Recruiter (Former Employee) - Menlo Park, CA - January 5, 2023",Great benefits and perks along with compensation. Goals and bar is set high so you may feel the need to stretch yourself often but there is quite a bit of support from leadership.,,
2,Sinking ship,"Software Engineer (Current Employee) - Remote - January 3, 2023","Leadership is blaming ICs for the results of their poor direction. Pay and benefits are still good, but that's rapidly changing. Not a good outlook from here",,
4,yes,"costumer service (Current Employee) - teleperformance open - January 2, 2023","What if you could work with an international excellence team from the comfort of your own home? This is your opportunity! We are looking for Customer Service Representatives to work from home in a leading project.

4,Busy environment but worth it,"Facebook Gaming Content Creator (Current Employee) - Remote - December 23, 2022","Good pay , good starter career path. Poor communication through management. Alot of bugs within the software , and lack of leadership. But the pay is worth it.",,
5,Productive and fun workplace,"Senior Software Consultant (Former Employee) - Singapore - February 19, 2023","Good place to work. Lots of freedom to learn and explore things at work awesome perks and benefits, good compensation and work life balance, and a great culture for everyone to work at least once.",,
1,Fun,"TEAM LEADER (Current Employee) - Toronto, ON - December 16, 2022","Overall not a great company to work for if you want to advance your career. Most staff are unhappy with the way they’re treated
Wage increases are very minimal
It takes a long time to get a full time position",,
5,Rewarding and fun place to be,"Research Scientist Intern (Former Employee) - Menlo Park, CA - December 15, 2022","People are typically excellent at what they do. You may feel a little bit lost and intimidated by how independently everyone works and there is not much collaboration going on. The workplace is general is amazing, you get to meet very interesting and fun people, lots of activities to do on campus, many perks, good pay etc. Totally recommended.",,
5,Great benefits,"Controls Engineer (Former Employee) - Fremont, CA - December 14, 2022",Benefits are unmatched. You get 4 months of paid parental leave and 21 days of PTO per year. Culture is great and so is communication amongst team. Pay is top of the market,,
3,Big company and fast paced,"Software Engineer Intern (Former Employee) - Menlo Park, CA - December 12, 2022","It was really cool to work for Meta. As an intern, they really want you to learn quickly on your own. I’d recommend reaching out to people outside your team and reading internal resources to best help you deliver your project.",,
5,Wish it had been longer,"Technical Recruiter (Current Employee) - Remote - December 7, 2022","Great culture, time was cut short. I would choose them over again. Learned tons, was challenged daily. Recruiter across different teams. No micromanaging- if you are looking for autonomy you will find it here.",,
4,Great perks,"Program Manager (Former Employee) - Sunnyvale, CA - December 7, 2022",The company offers great perks if you know how to use them effectively. Culture used to be great. Everyone is just trying to climb the ladder and does not really care about the mission.,,
5,Productive and fun place to work,"UX Researcher (Current Employee) - Burlingame, CA - November 29, 2022","Challenging and productive! I would like to recommend people to work at Meta. Good support from the manager and colleagues!
Please check the location before accept the offer, normally they have buses too to help with the commute.",,
4,Exciting place to work,"Admin Specialist (Former Employee) - Austin, TX - November 29, 2022","There are a lot of moving parts at Meta with the focus shift to the metaverse.
Just be ready to navigate a significant change from a social advertising approach.",,
4,"Great culture, poor leadership","Senior Technical Recruiter (Current Employee) - Remote - November 25, 2022",Meta has some of the brightest individuals in the world and the people are truly the reason I have chosen to stay. The past year things have really gone downhill ana leadership has made poor decisions which have resulted in thousands of people getting laid off.,,
2,Competitive and inefficient,"People Research Scientist (Former Employee) - Remote - November 20, 2022",The performance review process leads to an emphasis on individual performance and competition amongst co-workers. The work done is often very low quality and lacking in rigor,,
4,"Fast paced, room for growth and complex","Growth Marketing Manager (Former Employee) - New York, NY - November 18, 2022","Working at Meta will expose you to a variety of functions and projects. It’s full of extremely smart people, which can be intimidating, but if you made it through the interview process you belong there! Best perks (free food, remote work, health benefits).

Cons: marketing tech platforms limit your capability to execute efficiently.",,
4,"Highly supportive, high performance culture","Recruiting Coordinator (Current Employee) - Seattle, WA - November 17, 2022","Great company to work for, especially at the start of your career. Very supportive leadership who genuinely want to see you grow and advance. Excellent benefits.",,
2,Burnout culture,"Senior UX Researcher (Current Employee) - Remote - November 13, 2022","They try to act like work-life balance is important, but people constantly feel the need to work while sick or dealing with intense emotional issues. Burnout is imminent for most people due to ""move fast"" culture that almost always is a dog whistle for working long hours to meet impossible and arbitrary goals.",,
4,"High Impact, Moves Fast","Creative Director (Former Employee) - Menlo Park, CA - November 5, 2022","Meta is a challenging, but stimulating place to work. Some of the toughest problems and the most creative people you’ll find in this work space. Quick pivots require you to stay agile and engaged.",,

3,"Brutal, but they pay you well for the effort","People Operations (Former Employee) - Remote - October 10, 2022","It's a wonderful place to work if you want to be continuously scrutinized from every single cross functional partner you have. They say feedback is a gift, but then won't give it to you, but will only tell on you to your manager. It's a brutal place to work, but they pay you well for the effort and treat you like royalty until they no longer have a need for you. When they decide your days are numbered, it's over before you know it. Take the job, take the money, but plan well, so when it all goes away, you're still ok while you look for another job.",,
1,not a friendly culture,"Technical Writer/Business Analyst (Former Employee) - Remote - September 26, 2022","Was told not to say hello to the people I was working with. Fired for a meeting when the manager was late and they said it was me. Wasn't given a chance to discuss and it wasn't even brought to my attention. Since I wasn't late, I waited for the SME. The one I needed the most in Ireland didn't show up for the meeting.",,
5,Fast paced but excellent career opportunity,"UX Researcher (Current Employee) - San Francisco, CA - September 14, 2022","If you get in and stay in, you’re in FANG, and will never have to hunt hard for a job again because you’re foot’s in the door of Big Tech. Open and transparent culture, top tier benefits, creating the future of the internet (Metaverse), they say people
may not like Facebook but they love working for Facebook. Recommend!",,
1,Not for mid career,"Analyst (Current Employee) - Remote - September 10, 2022","Very young company and cliques. If you’re likable then your good. If you’re not a kiss up and just want to do your job, then keep searching. We need diversity inclusion in a MAJOR way.",,
2,"Good perks, bad culture","Program Manager (Current Employee) - Seattle, WA - August 10, 2022",At first I could not figure out why anyone would leave- perks and comp are great. Then I realized that they have to be good to make up for the work environment. Leadership micromanages. Employees act as if they are entitled to tons of benefits.,,
5,Productive and fun workplace,"Senior Software Consultant (Former Employee) - Singapore - February 19, 2023","Good place to work. Lots of freedom to learn and explore things at work awesome perks and benefits, good compensation and work life balance, and a great culture for everyone to work at least once.",,
4,Fun place to work,"EE Collab Tech. (Current Employee) - Austin, TX - June 14, 2022","The office environment is unlike any I've experienced before. Great socials, and event's, collaborative work space, and great location.

The advancement could use some work, as you can get pigeonholed onto a team, but other than that I look forward to coming to work everyday.","Free food and snacks, fun office, awesome culture","Not alot of advancement, lack of cost of living wage increase"
1,Worst place to work,"Senior Systems Executive (Current Employee) - Austin, TX - June 5, 2022","They have micromanagement policy where lead is over you 24/7, the company is not organized a lot of unprofessional employees , you’ll work at Facebook which is good to put on resume and they’ll feed you Lunch , you won’t learn anything advanced as all internal tools are only accessible by META employees, the job doesn’t have flexibility to employees, salary is low compared to other same tech positions on the market, if you are looking to get familiar with technology Facebook uses then good but carrier advancing is impossible, there is not much to learn from",,
4,Meta,"Senior Manager (Current Employee) - Austin, TX - March 13, 2022",It's OK. Recently badly hit and the stock plummeted 20%. it will take a while for it to recover. PR issues every other month makes things exhausting. Everyone works crazy hours. Management is getting flexible with remote options... but they are cutting benefits ruthlessly. The best days of this company are over.,,
5,Yes,"Translator (Current Employee) - California - March 5, 2022","very good company, great support, great pay, they have their own tools to support the work, nice people, very on time. The manager is very nice. Everything is great",,
3,Stressful place to work,"Marketing Manager (Current Employee) - London, Greater London - February 26, 2022","Overall a very bad experience. Working long hours, over worked. Lack of job description understanding across the wider marketing team. Career progression is limited.",,
1,"Stressful, depressing workplace with no future","Equipment Engineer (Current Employee) - Redmond, WA - February 23, 2022","Toxic, micromanaging managers and young, depressed kids who stay in the job because the money is good but they see no future. No energy or drive to succeed; just follow the procedure, get the work done and go home. No direction on projects; just people scrambling for quick impact for their next PSC. FTEs are never on site because of lax COVID work rules so it's all contractors pretending they are running everything. Lack of concern for worker safety as shown by recurring complaints and a few worker injuries. Best to just stay away from this place. You're not making the future; you're just helping useless managers scam lots of money for themselves with their lies and deceit.",,
5,Collaborative company that looks after its people,"Learning Partner (Current Employee) - Dublin, County Dublin - February 13, 2022",Meta cares deeply for its people. We get amazing benefits and even our performance reviews include questions around how we helped build community within the company.,,
1,Bad employer,"Klantadviseur (Current Employee) - N.v.t. - February 11, 2022","Very high stesslevel, bad management style.",,
5,Special company,"Software Engineer (Current Employee) - Menlo Park, CA - February 1, 2022",Meta/Facebook is a great company to work. The media narrative is pretty biased in my opinion. People really care about their work and impact on the world.,,
5,Good comp and benefits,"Software Engineer (Current Employee) - Seattle, WA - February 1, 2022","The comp and benefits are definitely better than smaller tech companies. Sometimes the projects we work on seem to be quite small, and we are just trying to move metrics a little bit.",,
3,Productive and fun place.,"PM (Current Employee) - Fremont, CA - January 28, 2022","Lots to keep you busy by, always something going on. With covid, it's been difficult to maintain contact with people so they really go the extra mile to make you feel included.",,
3,"Much to love, much that needs improvement","Marketing Manager (Former Employee) - Seattle, WA - January 11, 2022","Pros:
Employee centric, many resources and tools provided for managers, efforts to be inclusive and show care demonstrated daily, very supportive during COVID

Cons:
Constant org changes, everything is P0 without any thought to impact over activity, constant duplication of work across individuals and teams, instead of considering what needs to be solved for in terms of impact, money or headcount is immediately thrown at problems essentially making them more complicated.

Opportunities:

Slow down to speed up, do not reward toxic behavior from leaders, while also realizing that some people need to be managed out for teams or orgs to continue to function healthily.",,
4,Good place if you find your place,"Software Engineer (Current Employee) - Menlo Park, CA - January 8, 2022","Facebook (aka Meta) is a great place to work if you want stability. Sometimes you have to grapple with its public image but if you find the right time, you can be fulfilled.",,
5,Great place to work.,"Sales Assistant (Current Employee) - Montréal, QC - December 9, 2021",Great place to work with lots of learning opportunities and career paths. Colleagues are very open to helping and teaching. Good work-life balance and benefits.,,
5,Excellent culture and company mission,"Researcher (Current Employee) - Menlo Park, CA - November 18, 2021","Company culture encourages innovation, creativity, curiosity, and the pursuit of one's own personal development goals.

Truly an outstanding company culture that embraces diversity, equity, and inclusion.",,
4,Consulting company and most of the time I was the only employee.,"Business Consultant (Former Employee) - Knoxville, TN - January 31, 2020","We performed excellently on projects. The problem is that this kind of consulting is not in high demand in the Knoxville area. This operation is an extension of my work in Los Angeles, CA where the demand was high.",,
