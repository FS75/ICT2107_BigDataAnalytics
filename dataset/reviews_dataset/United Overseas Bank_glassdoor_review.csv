18,1.0,"Bad culture, Not recommended",Good benefits and decent amount of good colleagues,"Pay wise is nowhere as high as European/US banks. Few things to highlights in the technology side: 1) If you're unlucky, you’ll get an old-timer manager who micromanaging a lot and scrutinizes unnecessarily instead of growing the team. 2) Always ask for process improvement including presentation of how other banks (if you’re from another) do things but never accept different perspective. Almost waste of time presenting. 3) They do catch up to other banks like DBS in terms of customer facing applications but lack of centralize systems for internal use. Very behind that of DBS and still using excel like a database. Excel is only as updated as someone willing to update it not a live info. 4) Brought in new technologies to play catch up but always stuck in one or two team because every team is so silo and there’s a lack of direction to cascade to every division. 5) A lot of old timers who doesn’t understand the importance of collaboration between teams. Full of back-stabbing instead. 6) A lot of long working hours in various teams can be reduced significantly if automation is in place. The problem is many people lack exposure on how things are automated in more advance banks, and they think that they must work this long to complete it. 7) Some old managers so call “know-it-all” mindset is actually “know nothing” in European/US banks or even DBS. These people doesn’t even have a Linkedin profile or understand how the modern management works. The list could go on but these are the key problems.",AVP-IT,Current Employee,Singapore,"Dec 29, 2022"

*Proper documentation and workflow. Everything here is so coordinated. They even user JIRA to log any issues or request and the business team also abide this.","*Dog eat dog world. Let me give you an example. The PMs don't care if you're doing improper testing. All they care is you sign the signoff form so one misstep and it's going to come back to haunt you later hence the need of this ""dog eat dog"" mindset else you get trampled

*No work-life balance. Yes, 100% agree. You are expected to work long hour sometimes till 10PM. Even weekends if need be including Sunday. At least in my previous workplace, Sunday is a sacred rest day.

*One bank concept. UOB is unique in a sense even with their overseas branches, they still consider them as one UOB. Everything is centralized. Development has to be coordinated and done with UOB Singapore. While in theory it's good, the reality is not. It's bureaucratic nightmare. Most of the time, you have to liaise between in-country team and Singapore team during testing.

220,1.0,"People need to feel that their work matters, by accurately evaluating their performance.",Being in a small branch means you can be part of a close knit community.,"1. Actual work does not roll up or reflect in KPI/OKR. In branch operations, about 60-70% of the time is devoted to handling day to day transactions and customer requests which means a lot of paperwork(I will get to that later). The scores that’s reviewed at the end of each month/quarter/year only covers 20% of the work that was done, but has an overall weightage of 80% of the total performance of an employee. That 20% is: up-selling/cross-selling of loans/cards/...and wait for it... Personal Internet Banking. 

2. Company direction not aligned with overall company focus. Overall, UOB wants to be a tech savvy financial institution and in Group Channels, it manifested mostly as “selling Personal Internet Banking”. This placed most of the responsibility on the branch employees to find ways to up their numbers. Some by resorting to cancel active account and sign these users up a second time. A better option would be to look at the time consuming and paper dependent workflows that all customers are required whenever they step into a branch. I presume things are much better now but back in 2015, everything had to be filled in pen and paper, and one spelling mistake or bad handwriting would be your worst nightmare.

3. People managers not equipped with the right skills. This may not be applicable to all branches, but in the particular branch I worked for, the manager was promoted simply because she was superb at sales. She failed miserably at people management and thus made everyday miserable for everyone and herself. Looking back, I wouldn’t say she was intentionally breathing down everyone’s neck or manipulating people to control them, but I think these are the methods that she was aware of/exposed to. Another reason could be that people’s welfare or overall satisfaction with their managers were not measured, and thus does not contribute to her overall performance review. Without this feedback channel in place, managers are not getting the right help to help their employees.

4. Too much importance placed on frivolous activities. This is purely my personal opinion and may be very skewed given the environment I was in. The channels group often had completions for cheerleading, dancing and other performance which are affectionately named “CCAs”. I understand the well meaning - to build relationships between branches and to promote life outside work- but it clearly has backfired when people started realising this is the only way to climb the ladder quickly (and not by doing a good job at work).  Also it’s almost impossible to feel that you have a balanced grasp of your life and work when there is a ton of paperwork piling at the branch, while your manager is calling you to go down for dance/cheerleading practice. Good intentions, bad execution.

5. Lastly, I just HAVE to add, the fake surveys. How UOB measures customer satisfaction is pretty intriguing. Every month employees will collect feedback forms from the walk-in customers. Given that this is a hard target and you have to have at least 2 per month (or you will be deemed as incompetent and disqualified for the Quality Awards), not all of the feedback forms were actually filled by actual customers. Most were signed my gullible and unknowing customers, and then later filled in by the employees themselves. Some were written by actual customers of course, maybe 10% of all submission. Again, another good intention scheme, execution gone wrong.",Service Manager,Former Employe,Singapore,"Apr 26, 2018"
