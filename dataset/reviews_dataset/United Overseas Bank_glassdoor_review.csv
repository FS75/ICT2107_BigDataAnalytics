19,1.0,"Bad culture, Not recommended",Good benefits and decent amount of good colleagues,"Pay wise is nowhere as high as European/US banks. Few things to highlights in the technology side: 1) If you're unlucky, you’ll get an old-timer manager who micromanaging a lot and scrutinizes unnecessarily instead of growing the team. 2) Always ask for process improvement including presentation of how other banks (if you’re from another) do things but never accept different perspective. Almost waste of time presenting. 3) They do catch up to other banks like DBS in terms of customer facing applications but lack of centralize systems for internal use. Very behind that of DBS and still using excel like a database. Excel is only as updated as someone willing to update it not a live info. 4) Brought in new technologies to play catch up but always stuck in one or two team because every team is so silo and there’s a lack of direction to cascade to every division. 5) A lot of old timers who doesn’t understand the importance of collaboration between teams. Full of back-stabbing instead. 6) A lot of long working hours in various teams can be reduced significantly if automation is in place. The problem is many people lack exposure on how things are automated in more advance banks, and they think that they must work this long to complete it. 7) Some old managers so call “know-it-all” mindset is actually “know nothing” in European/US banks or even DBS.

You already have a bad rep all over when people hear you are from UOB. Too many bad experiences by customers. So expect just to be used by low class client to waive their credit card fees which itself is a pain. 
And can you believe a bank that makes billions actually still expect us to fax documents?! LOL
Client once told me ""UOB is very transactional"". Which I have to agree that is the culture inside also. Stealing of clients is rampant and superiors don't care as long as the client is generating revenue for the bank, they don't care who transact so everyone will poach your client by undercutting you.

Your life is based around roadshows and what they call ""ATM Tagging"" where you stand by the ATMs to harass customers withdrawing their cash to mislead them into signing a suboptimal endowment insurance policy with you. You work 6 days a week from 0930-2100 or 1100-2100 HRS.

The workplace has a toxic work culture and classes bosses who could barely speak proper English. They recently implemented a $5000 bond on all Personal Banking Associates who decide to leave the job within 9 months instead of resolving why they have such high turnover rates. I strongly recommend against working at UOB as a Personal Banker unless you want to experience what it is like to be bossed around like a slave with bosses who can't even communicate properly.

It isn't difficult to guess what happen when they go on leave or are not the best person to get along with. It isn't exaggerating that 50% of your time is spending doing these unnecessary work.

1520,1.0,"People need to feel that their work matters, by accurately evaluating their performance.",Being in a small branch means you can be part of a close knit community.,"1. Actual work does not roll up or reflect in KPI/OKR. In branch operations, about 60-70% of the time is devoted to handling day to day transactions and customer requests which means a lot of paperwork(I will get to that later). The scores that’s reviewed at the end of each month/quarter/year only covers 20% of the work that was done, but has an overall weightage of 80% of the total performance of an employee. That 20% is: up-selling/cross-selling of loans/cards/...and wait for it... Personal Internet Banking. 

2. Company direction not aligned with overall company focus. Overall, UOB wants to be a tech savvy financial institution and in Group Channels, it manifested mostly as “selling Personal Internet Banking”. This placed most of the responsibility on the branch employees to find ways to up their numbers. Some by resorting to cancel active account and sign these users up a second time. A better option would be to look at the time consuming and paper dependent workflows that all customers are required whenever they step into a branch. I presume things are much better now but back in 2015, everything had to be filled in pen and paper, and one spelling mistake or bad handwriting would be your worst nightmare.

3. People managers not equipped with the right skills. This may not be applicable to all branches, but in the particular branch I worked for, the manager was promoted simply because she was superb at sales. She failed miserably at people management and thus made everyday miserable for everyone and herself. Looking back, I wouldn’t say she was intentionally breathing down everyone’s neck or manipulating people to control them, but I think these are the methods that she was aware of/exposed to. Another reason could be that people’s welfare or overall satisfaction with their managers were not measured, and thus does not contribute to her overall performance review. Without this feedback channel in place, managers are not getting the right help to help their employees.

4. Too much importance placed on frivolous activities. This is purely my personal opinion and may be very skewed given the environment I was in. The channels group often had completions for cheerleading, dancing and other performance which are affectionately named “CCAs”. I understand the well meaning - to build relationships between branches and to promote life outside work- but it clearly has backfired when people started realising this is the only way to climb the ladder quickly (and not by doing a good job at work).  Also it’s almost impossible to feel that you have a balanced grasp of your life and work when there is a ton of paperwork piling at the branch, while your manager is calling you to go down for dance/cheerleading practice. Good intentions, bad execution.

5. Lastly, I just HAVE to add, the fake surveys. How UOB measures customer satisfaction is pretty intriguing. Every month employees will collect feedback forms from the walk-in customers. Given that this is a hard target and you have to have at least 2 per month (or you will be deemed as incompetent and disqualified for the Quality Awards), not all of the feedback forms were actually filled by actual customers. Most were signed my gullible and unknowing customers, and then later filled in by the employees themselves. Some were written by actual customers of course, maybe 10% of all submission. Again, another good intention scheme, execution gone wrong.",Service Manager,Former Employe,"Los Angeles, CA","Apr 26, 2018"

1686,1.0,"People need to feel that their work matters, by accurately evaluating their performance.",Being in a small branch means you can be part of a close knit community.,"1. Actual work does not roll up or reflect in KPI/OKR. In branch operations, about 60-70% of the time is devoted to handling day to day transactions and customer requests which means a lot of paperwork(I will get to that later). The scores that’s reviewed at the end of each month/quarter/year only covers 20% of the work that was done, but has an overall weightage of 80% of the total performance of an employee. That 20% is: up-selling/cross-selling of loans/cards/...and wait for it... Personal Internet Banking. 

2. Company direction not aligned with overall company focus. Overall, UOB wants to be a tech savvy financial institution and in Group Channels, it manifested mostly as “selling Personal Internet Banking”. This placed most of the responsibility on the branch employees to find ways to up their numbers. Some by resorting to cancel active account and sign these users up a second time. A better option would be to look at the time consuming and paper dependent workflows that all customers are required whenever they step into a branch. I presume things are much better now but back in 2015, everything had to be filled in pen and paper, and one spelling mistake or bad handwriting would be your worst nightmare.

3. People managers not equipped with the right skills. This may not be applicable to all branches, but in the particular branch I worked for, the manager was promoted simply because she was superb at sales. She failed miserably at people management and thus made everyday miserable for everyone and herself. Looking back, I wouldn’t say she was intentionally breathing down everyone’s neck or manipulating people to control them, but I think these are the methods that she was aware of/exposed to. Another reason could be that people’s welfare or overall satisfaction with their managers were not measured, and thus does not contribute to her overall performance review. Without this feedback channel in place, managers are not getting the right help to help their employees.

4. Too much importance placed on frivolous activities. This is purely my personal opinion and may be very skewed given the environment I was in. The channels group often had completions for cheerleading, dancing and other performance which are affectionately named “CCAs”. I understand the well meaning - to build relationships between branches and to promote life outside work- but it clearly has backfired when people started realising this is the only way to climb the ladder quickly (and not by doing a good job at work).  Also it’s almost impossible to feel that you have a balanced grasp of your life and work when there is a ton of paperwork piling at the branch, while your manager is calling you to go down for dance/cheerleading practice. Good intentions, bad execution.

5. Lastly, I just HAVE to add, the fake surveys. How UOB measures customer satisfaction is pretty intriguing. Every month employees will collect feedback forms from the walk-in customers. Given that this is a hard target and you have to have at least 2 per month (or you will be deemed as incompetent and disqualified for the Quality Awards), not all of the feedback forms were actually filled by actual customers. Most were signed my gullible and unknowing customers, and then later filled in by the employees themselves. Some were written by actual customers of course, maybe 10% of all submission. Again, another good intention scheme, execution gone wrong.",Service Manager,Former Employe,Singapore,"Apr 26, 2018"
