2,2.0,average experience with shady staff members,location: it was close to home,"shift timing: it was based on an 8-hour work shift so morning (8am-4pm). afternoon (12pm-8pm), and evening (3pm-11pm). Plus, we only had one day off per week which was insane for a part-time job and the contract was three months long but many left the job after a week. Racial discrimination: on the first day, I met my colleagues who were Malay. Our supervisor was a Chinese middle-aged woman and she assigned them to the temperature screening station (which was literally our job scope) and separated me from the rest. She spoke to me in mandarin and asked me if I was Chinese (I'm Indonesian Chinese) and then said that I should do work that can benefit me and gain some skills along the way, implying that the temp screening job was for no-brainers. My new job was at the self-check-out counter where she ensured me that I could work my way up to cashiering but it was not what I wanted. Plus, when they took me off of that station (because I was underage and couldn't sell people alcohol, cigs, etc. = inconvenient), the Chinese ladies at that station were denigrating me and mocked my situation. Really fun working environment! Anyways, I hated that job and the environment. Left after a month because I needed cash.",Part Time Temperature Screener,Former Employee,"Choa Chu Kang New Town, ","Feb 19, 2023"

124,1.0,Horrible Treatment,I really wish I can have something to say about this.,"Too many. (I am being very serious about this matter)

I would like to share my part-time experience at Fairprice Ang Mo Kio Branch. This is actually to elaborate on the mistreatment of part time staff behind closed doors.
So, I actually was hired through a recruitment agency online. The advertisement for the part time job, states the timing to be 7am to 3pm / 3pm to 10pm. The job description was “Event / Roadshow Helper”. Prior to accepting the job, I called up the agent to understand more. I specifically mentioned that I will not want a cashiering job, because I am not experienced and that I do not wish to make compensation for any cashiering mistakes. The agent told me that the event helper will probably have some light cashiering on the roadshow area, or/and some stock-up items on rack at the roadshow area. With that, I accepted the offer.
On the first day of work, I was assigned to a full-on cashiering job at the main counter (not that of the roadshow area). The part timers were told that, we are supposed to come at least 15 minutes earlier to count our float money and get briefing, which will not be payable. The shift starts from 9am to 5pm (not as per the advertiment post) with a break time of 45 minutes starting at 3pm. We are all blamed rudely for not preparing our own pen for work, despite there was no prior instruction. I believe that if the stationery is needed for work, it should be provided by the company. I was assigned under a senior cashier. We both went to one main counter, and the queue never stopped. None of us part -timers were given any prior cashiering training. So, we are tagged to a senior cashier for the first day to learn as we work. 
There are actually many promotional items that needed to be memorised and it is not automated inside the scanning system or printed in hardcopies for cashier to remember. So, any mistake made, or shortage of cash beyond $5, will be payable by the cashier.
During my lunch break, I was instructed to go into the office with the cashbox after logging off. I was told to count my money and make necessary calculations to prepare for the float amount for tomorrow. The float amount should total up to $600, but, it has to consist very specifically how many numbers of $10 notes, $5 notes, $2 notes and so on, coins included. So, it took around 10 minutes to count, and we have to do it because 3pm is one of the timeslot to make exchanges with the chief cashiers. We also have to queue up at the chief cashier counter to exchange our money at 3pm. So, if you can imagined, every cashier who have a lunch break at 3pm, will be waiting in queue to make necessary exchanges. This will take up around 5 minutes. We are told to be back 10 minutes earlier for our break. Hence, the real break time is around 20 minutes. That is not quite sufficient to buy a proper meal and consume. We are also instructed by the chief cashiers to not pack any food into the office. There is no self-initiative on my end that I can make this break time situation better.

The chief cashiers are extremely rude to part-timers and also the senior staff as well. They are bullies. They exercise their ranks to intimate those who report to them, and they never teach us anything. They held the seniors responsible for all the part-timers despite it is their manpower management issue to begin with. The senior I was assigned to is a responsible, hardworking staff who worked for many years. But, it is unreasonable to expect her to coach me efficiently if the queue is never stopping. And, I was only “coach” for one day, and I was on my own the second day.

Every morning, the chief cashiers will brief the cashiers in a rush. They will show many promotional items over a small computer screen. They will not be printing any hardcopies of these items for the cashiers. They will warn every cashier that, it is our responsibilities to memorise these items. Specifically, one chief cashier warned us not to ring the bell to ask her for help (despite this is part of her job to assist the cashiers at the counter should it be necessary). She warned us that we have to bear the consequences of any mistakes for these promotional items. It is nearing Hari Raya and the items are easily more than 40-50 products on different sales packages / discounts / promotional cards / date duration of items. There is no way a person can remember all these details in a short briefing of less than 5-minutes. The chief cashier also shouts rudely many times at part-timers and full-timers, exercising a bullying culture across the whole department. For example, on one cashier briefing, the chief cashier asked if any cashier was not on duty yesterday, and my senior was signalling to me that I need to tell her I was not on duty yesterday, and the chief cashier shouted at my senior (who is a good and responsible staff, and has worked for over 7 years), “KEEP QUIET!”. This is unacceptable, and no human being should be treated in this manner. Even if a person makes a mistake, this is still not how a managing personnel should be dealing with it.
The chief cashiers are extremely rude to the staff. They will shout and scold us for every little mistake or if they simply feel so. For example, I was serving a customer at the counter, and when there is a specific music that plays at over the speaker at fixed timings, it is actually a signal for counter cashiers to wipe the counter tops. So, the chief cashier was waiting impatiently for me to make that cleaning so she can snap a photo. My senior whispered to me to clean the counter, so I took the cloth and wipe for the chief casher to snap the photo. The chief cashier immediately walked over and scolded me in front of the customer saying that I should serve him first. I am very confused why I was scolded. I simply followed the instructions. Then, right after, I took the cloth and wipe, but I need to know if she has snapped the photo. So I looked up, and she shouted again, “WIPE! Do not look up at me!” 
On the second day, I was on my own at a cashier counter. I was barely trained. The queue never stopped. My agent told me I cannot get my salary if I did not serve my notice, but I have still decided to go because there is a very high chance I would make a mistake with all the promotional items, which will be bearable by my own pocket. Despite voicing out to the manager that I wanted to change to a jobscope, the request was rejected at the reason that NTUC can assign their part-timers however they deem fit, although this is not inside the contract I signed. This is absolutely unfair to me, because, this was not told by my recruitment agency. I did explain the miscommunication, but it is not accepted or discussed by the NTUC manager at all.",Cashier,Former Employee,,"Jul 7, 2022"

If other workplace, even if I show those appointment dates and take picture of me and parents and clinic there's no guarantee that they will accept such excuse for my absence. 

Aside from that, work wise, if we talk about work only (not mentioning the type of people we work with) the work is fun to do.

They will hear you out properly and do what's needed as soon as possible. 2016 onwards till present is pure crap. The rude, inconsiderate and arrogant started to 'rule' from then on. Management didn't even take any action against them at all, and when some of us provide feedback in the most professional way possible, the only response they can give is 'the person character is already like that' 'different people different character' and many other rubbish explanation. Not only did they not take action against such people, they even promote them. So what happened is these type of people got more 'big headed'. Funny thing is, as for the ones who I see are usually good, polite, approachable, guide others, considerate, mindful and helpful, does a mistake by accident which is really seldom, the management will point it out and confront the person for it.
