2,2.0,average experience with shady staff members,location: it was close to home,"shift timing: it was based on an 8-hour work shift so morning (8am-4pm). afternoon (12pm-8pm), and evening (3pm-11pm). Plus, we only had one day off per week which was insane for a part-time job and the contract was three months long but many left the job after a week. Racial discrimination: on the first day, I met my colleagues who were Malay. Our supervisor was a Chinese middle-aged woman and she assigned them to the temperature screening station (which was literally our job scope) and separated me from the rest. She spoke to me in mandarin and asked me if I was Chinese (I'm Indonesian Chinese) and then said that I should do work that can benefit me and gain some skills along the way, implying that the temp screening job was for no-brainers. My new job was at the self-check-out counter where she ensured me that I could work my way up to cashiering but it was not what I wanted. Plus, when they took me off of that station (because I was underage and couldn't sell people alcohol, cigs, etc. = inconvenient), the Chinese ladies at that station were denigrating me and mocked my situation. Really fun working environment! Anyways, I hated that job and the environment. Left after a month because I needed cash.",Part Time Temperature Screener,Former Employee,"Choa Chu Kang New Town, ","Feb 19, 2023"
