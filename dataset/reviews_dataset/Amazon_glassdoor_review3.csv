Within my first week at Amazon, I knew that I was in the right place because of this: my team has a weekly meeting. During the weekly meeting our leader shared a ""Team Status Check"" diagram, which addresses mental health. We went around the room and all reported how we were doing. Then we talked out how to resolve any issues people were having. This action represented ""genuine care"" to me. The company didn't need to do this exercise. It was the pandemic, everybody has some amount of red, blue, or grey status. The company polls employees for their opinion daily. The company cares a lot about work/life balance. The company respects ""work hours"" and if people are working too much they will work to reduce the load. There are a lot of principals, but it is almost most important to me that they have defined the principals at all.","Imposter syndrome is real. You will feel highs and lows, but you belong here.

To survive you need to get pretty good at scheduling. Managers listen to data though so if you can show evidence that you don't have enough time for a project they will work with you to adjust scope.

The managers can sometimes forget they are managers and just show up to collect their check. Site leaders and GMs usually come from a background of not knowing whats going on and how to particularly run an amazon.

There are many different roles in the warehouse, so you can decide to learn many roles if you ask your manager about it. I learned amnesty and problem solve, and between that and the many roles I've performed, it helped me get a Staffing position. I do not currently hold this role, as I needed to move and they did not have the position open. That explains my Warehouse Associate role at the moment. 

I also have a 401k and a Roth and built over $6K between the two already before hitting 2 years. There's medical insurance and dental. I paid about $50 for an over $1K procedure since it was almost completely covered. The insurance is pretty good at Amazon.","They're having us all wear Safety shoes from now on, meaning shoes that protect the front of the feet.

159,1.0,Bottom Line over People,"The best part of my experience was the people I worked with. The most diverse group of individuals I have ever encountered who taught me so much, kept a smile on my face, and genuinely became my sole motivation for work. You will meet the best people here, unfortunately, the high ups don't interact with the associates who actually run Amazon, and their needs are subsided.","Overtime. During Peak last year I was working 65 hour work weeks with no overtime and no night differential. We were expected to put in 3x the work during the holiday season without any real benefit. As a manager, you don't get the perks that hourly employees get like two breaks, overtime, holiday pay, and any other benefits throughout the year. Management is separate from associates and has unbelievably high expectations for compensation that is.... let's say, not reflective of the work. It is no wonder the turnover is so high. The first 6 months of my job, I didn't take a lunch break because it was frowned upon to ever be off the floor. The second part of my tenure, I made sure I took a 30 minute break every night to eat and escape the craziness, but they told me that I shouldn't leave the building. Policing. I can't even describe how much of my time was wasted policing associates. I felt like a high school principal trying to get students in trouble. If you didn't give out enough written warnings every night, you had to go out of your way to look for people doing something wrong. So instead of helping my associates with problems they faced day to day, or working to achieve long term goals with them, or dedicating any time to fix the endless mechanical and technical problems faced on the daily, I had to spend my time going around my department trying to catch someone on their phone, or off task, or not doing their job in some other way. I used to have to go through everyone's time cards from the day before, find the people off task the most, and spend my time reprimanding the few strays who weren't doing their job, effectively ignoring the needs of all the associates who show up and do the right thing everyday. It was ridiculous and what made me lose my connections with the people, and therefore my work. Turnover. You could never get comfortable. As soon as you had a routine there were new associates, or new managers, or new ways to do the process, or new rules, or new write ups you had to give. It is a constantly revolving door that goes around and around without making any real progress. People were fired every day, and new people came in practically every week. No adjustment period, no getting comfortable, just work and work and work and pick up the pieces along the way. ""Do your best!"" they'd say, ""But I need to see more results"". I was constantly putting out fires on a sinking ship. Management. I was at Amazon for a little over a year, and I saw a multitude of leadership transitions. It's very cut-throat and I lost too many good leaders who moved to other jobs after not getting their well-deserved promotion. On the contrary, I had too many managers who were insufficient at their jobs and stayed in leadership positions simply because they were willing to be miserable for a paycheck. They cared about themselves, their careers, their opportunities, and ABOVE ALL, how YOU made them look to THEIR bosses. I would be on the floor, making real time quick decisions based on what I thought was best for the associates and operation, and I would be reprimanded because some higher up across the country looking at a screen of data, didn't like that decision, didn't think it was worth it, didn't see the positive result in the performance data. I constantly had to compete safety with performance instead of wholly prioritizing safety and putting performance on the back burner until the situation is resolved. Amazon is a giant company, and unfortunately, to a giant company, its all a numbers game. I used to defend Amazon, I wanted to be the difference, I wanted to change the narrative.... boy was I naive. I quickly learned that I was caring for my people way more than any manager was caring for me. And that being a good leader didn't get you recognized or praised, being a good manager did. A good manager does the reports on time and listens to their boss and does what is best for the company. A good leader looks out for their people and creates a team environment in which we can all thrive. I created a beautiful synergy in my first department on my own, I was a great leader and the associates would tell you they loved me. In my second department, I wasn't given the time or freedom to create meaningful relationships and was forced to go into strictly manager mode. Listen to your boss and do what you're told, even if you don't think its the right thing to do for the people. Working with people, especially the number of people I was working with (100+), requires a certain level of nuance. I was working with all different ages, ethnicities, backgrounds, and financial situations, and as easy as it would be to throw a blanket over everyone and treat them the same, there's no equity in that. Maybe it just wasn't the job for me, but I used to love it...

If you're based in Seattle, you get to go on a tour of Day 1, The Spheres, and re:Invent which is really fun and cool. My team is amazing and everyone gets along - It's definitely a tight knit community, but you need to get placed on a good team to have a good time at Amazon. The team is what makes or breaks it, in my opinion. The compensation is great for a fresh college grad and it's a HUGE plus. Flexible work hours are also great, but it depends on your manager. My manager allowed my team to pick their working hours since our team is spread out across the nation and we're all in different time zones. Additionally, my manager allows me to work from home but I am also able to go into the office whenever. Since Amazon is utilizing agile workspaces, you do not need to work in the office you are assigned to - You can work in any building that you have access to!","There's a lot of training to do, but that's typical when starting out at a new company in a new position. The trainings aren't so bad except for the repetitiveness and outdated information. It takes time for trainings to get updated when changes are made within the org. Since you spend so much time working with the Student Programs cohort, it's difficult to get to know your actual team in the beginning so you need to make the effort to get to know them on your own. Tip: Schedule 1:1s ASAP to get to know your coworkers! It's a tough job to source for candidates who are eligible for the role(s) you are trying to fill at Amazon.

479,2.0,Amazon Warehouse is burning through employees,More than minimum wage pay,"Nobody actually cares about you and management forces brand new employees to compete against each other creating an extremely toxic work environment with a 150% turnover rate.
To be a full time employee you must agree to mandatory overtime which will be called about 15 weeks of the year. 50 hours a week for 15 weeks a year with no extra time off because increased time off is earned by working for the company for years. During ""PEAK SEASONS: there is 5 days of 11.5 hour shifts MANDATORY"" The rates at which must be kept for you to not receive write ups is excessive and causes many employees to receive write ups and quit the company. This company purely focuses on hiring more and more employees to replace the ones that quit everyday because the morale is through the floor and the management literally walks around threatening to write employees up daily in a joking manner like its a funny joke.

499,5.0,Very impressed with Amazon,"I came into Amazon from a previous company that I'd grown in for over 17 years. I've now been at Amazon for 3 months and can say that I'm very impressed with many aspects:
1. The flexibility to manage my time between professional and personal effectively
2. The welcoming feeling I received when coming in to the company
3. The extensive Onboarding process that helps you with everything you need to know to be successful at Amazon and in your role
4. The growth opportunities here are exponential. Amazon is constantly growing and nurtures a culture of innovation so their answer is not always ""no"" first (this was alien to me and honestly very refreshing).
5. I feel like I'm making a difference not only in my role here but because the company I work for has policy positions that are making a difference in the world.
6. I absolutely love knowing that I'm working for a company that celebrates diversity of thought and actually wants you to bring yourself to work... not a version you think they want to see.
7. Total Compensation is good here and competitive to the market.",Its a really big company so there are a lot of people involved in the decision making and implementation process for the role I'm in. Navigating who to contact for what has been a challenge but I'm managing it.,Sales Compensation Specialist,Current Employee,"Atlanta, GA","Jun 2, 2022"
