0,"It's amazing to be in the middle of a company, so connected to much of what is being said and done in the world. It's a smart team and the Friday afternoon checking with leadership is a thoughtful and exceptional business practice.",Many people are moving very fast and focused on their own goals. Sometimes it's hard to find collaborators.,nil
1,"It might be easy to roll your eyes when people from Facebook say how open their culture is, but it's true; it's more open than any other place I've worked at. At a company wide-level, secret projects, public incidents, important non-public business metrics and the like are all openly discussed. You can ask questions about them directly to Zuckerburg at the weekly Q&A. I think the idea is that if everyone is on the same page or at least, differing views are heard, the company will be stronger, and solutions may be offered from a place you didn't expect. This is much different from previous companies I worked at, where discussions on internal email lists would be shut down by some lawyer saying that there's certain things that can't be discussed, and important data is divided up to groups and individuals on a ""need to know"" basis, etc. 

This culture applies at a lower level too. You feel comfortable giving feedback to each other about each other, about product decisions, about management, etc. The flipside of this openness is that you of course, have to be willing to receive the feedback, you have to recognize that while openness and feedback is highly encouraged, decisions have to get made, and actions and data are more valuable than words. At the higher level, since the company trusts employees with access to so much information, keeping such info confidential from the outside world is taken seriously.

It's a great place to work as an engineer. You're given a lot of freedom, but it's also a responsibility to make sure you're doing things that are valuable. You don't get much credit for working hard or being smart if you don't produce valuable output.

One cool thing about Facebook, in contrast to other comparable companies (Google, Amazon, and Microsoft, though in truth, FB is much smaller), is how they have a pretty singular focus. Even with the differing areas (including advertising and such), they do a good job of keeping their eye on their mission of connecting as many people as possible. I also think they are way more empathetic to their users than most people give them credit for. It seems like popular opinion has it that FB is arrogant and only cares about its users insomuch as they represent $-signs. From within the company, it didn't feel this way at all. I saw a lot of empathy towards users, and a lot effort spent to improve or things or fix broken things with no direct financial benefit. The strategy is not complex. The thinking is that if they can make FB easier and more fun to use, then more people will use it for more time each day (which will also have a network effect of attracting even more people to use it), then the advertising dollars will follow. Of course, it is true that FB wants to make the audience more accessible to advertisers as well, but there are a lot of people at FB who care about privacy and security.

They have really good infrastructure and really great ways to share the infrastructure and code. They have a lot of cool internal tools, and what they've built is really impressive, and more importantly, it helps your team build products faster without having to solve problems that someone else already solved. Every software company tries to do this, but FB seems to have been more successful with it. Perhaps it's because they're still relatively small, but if anything, I can at least say it is very cool while it lasts.

The perks and work environment are great, unless you're one of those types that can't stand open office spaces. I've worked in both a private office and open offices in multiple companies. While I do think a private office has some benefits, I mostly think it's a personal luxury for the employee and a huge waste of money for the company. I'd much rather have the money go into other areas like salary, benefits, and other workplace improvements rather than the added real estate necessary to have offices.

Of course, you've heard about the food and snacks. They have an amazing selection of great stuff, and what I like about it is that it sort of goes above and beyond expectations. Sure, some days, lunch is better than others, but I really can't complain, and the selection of drinks and snacks is amazing. It's not like you should work at FB just because of that, but it demonstrates FB's desire to make work as fun and convenient as possible.

You'll be surrounded by people who like being there. I can't think of a better environment to work in. If you have a giant ego, you may not like it as much. Respect is definitely given to those that have deep experience in the industry, and they are expected to lead others and mentor more junior employees. However, if for whatever reason, you can't perform at the level expected, no one is going to care if you did this and that at Google or shipped ten things at MS, etc.

FB also has a lot of fun events, and I made a lot of friends working there, so going to the events was fun. Also, if you're older and worried that FB is just a bunch of 22-year-olds, and that you won't fit in, I wouldn't worry about that. FB does have a lot of young employees (who are really smart btw), and it does hire a lot of people straight out of college, but it also attracts a lot of experienced engineers from other top companies like Google, MS, Amazon, etc.

Work-life-balance seemed totally normal to me. It may be different depending on your team, but I felt you could do 40-50 hours of work a week for the most part and you would be totally fine. It's about what you produce, not how hard you're working. Other team members who had children would work normal hours and go home at normal times. I didn't see any of these folks have a problem when they left early to take care of their child or things like that. Of course, there could be times that people are expected to work extra if something critical happens, but for the most part everyone wants to avoid this and this happens sparingly, from what I observed. Now, there were many times where I chose to work late myself, but I never felt any pressure to do so. The caveat is that there are on-call rotations, and in addition, even if you are not on-call, you are expected to be reasonably available if the on-call person needs your help. However, again, no one wants this, and your team will work on ways to avoid these situations.

The best thing I can say is that working at FB is about productivity. I didn't experience and political bs and it was a pleasure working with a group of people who were all concerned with producing a good product and making the best of the time spent while doing it.","FB expects a lot out of engineers, and you can't slack off. Of course, you shouldn't slack off at any job, but since FB is pretty fast-paced, there is a risk that you'll have trouble adjusting at first.

FB has a lot of custom infrastructure and tools, and prehaps more impressively, it works great. It makes doing your job really great, but on the other hand, you'll end up learning a lot of stuff that won't be applicable elsewhere.

FB's code-base is very good in some ways, but in other ways, it's not as great as some of the existing engineers think it is. I don't think this is that big of a deal, but the important part is that as an engineer, you need to quickly learn FB's values and practices and ""get with the program"" so to speak. If you don't like some things, then you just have to deal with it, as it's not likely you're going to change people's minds at this point. The nice thing is that things are at least very consistent.",nil
2,"- Incredible benefits 
- Excellent compensation that rewards strong performance 
- Lots of autonomy 
- Tons of room for growth
- Very transparent from the top down
- Strong leadership
- Intelligent and caring colleagues
- The most fair and well thought out review process you will find everywhere 
- Exciting work","- If you don't learn to make the work life balance work for you, it can be exhausting. But you'll also be given lots of support with this if you ask for it. 
- It doesn't matter how good you are at your job, chances are you're going to be surrounded by a ton of other people who are just as good if not better. Imposter syndrome is real, but if you got an offer, you probably belong here too.",nil
3,"I'm a 55 year old working in a company where the average age is 28, and I've never been happier. I have always wanted to work in a company where I wasn't the proverbial square peg, and after nearly 30 years in the work force, I believe that I have found the company that complements my ideology for how a company should operate. Here are the ""Pros"" as I see them...

- Leadership:  Mark Zuckerberg, Sheryl Sandberg, Chris Cox and the rest of the leadership team. Inspiring, smart and totally real.
- The Culture:  The openness is a real thing, we're trusted to do the right thing, mistakes are expected, being yourself is important and encouraged, humility is encouraged and expected, building trust is paramount, the mission of making the world a more open and connected place isn't just a cool phrase because it guides everything. It's not about us, it's about everyone else.
- The People:  Smart and nice is what I find. The diversity is better than any other company I've worked at and it's getting better. Those that are figuring out how to make what we do better for everyone are really good at implementing their ideas. Two years ago I didn't know what this company really was or if it had a secure future. I can clearly see now that they have what it takes to last, and it's sincere.
- Management:  Managers are hired because they're good managers and not because they're good at something else. The management track is different than the contributor track and they're equal in importance.
- Benefits:  Working in the Valley it's hard to differentiate all the benefits employees receive and Facebook is at least equal to all the major tech companies, but coming from Seattle the benefits are nothing short of incredible.

Granted, I haven't been with the company for very long and I'm still in the honeymoon period, but I can tell what's real and what's not; this place is for real.","Like any tech company, the work is big and complicated so work/life balance can suffer from time to time. The difference is that it's the passion within the individuals that drives them to work long hours and forego time off. Of course there can be times when schedule demands force the imbalance, but it's not such that 10-12 hours days become commonplace and expected regardless. We do what we do to get the job done; no one is killing themselves because there's an order to do so.

Being able to eat to your hearts/stomachs content can be dangerous to the waistline, but that's a self-control thing and not the company's issue.",nil
4,"Facebook deeply cares about its employees and has built a compelling culture around support and growth. Career growth opportunities are plentiful. If you don't like the team you're on or don't get the support you want from your manger, Facebook empowers you to find new teams or projects. Facebook wants its employees to be invested in their work and to feel connected to its larger mission. If large scale opportunities and growth are important to you, Facebook is a fantastic place to work.",Facebook's culture is demanding and fast paced. The greatest aspect of working at Facebook is that everyone is very motivated and very smart. The problem with this is that they all expect the very same of you. Holding a very high bar for excellence can certainly be demanding so it's important to make sure you're always carefully paying attention to your own personal work/life balance.,nil
5,"Overall, love the people I work with, love Meta's dedication to DEI in all we do, and we have an interesting value proposition for the future.","Huge lack of planning org-wide. This leads to continous layoffs/uncertainty and lots of duplication of work/inefficient processes. Also still fighting a culture that has been bottom up for so long, which in terms of being impactful and getting things done that benefit the business, not just individuals, makes things difficult as a manager.",nil
6,Overall great place to work. They truly invest in their people. Had some of my best managers here. A lot of room to be an entrepreneur and feel a sense of ownership over your career.,"Before their layoffs, the company was also too fragmented in terms of roles and responsibilities. It made it difficult to find your place and feel like you offer value. Company also changed priorities a lot which became discouraging after awhile because it was difficult to feel like you could accomplish anything.",nil
7,"You get what you expect - Really great benefits like one of the best healthcare I've seen in the US corporate world, stipends, great 401k match, great in office amenities, supportive ERGs, pretty good work-life balance, the brand name on resume (that may no longer be so relevant in 2023). All the people you work with are incredibly talented and smart. Super inclusive and diversity minded - everyone is open minded and respectful. Career opportunities are abound (lateral transfers and team changes) but you will have to be very sharp, politically savvy, and patient for a promotion. 3+ years wait for a promotion is not uncommon. If you came from start up environment this would be very difficult. Most of very smart ICs with leadership aspiration leave because they don't see themselves climbing or losing their life to compete in the pool. Good thing is I've seen everyone move on to higher paying jobs at arguably more fun companies after 2 years or so if you are fine with job hopping then this should be good!","Same.. You get what you expect from a huge company with lots of 'scandals' ; always being in news for negative headlines and layoffs impact employee morale. Constant org changes and bureaucratic processes impact how fast you can get work done even though you are constantly told to move fast. Getting a tiny change out takes weeks, and because it's tiny even though it can lead to great improvement long-term, it gets deprioritized and every resource gets put in bigger, higher impact projects. So you are building sophisticated castle on shaky sandy foundation, until things break!",nil
8,Benefits are great although they may go down now that they are tightening their belt. Great comp although with stock price decline may not be any more. Opportunity to work on large scale products.,"For senior folks it's hard to find projects with good scope. The company had layoffs, even for people left behind the morale is down and indications are more people will either be managed out or leave on their down. Meta is not growing but is shrinking. They still suffer significantly from being short term impact driven in PSC process, they've been trying to change this for years, even removed the Move Fast / Break Things and replaced with Long term. Problem is most of the folks in calibration and running the show still have short term impact in their DNA as they way they measure everything. Mark is very fixated on the meta-verse as a bet the company initiative. Problem is that he is spending soo much on it and the likely timeframe when it goes mainstream is still years out. Also the ads business is in trouble with the economy in decline and head winds from apples privacy changes, they basically need to rewrite the ads stack which will take a long time and revenue will suffer in the mean time.",nil
9,1) perceived career opportunities 2) socialization,"1) comments on internal workplace are more important than actual work, sorta like instagram pictures of influencers who can spin off a cool image, but there's nothing real behind it 2) management is very young, and instead of trying to solve actual problems in the team, defers it to HR. If someone complains to HR, no-one even checks if it was true or not. Even though a person is an excellent engineer, complaints will devoid that person of promotion",nil
10,"-Highly depends on your team and manager, but overall culture is great helpful teammates, supportive leadership, focus on solving problems vs pointing fingers, recognizes hard work. -Also depends on the team but hybrid WFH/on-site is a huge pro, nobody checks when you're online or in office as long as you get your work done and stay responsive during business hours. -culture of direct feedback and transparency - you'll know where you stand and what areas you need to improve on to accomplish your career goals","-Lots of changes and constant shifts in strategy/org structure add a lot of operational work, but finance has a great centralized function to streamline reporting/data pulls -short staffed after layoffs, work-life balance isn't good during busy periods but that's true for most companies these days",nil

15,Meta has great direction from leadership overall. Makes solid investments when there is a strategy decided on e.g. Reality Labs efforts. Great compensation and perks.

Really open and inclusive culture that existed back before DE&I.,"Too many managers and all that comes with a middle heavy org structure. Things feel pear shaped.

17,High compensation Great internal infrastructure Impressive internal tooling to quickly build and iterate over product experiences.,"Shift towards remote culture, for a company this big is a tremendous downside.

69,"I just left Google and joined Facebook, and felt so much happier. The reasons are:

1. The real impact
At Google I joined a team whose product is only used by less than 1000 people, and even for that product I was assigned to do a peripheral part, whose functionality actually doesn't matter at all. Just for that module, I had to write unit test for every silly part of the code, and took long iteration cycles. I admit those are good engineering coding trainings, however taking precious time in my life to work on something that doesn't matter is just a waste of my life.

In Facebook things just move so much faster. There are standard software engineering review process but not as rigid. Just during training (boot camp) weeks, I had tasks to change very important part of Facebook's core code, and the second day after I check-in my code, it got shipped to almost 1 billion people. As a software engineer I cannot recall a moment I felt better for my job.

Then I joined a team that's extremely important to Facebook's revenue. A mistake in the code I changed could cause Facebook million dollar a day. However Facebook just trusted us, allowed us making mistake and having quick iteration cycles to test ideas fast. If I make a coding mistake in my team in Google it might cost Google nothing in terms of revenue as my product was small, however the development process was so strict I could not have chance to try my innovations or test my ideas. But in Facebook that's all possible.

2. The organizational structure
Google's organization is now very structured and hierarchical. Facebook is having more layers, but the working style is still flat, and social-network style. Speaking to people in different teams, form an idea, lead a virtual team and complete it, this style is still valued. My boss is more like a mentor helping me navigating through the ideas, rather than an authority telling me what to do.","1. I don't quite like the office decoration style. A little bit stressful and factory like.
2. The compensation is better than Google but not as good as other smaller companies.
3. Despite good acquisitions for solidify the position in social media, social networks, there is still uncertainty about the future of this company.",nil

The employees are smart and also care about each other.,"In terms of communication, the company still operates like a start up. No one uses email and requests are sent via chat. It can be hard to keep track of where you read something or what you need to do.

Some really great people who want to make the platform better and safer for the users.","So many people doing the same work across the company but since it’s a bottoms up culture no one is reigning in the chaos. Meta could do with A LOT less staff if they had any real leadership that required people to align and remove duplicative work.

Your work is thrashed all the time because of lack of leadership and strategic thinking/planning. If you are lucky, half of what you do will make it to the finish line. This is a huge concern when going for your annual review because you are calibrated with others and depending on how your manager sells your work (or doesn’t) will really affect your career and progression.

Most executives still prioritize “giving people voice” over addressing platform concerns and the negative impacts that the platforms can cause. They need to take issues more seriously.

There are A LOT of bad managers that can derail your career. Going to HR is useless because they are there to support the manager and limit risk to Meta. I can’t tell you how many people I worked with that took paid mental health leave because of their bad manager. If you get a bad manager get out the team ASAP because it will take them at least 12 months to work them out once they have enough complaints and that is long enough for them to destroy your career.

There is no way for you to dispute your review. Some of my colleagues received a poor review from their manager but the review included inaccurate or false information (they had documentation to prove it), but there is no formal process to dispute your review. A bad review could cost you your career or make it difficult for you to switch teams.

Leadership is leaving left and right which should raise some red flags. Metaverse is a big bet that will take years to pay off (if at all). How many people want to live in a virtual world? No thanks, I prefer to live in reality. Yes, there are benefits like training surgeons to do surgery before they touch a human but has anyone heard Mark mention using the metaverse that way?
