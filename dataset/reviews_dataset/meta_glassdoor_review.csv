0,5.0,PDO - GO,"Amazing place to work, great offices, amazing people, good vision",Most people are remote now so not much coworker interaction. Layoffs,Project Manager,Current Employee,"Sunnyvale, CA","Mar 17, 2023"
1,5.0,"Open, fast, no bs","It might be easy to roll your eyes when people from Facebook say how open their culture is, but it's true; it's more open than any other place I've worked at. At a company wide-level, secret projects, public incidents, important non-public business metrics and the like are all openly discussed. You can ask questions about them directly to Zuckerburg at the weekly Q&A. I think the idea is that if everyone is on the same page or at least, differing views are heard, the company will be stronger, and solutions may be offered from a place you didn't expect. This is much different from previous companies I worked at, where discussions on internal email lists would be shut down by some lawyer saying that there's certain things that can't be discussed, and important data is divided up to groups and individuals on a ""need to know"" basis, etc. 

This culture applies at a lower level too. You feel comfortable giving feedback to each other about each other, about product decisions, about management, etc. The flipside of this openness is that you of course, have to be willing to receive the feedback, you have to recognize that while openness and feedback is highly encouraged, decisions have to get made, and actions and data are more valuable than words. At the higher level, since the company trusts employees with access to so much information, keeping such info confidential from the outside world is taken seriously.

It's a great place to work as an engineer. You're given a lot of freedom, but it's also a responsibility to make sure you're doing things that are valuable. You don't get much credit for working hard or being smart if you don't produce valuable output.

One cool thing about Facebook, in contrast to other comparable companies (Google, Amazon, and Microsoft, though in truth, FB is much smaller), is how they have a pretty singular focus. Even with the differing areas (including advertising and such), they do a good job of keeping their eye on their mission of connecting as many people as possible. I also think they are way more empathetic to their users than most people give them credit for. It seems like popular opinion has it that FB is arrogant and only cares about its users insomuch as they represent $-signs. From within the company, it didn't feel this way at all. I saw a lot of empathy towards users, and a lot effort spent to improve or things or fix broken things with no direct financial benefit. The strategy is not complex. The thinking is that if they can make FB easier and more fun to use, then more people will use it for more time each day (which will also have a network effect of attracting even more people to use it), then the advertising dollars will follow. Of course, it is true that FB wants to make the audience more accessible to advertisers as well, but there are a lot of people at FB who care about privacy and security.

They have really good infrastructure and really great ways to share the infrastructure and code. They have a lot of cool internal tools, and what they've built is really impressive, and more importantly, it helps your team build products faster without having to solve problems that someone else already solved. Every software company tries to do this, but FB seems to have been more successful with it. Perhaps it's because they're still relatively small, but if anything, I can at least say it is very cool while it lasts.

The perks and work environment are great, unless you're one of those types that can't stand open office spaces. I've worked in both a private office and open offices in multiple companies. While I do think a private office has some benefits, I mostly think it's a personal luxury for the employee and a huge waste of money for the company. I'd much rather have the money go into other areas like salary, benefits, and other workplace improvements rather than the added real estate necessary to have offices.

Of course, you've heard about the food and snacks. They have an amazing selection of great stuff, and what I like about it is that it sort of goes above and beyond expectations. Sure, some days, lunch is better than others, but I really can't complain, and the selection of drinks and snacks is amazing. It's not like you should work at FB just because of that, but it demonstrates FB's desire to make work as fun and convenient as possible.

You'll be surrounded by people who like being there. I can't think of a better environment to work in. If you have a giant ego, you may not like it as much. Respect is definitely given to those that have deep experience in the industry, and they are expected to lead others and mentor more junior employees. However, if for whatever reason, you can't perform at the level expected, no one is going to care if you did this and that at Google or shipped ten things at MS, etc.

FB also has a lot of fun events, and I made a lot of friends working there, so going to the events was fun. Also, if you're older and worried that FB is just a bunch of 22-year-olds, and that you won't fit in, I wouldn't worry about that. FB does have a lot of young employees (who are really smart btw), and it does hire a lot of people straight out of college, but it also attracts a lot of experienced engineers from other top companies like Google, MS, Amazon, etc.

Work-life-balance seemed totally normal to me. It may be different depending on your team, but I felt you could do 40-50 hours of work a week for the most part and you would be totally fine. It's about what you produce, not how hard you're working. Other team members who had children would work normal hours and go home at normal times. I didn't see any of these folks have a problem when they left early to take care of their child or things like that. Of course, there could be times that people are expected to work extra if something critical happens, but for the most part everyone wants to avoid this and this happens sparingly, from what I observed. Now, there were many times where I chose to work late myself, but I never felt any pressure to do so. The caveat is that there are on-call rotations, and in addition, even if you are not on-call, you are expected to be reasonably available if the on-call person needs your help. However, again, no one wants this, and your team will work on ways to avoid these situations.

The best thing I can say is that working at FB is about productivity. I didn't experience and political bs and it was a pleasure working with a group of people who were all concerned with producing a good product and making the best of the time spent while doing it.","FB expects a lot out of engineers, and you can't slack off. Of course, you shouldn't slack off at any job, but since FB is pretty fast-paced, there is a risk that you'll have trouble adjusting at first.

FB has a lot of custom infrastructure and tools, and prehaps more impressively, it works great. It makes doing your job really great, but on the other hand, you'll end up learning a lot of stuff that won't be applicable elsewhere.

FB's code-base is very good in some ways, but in other ways, it's not as great as some of the existing engineers think it is. I don't think this is that big of a deal, but the important part is that as an engineer, you need to quickly learn FB's values and practices and ""get with the program"" so to speak. If you don't like some things, then you just have to deal with it, as it's not likely you're going to change people's minds at this point. The nice thing is that things are at least very consistent.",Software Development Engineer,Former Employee,"Seattle, WA","Mar 17, 2014"

3,5.0,Pleasantly Surprised,"I'm a 55 year old working in a company where the average age is 28, and I've never been happier. I have always wanted to work in a company where I wasn't the proverbial square peg, and after nearly 30 years in the work force, I believe that I have found the company that complements my ideology for how a company should operate. Here are the ""Pros"" as I see them...

- Leadership:  Mark Zuckerberg, Sheryl Sandberg, Chris Cox and the rest of the leadership team. Inspiring, smart and totally real.
- The Culture:  The openness is a real thing, we're trusted to do the right thing, mistakes are expected, being yourself is important and encouraged, humility is encouraged and expected, building trust is paramount, the mission of making the world a more open and connected place isn't just a cool phrase because it guides everything. It's not about us, it's about everyone else.
- The People:  Smart and nice is what I find. The diversity is better than any other company I've worked at and it's getting better. Those that are figuring out how to make what we do better for everyone are really good at implementing their ideas. Two years ago I didn't know what this company really was or if it had a secure future. I can clearly see now that they have what it takes to last, and it's sincere.
- Management:  Managers are hired because they're good managers and not because they're good at something else. The management track is different than the contributor track and they're equal in importance.
- Benefits:  Working in the Valley it's hard to differentiate all the benefits employees receive and Facebook is at least equal to all the major tech companies, but coming from Seattle the benefits are nothing short of incredible.

Granted, I haven't been with the company for very long and I'm still in the honeymoon period, but I can tell what's real and what's not; this place is for real.","Like any tech company, the work is big and complicated so work/life balance can suffer from time to time. The difference is that it's the passion within the individuals that drives them to work long hours and forego time off. Of course there can be times when schedule demands force the imbalance, but it's not such that 10-12 hours days become commonplace and expected regardless. We do what we do to get the job done; no one is killing themselves because there's an order to do so.

Being able to eat to your hearts/stomachs content can be dangerous to the waistline, but that's a self-control thing and not the company's issue.",Site Selection Program Manager,Current Employe,"Menlo Park, CA","Feb 16, 2016"
4,2.0,Wanted to love it,"* salary/perks/401k contributions 
* A lot of really smart people to learn from and grow your skills. Well-seasoned ""engineers at heart"". 
* Access to incredible scale (of systems) not present outside of FAANG * If you get lucky, you'll get a good manager who has your back and maintains integrity and helps you grow. If you're even luckier, you'll get into a functional team with reasonable expectations.","* lots of toxic senior people and management that will use any excuse to cut you down and lie to your face repeatedly without consequences 
* Lots of insufferable politics that leave services in a terrible state and the team ends up with really high turnover rate because no one wants to stay
 * Extreme, constant, and unnecessary pressure to ""perform"" that may leave you with poor mental and physical health. 
* If there's no metrics to back anything you've invested effort into in order to do it right/better for the long term, it didn't happen and it doesn't matter. 
* Be prepared to constantly defend your entire existence and worth, especially if you're an early-career engineer. There's no trust in engineers, only engineers who become at least part-time politicians. Be prepared to become a blogger so you can advertise everything you're doing to people who don't care by posting to internal groups so that it looks good in front of management and is easier to ""sell"" during performance evaluations. An introvert's nightmare. 
* There's no ""bottom-up"" culture anymore, you do what you're told, or else.",Production Engineer,Current Employee,"Bellevue, WA","Mar 10, 2023"
5,5.0,People Focused,"Facebook deeply cares about its employees and has built a compelling culture around support and growth. Career growth opportunities are plentiful. If you don't like the team you're on or don't get the support you want from your manger, Facebook empowers you to find new teams or projects. Facebook wants its employees to be invested in their work and to feel connected to its larger mission. If large scale opportunities and growth are important to you, Facebook is a fantastic place to work.",Facebook's culture is demanding and fast paced. The greatest aspect of working at Facebook is that everyone is very motivated and very smart. The problem with this is that they all expect the very same of you. Holding a very high bar for excellence can certainly be demanding so it's important to make sure you're always carefully paying attention to your own personal work/life balance.,Engineering Manager,Current Employee,"San Francisco, CA","May 24, 2020"
6,4.0,it's fine. the sun will eventually swallow our planet.,"- good benefits (wellness and 401k in particular) - great internal tools - integration between privacy, code review, task management, etc systems is honestly really really impressive. I wish this kind of thing was just open source and available to the general public - new macbook pro and work iphone. Feels nice to disconnect at the end of the day - you can install Ableton Live or Steam or whatever on your work laptop. We've crowdsourced security. Godspeed You! IT People - very remote friendly (at least for now) with support to visit main office quarterly - I really respect the people I work with. Clever and (mostly) patient. - plenty of snacks, drinks, golden handcuffs, etc in-office but all the drinks are loaded with caffeine. Lemme get just a nice ginger kombucha please - really excellent food at MPK. Hats off to the food service folks - everyone I work with cares about writing quality code and doing careful ML work","- why is there so much money flowing to this goofy industry? - why can't we as a society afford to feed and house people, but we can allocate a zillion dollars to Facebook??? - Mark owns an estate in Hawaii? sus. you don't need all that money. I barely need my IC4 money. Grow up. Get a real haircut. - I regularly run into tables without documentation or ambiguous columns with no comments. Sometimes comments just say ""contact jerry about this"" but jerry hasn't worked there for 10 years - I have wrestled with more bureaucracy here than I ever did in academia. I will concede that in some cases this is good for privacy - Mark saying ""Why did our stock price tank? Oh it's because our engineers are too lazy! Time to fire thousands of them. But uhhhhhhhhhhhh I take responsibility I guess"" isn't great. Buddy, the stock market is not God. Money is fake. Stocks even more so. We're all just twiddling our thumbs until we die. None of this is real. Embrace the void. Give someone you don't know $20. Call your mom.

7,2.0,"Good colleagues, crap leadership","I have worked with some of the most talented and caring people in my time at Meta. The work is constantly changing, which can either keep you engaged (me) or frustrate you.","The leadership at Meta is completely and utterly terrible, and getting worse every year. The company direction is to chase the next big thing — crypto, short-form video, the meta verse — without putting enough thought or care into how it should be done. There has been no accountability for mistake that lead to the 11/22 lay-offs, and the “year of efficiency” in 2023 has, so far, been a farce as very little work is getting done.",Research Manager,Current Employee,"Menlo Park, CA","Mar 12, 2023"

It seemed to be a job with stability and a place where you can be yourself. Benefits are great and the people are excellent for the most part.","Unfortunately Meta has over-hired and laid off 11,ooo people. I've had four managers in 8 months. The work flow was so broken we resorted to using google docs/sheets most of the time. The clarity of how you accomplish things is often muddled and it causes everyone to have to re-create the wheel constantly. The performance review process was a disaster in so many ways, They have adjusted it going forward, but overall clear and concise feedback was like vapor, hard to capture anything constructive. It does seem that the sad reality is that the bottoms up culture just means you have to work harder, there's just that many more things that you have to carve out time for on an ongoing basis.",Leadership Sourcer,Current Employee,"Honolulu, HI","Nov 21, 2022"

All the people you work with are incredibly talented and smart. Super inclusive and diversity minded - everyone is open minded and respectful. Career opportunities are abound (lateral transfers and team changes) but you will have to be very sharp, politically savvy, and patient for a promotion. 3+ years wait for a promotion is not uncommon.

262,5.0,Career-Changing Opportunity,"• Meta is an incredible place to gain experience, work (and network!) with people who are at the top of their fields, and grow your own skill set—IF you invest the effort and time to make it happen. 
• Many employees have the chance to work with people from all over the world, in an environment that encourages different perspectives. 
• I never thought someone like me would belong at a company like this—but I feel welcomed and encouraged, and I'm grateful to have learned so much (personally and professionally) from my coworkers. Never would've believed I'd feel this way while starting remotely during COVID, either!
• Most managers at Meta really want to be managers; folks aren't promoted just because it's the next most logical step in their career. In my experience, this means most managers are supportive, want to see you succeed, and are invested in helping you grow your career, not just in furthering their own agenda.
• Comp & benefits are amazing. WHY DID MY GUIDANCE COUNSELORS IN HIGH SCHOOL AND COLLEGE NOT TELL ME ABOUT RSUs??? That is all. 
• Having Meta on your resumé will open doors in a way that name dropping few other companies would.
• The support Meta provided throughout COVID has been exceptional, with flexibility and leave options that have helped me deal with remote learning, childcare gaps, and more. I've repeatedly told friends how lucky I have been to have joined Meta just before the pandemic.","• There are high expectations. ""Move fast"" isn't just a value — it's a description of how we work. If you like rigid work structures and aligning to predefined goals without questioning or re-assessing them as you progress, you probably won't thrive in the Meta environment. 
• Because of this constant flux, it can be hard to take PTO or maintain a consistently good work/life balance. This honestly depends on your team and manager, as well as how good you are at prioritizing. (Hint: Get comfortable saying no.)
• Constant press leaks continue to threaten the previously ""open by default"" culture, complicating some teams' jobs (as they react to announcements vs. prepare for announcements).",Project Manager,Current Employee,"San Francisco, CA","Jan 25, 2022"

I am an h1b, much like most facebook employees, and i am threatened with being booted from the program whenever i attempt to protect customer data from being exposed. If anyone from management is reading this i sincerely believe facebook is the proverbial boulder rolling down a hill with too much momentum to stop the downward slide.

For mid-career professionals (L5-L6 in particular), advancement is tougher as the company gets bigger/evolves; seems like there are more growth opportunities for junior levels (in terms of promo: L2/L3) and senior levels (in terms of new areas of learning/expansion: L8/D1+). For SOME people, the high ambiguity, fast pace, and 99% self-determination of one's career will not fit their personal preferences. For me personally, it works well. But I have friends at the company who are quite frustrated/unhappy due to the lack of tops-down order and seemingly chaotic shifting of priorities and strategies. (Note: I work in Facebook Reality Labs, which is definitely more nascent and a bit different in flavor than the 'core apps' teams.)",Senior Research Manager,Current Employee,"Menlo Park, CA","Jan 3, 2021"

602,2.0,Publicity skills are more important than Engineering,"Great pay, perks, benefits and cool offices. Friendly people (at least on the surface)","What I find most annoying and frustrating (found other IC4 or 3 DEs also share the same frustration) are: 
1 - The role: Like someone else mentioned I can’t see why we have ‘engineer’ in our title. It’s like 80% of your day goes about project management, expectation management, navigating team and product priorities, finding work for yourself and just what you need to do next. Then keeping others and yourself updated about what’s going on. When you can get a break from constant meetings and notifications and pings in chat then you can get some work done (Hello overtime). Also put aside time for advertising yourself, writing posts about what great things you are going to do, doing now, and have already done. Add a ton of stress on top of that for delivering IMPACT and constantly wondering if what you are doing is going to create enough noise to get you somewhere.
2 - Lack of well defined projects: you have to put in so much time and energy just to find something to work on. It’s like a manager decides they need some more headcount on their the team and hire the person and then tell them I don’t know what you need to do but there’s something out there for sure, go find out! Good for you if you can find or define a new impactful project, otherwise take on someone else’s work which they abandoned for something with more IMPACT or start working on some product that’s not going anywhere but some vp cares about.

Other things to consider: 
- The role : Data Engineers at FB are in a tough position. Usually noone in other roles really know what you are supposed to do, even DEs themselves will have a bootcamp course to tell them what they are supposed to do. As such you are always in the position of pushing back on requests, trying to define what you should do, or seeking to do the job someone else is already doing but in a better way. If you fail to push back you’ll be flooded with meaningless work (adhoc requests).

Other cons:
- Lack of Knowledge sharing and documentation: A piece of info you seek could be in a post on workplace, stored on some random quip, a file on dropbox, a sheet on google drive, or some random wiki page. And when you find it you can never trust what you see because it is possibly wrong or already outdated. Better to directly ask someone and hope they have the correct answer to your question. Enjoy waiting for responses or not finding any available time on their calendar to book a meeting.

-Moving Fast= Tons of junk: Moving fast to deliver short term impact has plagued the analytics org with tons of garbage. Noone cares about optimizing their solutions or documenting their work, and when they get credit for the IMPACT they move on to the next thing. Good luck if you inherit someone’s work which you need to make sense of on your own.",Data Engineer,Current Employee,"Menlo Park, CA","Mar 12, 2021"

The ""don't talk to me unless you've got a prototype in hand"" culture can feel like it's stifling ideas (even though it's a very reasonable reaction against pie-in-the-sky proposals). Proper architecture and code quality can be big problems.

There's a strong emphasis on social networking as a means of getting things done. For introverts this can be unduly difficult, and even for extroverts it can come across as a triumph of personality and schmoozing over sound engineering principles. There is a strong emphasis on trying to fabricate relationships in order to have impact, which can feel extremely deceitful.",Software Engineering Manager,Current Employe,"San Jose, CA","Oct 27, 2020"
