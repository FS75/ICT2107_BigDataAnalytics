1,5,"Open, fast, no bs","It might be easy to roll your eyes when people from Facebook say how open their culture is, but it's true; it's more open than any other place I've worked at. At a company wide-level, secret projects, public incidents, important non-public business metrics and the like are all openly discussed. You can ask questions about them directly to Zuckerburg at the weekly Q&A. I think the idea is that if everyone is on the same page or at least, differing views are heard, the company will be stronger, and solutions may be offered from a place you didn't expect. This is much different from previous companies I worked at, where discussions on internal email lists would be shut down by some lawyer saying that there's certain things that can't be discussed, and important data is divided up to groups and individuals on a ""need to know"" basis, etc. 

This culture applies at a lower level too. You feel comfortable giving feedback to each other about each other, about product decisions, about management, etc. The flipside of this openness is that you of course, have to be willing to receive the feedback, you have to recognize that while openness and feedback is highly encouraged, decisions have to get made, and actions and data are more valuable than words. At the higher level, since the company trusts employees with access to so much information, keeping such info confidential from the outside world is taken seriously.

It's a great place to work as an engineer. You're given a lot of freedom, but it's also a responsibility to make sure you're doing things that are valuable. You don't get much credit for working hard or being smart if you don't produce valuable output.

One cool thing about Facebook, in contrast to other comparable companies (Google, Amazon, and Microsoft, though in truth, FB is much smaller), is how they have a pretty singular focus. Even with the differing areas (including advertising and such), they do a good job of keeping their eye on their mission of connecting as many people as possible. I also think they are way more empathetic to their users than most people give them credit for. It seems like popular opinion has it that FB is arrogant and only cares about its users insomuch as they represent $-signs. From within the company, it didn't feel this way at all. I saw a lot of empathy towards users, and a lot effort spent to improve or things or fix broken things with no direct financial benefit. The strategy is not complex. The thinking is that if they can make FB easier and more fun to use, then more people will use it for more time each day (which will also have a network effect of attracting even more people to use it), then the advertising dollars will follow. Of course, it is true that FB wants to make the audience more accessible to advertisers as well, but there are a lot of people at FB who care about privacy and security.

They have really good infrastructure and really great ways to share the infrastructure and code. They have a lot of cool internal tools, and what they've built is really impressive, and more importantly, it helps your team build products faster without having to solve problems that someone else already solved. Every software company tries to do this, but FB seems to have been more successful with it. Perhaps it's because they're still relatively small, but if anything, I can at least say it is very cool while it lasts.

The perks and work environment are great, unless you're one of those types that can't stand open office spaces. I've worked in both a private office and open offices in multiple companies. While I do think a private office has some benefits, I mostly think it's a personal luxury for the employee and a huge waste of money for the company. I'd much rather have the money go into other areas like salary, benefits, and other workplace improvements rather than the added real estate necessary to have offices.

Of course, you've heard about the food and snacks. They have an amazing selection of great stuff, and what I like about it is that it sort of goes above and beyond expectations. Sure, some days, lunch is better than others, but I really can't complain, and the selection of drinks and snacks is amazing. It's not like you should work at FB just because of that, but it demonstrates FB's desire to make work as fun and convenient as possible.

You'll be surrounded by people who like being there. I can't think of a better environment to work in. If you have a giant ego, you may not like it as much. Respect is definitely given to those that have deep experience in the industry, and they are expected to lead others and mentor more junior employees. However, if for whatever reason, you can't perform at the level expected, no one is going to care if you did this and that at Google or shipped ten things at MS, etc.

FB also has a lot of fun events, and I made a lot of friends working there, so going to the events was fun. Also, if you're older and worried that FB is just a bunch of 22-year-olds, and that you won't fit in, I wouldn't worry about that. FB does have a lot of young employees (who are really smart btw), and it does hire a lot of people straight out of college, but it also attracts a lot of experienced engineers from other top companies like Google, MS, Amazon, etc.

Work-life-balance seemed totally normal to me. It may be different depending on your team, but I felt you could do 40-50 hours of work a week for the most part and you would be totally fine. It's about what you produce, not how hard you're working. Other team members who had children would work normal hours and go home at normal times. I didn't see any of these folks have a problem when they left early to take care of their child or things like that. Of course, there could be times that people are expected to work extra if something critical happens, but for the most part everyone wants to avoid this and this happens sparingly, from what I observed. Now, there were many times where I chose to work late myself, but I never felt any pressure to do so. The caveat is that there are on-call rotations, and in addition, even if you are not on-call, you are expected to be reasonably available if the on-call person needs your help. However, again, no one wants this, and your team will work on ways to avoid these situations.

The best thing I can say is that working at FB is about productivity. I didn't experience and political bs and it was a pleasure working with a group of people who were all concerned with producing a good product and making the best of the time spent while doing it.","FB expects a lot out of engineers, and you can't slack off. Of course, you shouldn't slack off at any job, but since FB is pretty fast-paced, there is a risk that you'll have trouble adjusting at first.

FB has a lot of custom infrastructure and tools, and prehaps more impressively, it works great. It makes doing your job really great, but on the other hand, you'll end up learning a lot of stuff that won't be applicable elsewhere.

FB's code-base is very good in some ways, but in other ways, it's not as great as some of the existing engineers think it is. I don't think this is that big of a deal, but the important part is that as an engineer, you need to quickly learn FB's values and practices and ""get with the program"" so to speak. If you don't like some things, then you just have to deal with it, as it's not likely you're going to change people's minds at this point. The nice thing is that things are at least very consistent.",Software Development Engineer,Former Employee,"Seattle, WA","Mar 17, 2014"

3,5,Pleasantly Surprised,"I'm a 55 year old working in a company where the average age is 28, and I've never been happier. I have always wanted to work in a company where I wasn't the proverbial square peg, and after nearly 30 years in the work force, I believe that I have found the company that complements my ideology for how a company should operate. Here are the ""Pros"" as I see them...

- Leadership:  Mark Zuckerberg, Sheryl Sandberg, Chris Cox and the rest of the leadership team. Inspiring, smart and totally real.
- The Culture:  The openness is a real thing, we're trusted to do the right thing, mistakes are expected, being yourself is important and encouraged, humility is encouraged and expected, building trust is paramount, the mission of making the world a more open and connected place isn't just a cool phrase because it guides everything. It's not about us, it's about everyone else.
- The People:  Smart and nice is what I find. The diversity is better than any other company I've worked at and it's getting better. Those that are figuring out how to make what we do better for everyone are really good at implementing their ideas. Two years ago I didn't know what this company really was or if it had a secure future. I can clearly see now that they have what it takes to last, and it's sincere.
- Management:  Managers are hired because they're good managers and not because they're good at something else. The management track is different than the contributor track and they're equal in importance.
- Benefits:  Working in the Valley it's hard to differentiate all the benefits employees receive and Facebook is at least equal to all the major tech companies, but coming from Seattle the benefits are nothing short of incredible.

Granted, I haven't been with the company for very long and I'm still in the honeymoon period, but I can tell what's real and what's not; this place is for real.","Like any tech company, the work is big and complicated so work/life balance can suffer from time to time. The difference is that it's the passion within the individuals that drives them to work long hours and forego time off. Of course there can be times when schedule demands force the imbalance, but it's not such that 10-12 hours days become commonplace and expected regardless. We do what we do to get the job done; no one is killing themselves because there's an order to do so.

Being able to eat to your hearts/stomachs content can be dangerous to the waistline, but that's a self-control thing and not the company's issue.",Site Selection Program Manager,Current Employee,"Menlo Park, CA","Feb 16, 2016"

* A lot of really smart people to learn from and grow your skills. Well-seasoned ""engineers at heart"". 
* Access to incredible scale (of systems) not present outside of FAANG * If you get lucky, you'll get a good manager who has your back and maintains integrity and helps you grow. If you're even luckier, you'll get into a functional team with reasonable expectations.","* lots of toxic senior people and management that will use any excuse to cut you down and lie to your face repeatedly without consequences 
* Lots of insufferable politics that leave services in a terrible state and the team ends up with really high turnover rate because no one wants to stay
 * Extreme, constant, and unnecessary pressure to ""perform"" that may leave you with poor mental and physical health. 
* If there's no metrics to back anything you've invested effort into in order to do it right/better for the long term, it didn't happen and it doesn't matter. 
* Be prepared to constantly defend your entire existence and worth, especially if you're an early-career engineer. There's no trust in engineers, only engineers who become at least part-time politicians. Be prepared to become a blogger so you can advertise everything you're doing to people who don't care by posting to internal groups so that it looks good in front of management and is easier to ""sell"" during performance evaluations.

25,5,Landslide win over Google for career growth,"I just left Google and joined Facebook, and felt so much happier. The reasons are:

1. The real impact
At Google I joined a team whose product is only used by less than 1000 people, and even for that product I was assigned to do a peripheral part, whose functionality actually doesn't matter at all. Just for that module, I had to write unit test for every silly part of the code, and took long iteration cycles. I admit those are good engineering coding trainings, however taking precious time in my life to work on something that doesn't matter is just a waste of my life.

In Facebook things just move so much faster. There are standard software engineering review process but not as rigid. Just during training (boot camp) weeks, I had tasks to change very important part of Facebook's core code, and the second day after I check-in my code, it got shipped to almost 1 billion people. As a software engineer I cannot recall a moment I felt better for my job.

Then I joined a team that's extremely important to Facebook's revenue. A mistake in the code I changed could cause Facebook million dollar a day. However Facebook just trusted us, allowed us making mistake and having quick iteration cycles to test ideas fast. If I make a coding mistake in my team in Google it might cost Google nothing in terms of revenue as my product was small, however the development process was so strict I could not have chance to try my innovations or test my ideas. But in Facebook that's all possible.

2. The organizational structure
Google's organization is now very structured and hierarchical. Facebook is having more layers, but the working style is still flat, and social-network style. Speaking to people in different teams, form an idea, lead a virtual team and complete it, this style is still valued. My boss is more like a mentor helping me navigating through the ideas, rather than an authority telling me what to do.","1. I don't quite like the office decoration style. A little bit stressful and factory like.
2. The compensation is better than Google but not as good as other smaller companies.

Some really great people who want to make the platform better and safer for the users.","So many people doing the same work across the company but since it’s a bottoms up culture no one is reigning in the chaos. Meta could do with A LOT less staff if they had any real leadership that required people to align and remove duplicative work.

Your work is thrashed all the time because of lack of leadership and strategic thinking/planning. If you are lucky, half of what you do will make it to the finish line. This is a huge concern when going for your annual review because you are calibrated with others and depending on how your manager sells your work (or doesn’t) will really affect your career and progression.

Most executives still prioritize “giving people voice” over addressing platform concerns and the negative impacts that the platforms can cause. They need to take issues more seriously.

There are A LOT of bad managers that can derail your career. Going to HR is useless because they are there to support the manager and limit risk to Meta. I can’t tell you how many people I worked with that took paid mental health leave because of their bad manager. If you get a bad manager get out the team ASAP because it will take them at least 12 months to work them out once they have enough complaints and that is long enough for them to destroy your career.

There is no way for you to dispute your review. Some of my colleagues received a poor review from their manager but the review included inaccurate or false information (they had documentation to prove it), but there is no formal process to dispute your review. A bad review could cost you your career or make it difficult for you to switch teams.

Leadership is leaving left and right which should raise some red flags. Metaverse is a big bet that will take years to pay off (if at all). How many people want to live in a virtual world? No thanks, I prefer to live in reality. Yes, there are benefits like training surgeons to do surgery before they touch a human but has anyone heard Mark mention using the metaverse that way?

The company culture is so supportive and empowering, and it's so refreshing to be treated like an adult. From Day 1 you're assumed  to be good at your job (as opposed to most at companies where you spend years trying to prove yourself) and your opinions are genuinely valued. It's a great place to grow and learn, and determine  your own career trajectory.","There is a lot to learn and get acclimated to when you first start. But there are so many resources and trainings that you're not left to your own devices.

Disappointed in the name change. In theory the general public know FB became Meta but they don't seem to make the connection when you say you work at Meta and it's not as impressive.

682,2,Total Chaos (not in a good way),"Salary and benefits were great — though salary is not that great any more with the stock down $200/share.

Some really great people who want to make the platform better and safer for the users.","So many people doing the same work across the company but since it’s a bottoms up culture no one is reigning in the chaos. Meta could do with A LOT less staff if they had any real leadership that required people to align and remove duplicative work.

Your work is thrashed all the time because of lack of leadership and strategic thinking/planning. If you are lucky, half of what you do will make it to the finish line. This is a huge concern when going for your annual review because you are calibrated with others and depending on how your manager sells your work (or doesn’t) will really affect your career and progression.

Most executives still prioritize “giving people voice” over addressing platform concerns and the negative impacts that the platforms can cause. They need to take issues more seriously.

There are A LOT of bad managers that can derail your career. Going to HR is useless because they are there to support the manager and limit risk to Meta. I can’t tell you how many people I worked with that took paid mental health leave because of their bad manager. If you get a bad manager get out the team ASAP because it will take them at least 12 months to work them out once they have enough complaints and that is long enough for them to destroy your career.

There is no way for you to dispute your review. Some of my colleagues received a poor review from their manager but the review included inaccurate or false information (they had documentation to prove it), but there is no formal process to dispute your review. A bad review could cost you your career or make it difficult for you to switch teams.

Leadership is leaving left and right which should raise some red flags. Metaverse is a big bet that will take years to pay off (if at all). How many people want to live in a virtual world? No thanks, I prefer to live in reality. Yes, there are benefits like training surgeons to do surgery before they touch a human but has anyone heard Mark mention using the metaverse that way?

750,5,Career-Changing Opportunity,"• Meta is an incredible place to gain experience, work (and network!) with people who are at the top of their fields, and grow your own skill set—IF you invest the effort and time to make it happen. 
• Many employees have the chance to work with people from all over the world, in an environment that encourages different perspectives. 
• I never thought someone like me would belong at a company like this—but I feel welcomed and encouraged, and I'm grateful to have learned so much (personally and professionally) from my coworkers. Never would've believed I'd feel this way while starting remotely during COVID, either!
• Most managers at Meta really want to be managers; folks aren't promoted just because it's the next most logical step in their career. In my experience, this means most managers are supportive, want to see you succeed, and are invested in helping you grow your career, not just in furthering their own agenda.
• Comp & benefits are amazing. WHY DID MY GUIDANCE COUNSELORS IN HIGH SCHOOL AND COLLEGE NOT TELL ME ABOUT RSUs??? That is all. 
• Having Meta on your resumé will open doors in a way that name dropping few other companies would.
• The support Meta provided throughout COVID has been exceptional, with flexibility and leave options that have helped me deal with remote learning, childcare gaps, and more. I've repeatedly told friends how lucky I have been to have joined Meta just before the pandemic.","• There are high expectations. ""Move fast"" isn't just a value — it's a description of how we work. If you like rigid work structures and aligning to predefined goals without questioning or re-assessing them as you progress, you probably won't thrive in the Meta environment. 
• Because of this constant flux, it can be hard to take PTO or maintain a consistently good work/life balance. This honestly depends on your team and manager, as well as how good you are at prioritizing. (Hint: Get comfortable saying no.)

Facebook encourages you to be yourself. Ironically, the company designed the office as a no-wall workspace policy, which you may find uncomfortable and lacking privacy.

Buffet-at-Work
The open workspace provides picnic-style tables, where you can sit shoulder-to-shoulder, with limited space, and gives no privacy. You will be rubbing elbows with colleagues… literally!

The Facebook Employee Stereotype
Most people expect Facebook employees to know everything on the site. You may still receive questions and hear complaints from people even outside the workplace.

Executives Who Discriminate
An anonymous former Facebook employee claimed he had his worst working experience in the company. He said higher-ups treats him like trash, gives him minimal guidance, and hands him inappropriate tasks such as sorting the director’s laundry.

The “Holier-Than-Thou” Attitude
One source complains that CEO and Facebook founder, Mark Zuckerberg and COO, Sheryl Sandberg are both self-righteous.

1144,1,Perks are great but atmosphere and management is toxic,"I worked for Facebook for 3 1/2 years. The perks are amazing, free food, free healthcare and the resources you have are the best.","Being a white male with a African American wife.....during my time at Facebook I was called racist, insensitive and bias. It was frustrating to go home and tell my wife instances at Facebook and then get her opinion saying I said or did nothing wrong. Over and over again I was looked at as the enemy when I had no intention of hurting anyone. 

Being a white male at Facebook you are looked at as the problem and reason that is bringing a certain race or ethnicity down. During my bi annual review I was told by my Asian manager to work on toning down ""Your White privilege"" during meetings. Excuse me? If my wife had a manager that asked or accused her of taking advantage of the fact she's black there would be lawsuit. 

I am not a racist, I or my parents, grandparents or great grandparents have never enslaved anyone. In my eyes everyone is the same and deserves a fair shot, but at the end of the day all white people are not bad and allowing people to blatantly accuse you of being racist without repercussion is what Facebook 100% supports and at times promotes though the classes you have to take as a employee.

Facebook has a policy that someone of color should be interviewed for every position, which is fine but I witnessed several times Asian and African American managers completely ignore someone who was white and more qualified and gave the job to someone of their own ethnicity. Out of the 10 times I saw that happen, 7 of those people were eventually fired cause they just couldn't do the job.

In summary, this attitude that white people are the root reason why every other ethnicity experiences problems is just flat out sad. Then it is taught and supported by companies like Facebook, which only separates us further. Out of any group there are bad apples, but that is no reason to come up with a blanket opinion and then teach that from generation to generation, that is the exact opposite of progression and being united.

A direct quote from my father in law (Who is black) ""Above being just black, more importantly I am an American, where you can make anything of yourself if you stop coming up with excuses and just get to work, white people are not the problem and we need to stop teaching our kids that they are"".",Digital Marketing Manager,Former Employee,"Menlo Park, CA","Nov 18, 2021"

You can almost live on campus. I guess I mostly spent on rent and gas. Free food, showers, gym, ~700 dollars on external wellness activity, paternity leave, and lots of small perks to simplify your life.

FB fosters quite a friendly culture. At least, on the level of engineers. Semiannual reviews partially evaluate how good your relationships with the colleagues.

FB is very good at employee retention. Management will try hard to find interesting projects for you. Lots of projects that may bring a great impact. Quite unique projects at scale. 

Lots of pocket communities with interesting activities.

Good compensation.","Lots of big politics around the company. There is always pressure from the government, society, the media, and even from own employees represented by a vocal left-leaning group. You will also get the part of this pressure as an employee.

You can be working on the number 1 goal or project from Jan - June and knock it out of the park. Then by July everyone's attention has shifted and your work is no longer relevant. A lot of institutional knowledge is lost this way. 

The company skews young as well, so there are a lot of inexperienced people who want to make their mark/get their promotions and they work hard but don't get the guidance that would help them work smarter. The result is that some teams take ""done is better than perfect"" and ""ask for forgiveness rather than permission"" to another level, which can make work tedious. Almost everyone comes from elite schools and has great stats so some really lean in extra hard into making themselves stand out, sometimes in ways that aren't the most useful or healthy.

- From the git-go, there wasn't even honesty about the job description, or even title, during the job interview. On my second day I learned that the position had a different name and dept than what I had been told. 
- There was absolutely no training for a highly complex role. We were just told to read the wikis. Except that a lot of things didn't exist in the wikis and you just had to go at it and hope it worked, and that any mistakes wouldn't set your projects back too much. 
- Despite the above, there was absolutely no leniency for taking a bit longer on your first projects. You were held to the same timelines as other team members that had been there months or years. 
- You were also held to the same timelines despite rapid changes being implemented to the system that caused weeks-long delays (e.g. longer review processes.) Somehow you were just supposed to compensate for them. 
- Expectations were not made clear at all - you didn't know you were failing at something until you were being told you could loose your job. 
- Rabid management that provided no support to you. The only purpose of my weekly meeting with my team lead was to be reminded that I could loose my job if I didn't produce enough. The manager would routinely flip out during team meetings and put a team members' position in question - in front of the entire team - for the smallest of mistakes.

While I'm excited to see more roles open up in Facebook for creatives, I worry that it affords teams and management opportunities to hire more white people. Instead of bringing in someone with a different experience that is talented and deserving of an opportunity. Sadly, I've seen BIPOC candidates get shortlisted, only to not make the cut for arbitrary reasons. 'Not a good fit' is a poor reason for someone who spent the time interviewing with us with a stella portfolio. I worry that teams are only bringing in certain candidates to meet some sort of quota or to appear ""exhaustive"" in their search, just so that they can hire another white person.

Creative teams across the company are very white, and mostly male. While I'm excited to see more roles open up in Facebook for creatives, I worry that it affords teams and management opportunities to hire more white people. Instead of bringing in someone with a different experience that is talented and deserving of an opportunity. Sadly, I've seen BIPOC candidates get shortlisted, only to not make the cut for arbitrary reasons. 'Not a good fit' is a poor reason for someone who spent the time interviewing with us with a stella portfolio. I worry that teams are only bringing in certain candidates to meet some sort of quota or to appear ""exhaustive"" in their search, just so that they can hire another white person. I'm tried of observing these performative acts of diversity from creative leaders across teams and hope that this changes.

1822,2,Publicity skills are more important than Engineering,"Great pay, perks, benefits and cool offices. Friendly people (at least on the surface)","What I find most annoying and frustrating (found other IC4 or 3 DEs also share the same frustration) are: 
1 - The role: Like someone else mentioned I can’t see why we have ‘engineer’ in our title. It’s like 80% of your day goes about project management, expectation management, navigating team and product priorities, finding work for yourself and just what you need to do next. Then keeping others and yourself updated about what’s going on. When you can get a break from constant meetings and notifications and pings in chat then you can get some work done (Hello overtime). Also put aside time for advertising yourself, writing posts about what great things you are going to do, doing now, and have already done. Add a ton of stress on top of that for delivering IMPACT and constantly wondering if what you are doing is going to create enough noise to get you somewhere.
2 - Lack of well defined projects: you have to put in so much time and energy just to find something to work on. It’s like a manager decides they need some more headcount on their the team and hire the person and then tell them I don’t know what you need to do but there’s something out there for sure, go find out! Good for you if you can find or define a new impactful project, otherwise take on someone else’s work which they abandoned for something with more IMPACT or start working on some product that’s not going anywhere but some vp cares about.

Other things to consider: 
- The role : Data Engineers at FB are in a tough position. Usually noone in other roles really know what you are supposed to do, even DEs themselves will have a bootcamp course to tell them what they are supposed to do. As such you are always in the position of pushing back on requests, trying to define what you should do, or seeking to do the job someone else is already doing but in a better way. If you fail to push back you’ll be flooded with meaningless work (adhoc requests).

Other cons:
- Lack of Knowledge sharing and documentation: A piece of info you seek could be in a post on workplace, stored on some random quip, a file on dropbox, a sheet on google drive, or some random wiki page. And when you find it you can never trust what you see because it is possibly wrong or already outdated. Better to directly ask someone and hope they have the correct answer to your question. Enjoy waiting for responses or not finding any available time on their calendar to book a meeting.

-Moving Fast= Tons of junk: Moving fast to deliver short term impact has plagued the analytics org with tons of garbage. Noone cares about optimizing their solutions or documenting their work, and when they get credit for the IMPACT they move on to the next thing. Good luck if you inherit someone’s work which you need to make sense of on your own.",Data Engineer,Current Employee,"Menlo Park, CA","Mar 12, 2021"

2038,5,Extensive Support and Brilliant Coworkers,"One of the biggest perks is working with some of the most intelligent, thoughtful and honest coworkers anywhere in the world. No matter how big of a fish you have been in previous ponds, you will be a small fish here and have incredible space to grow. There is incredible freedom to pursue the projects you want in the way that you want as long as you can defend why they are important to the company. While less than it was in the past, there is incredible transparency and accountability from leadership internally. Your manager will support and promote you in a way that is unprecedented at most other companies. Most importantly, the work you do affects millions or billions of people - even seemingly tiny tasks like making the app update 1 second faster or tweaking a model to deliver 1% more interesting content can have a large positive impact on the world. While it doesn't always succeed, the company takes diversity and social justice seriously and it shows in project initiatives and hiring.","It's a big company with entrenched (if sometimes informal) power structures. As much as people try to be transparent, there are backdoor politics that affect your role and career that you might not learn about until much later, if ever. There will be constant pressure to specialize - many of the new skills I've developed here would transfer well to other big tech companies, but be wasted at a startup. Work life balance can go sideways quickly unless you protect yourself zealously. Even in the ""move fast (and we no longer say 'break things')"" culture there is a lot of pressure to not mess up in ways that affect the public negatively - even small mistakes in privacy or integrity have terrible negative effects on potentially millions of people.",Research Scientist,Current Employee,"New York, NY","Sep 28, 2020"

- Impact. Unlike SWE, who can prove their impacts by finishing pre-planned coding projects and rolling out pre-planned features, data scientist does not automatically get credit if you only finish beautiful analyses. You have to suggest eng team to apply your suggestion from analysis, and prove how much of the product growth are from your analysis. So sometimes your impact can be subjective.

- Skillset. You may be asked to do a lot of ad-hoc analyses from eng team, which I am sure are very important and can guide engineers whether to implement certain features, but that will prevent you from doing some deep dive analyses and learning some new techniques in data analysis. Maybe after a year or two, you will find that you did not build any statistical models or haven't touched any machine learning. But that's the skillset what other companies will ask for when you apply new job. Who cares you did how many ad-hoc analyses or AB test or wrote how many data pipelines.

2210,5,Amazing for female engineers,"I'm a software engineer who has been at Facebook for almost a year. It is hands down the best place I have ever worked.

To be frank, I didn't have high expectations going in that it would be very different from the misogynistic cultures I've had to navigate at previous companies. 

Before working at Facebook, I'd kind of come to accept that being a female engineer would always be a somewhat isolating existence and the best I could do would be to find a team with 90% great colleagues and just try and avoid the creepy and rude ones as much as possible. I'd seen that as long as they performed well (or held some other utilitarian value for the company) they would always have a place in a company and their treatment of women would be an open secret and accepted.

Honestly, my first couple months at Facebook made me aware of how much effort I'd been spending navigating those types of situations.

It's incredible working with people who assume your competence rather than constantly having to battle to prove yourself.

It's amazing seeing constant efforts towards dissecting internalized biases and senior male employees openly discussing their efforts to catch themselves unconsciously interrupting people. It's laughable to try to imagine this happening at my previous companies.

2434,5,"Amazing scale, pace and culture","I'm coming up to the end of my first quarter and continue to be blown away by how fast we can move, even compared to tiny startups.  The engineering culture is aligned to enabling you to try things out, get things done and get them shipped out at an amazing rate.  The perks are amazing and the management structure feels flat and low friction.  Lots of smart folks and plenty of opportunities to get stuck into different areas if you feel like a change.

Work/life balance is good; lots of encouragement to take a break when you need it with a pretty high frequency of offsite events, and flexible working hours.

The onboarding process is very well put together: culture infusion from the moment you walk in the door, and you're mentored through a six week bootcamp and can be pushing code out to the website in your first week.","The flip side of the low friction management structure is that you need to take on more ownership of finding high impact work--don't expect to handed out work, you need to identify the work and then get it done.  I see this as a plus, but it can make it a little difficult when you start out.

Having a high density of smart folks can make it feel more competitive than it really is, and that combined with the pretty low average age of employees can result in the occasional abrasive conversation.

Being privy to the roadmap and our plans overall but not being able to tell people about it when they interpret our steps towards our grand vision in a negative light can be frustrating.",Software Engineer,Current Employee,"Menlo Park, CA","Sep 2, 2012"

2439,5,Small Team with Great Career Opportunity,"I joined as an Enterprise Engineer and quickly became the manager after working with the engineers to boost productivity and overall happiness on the team.

Everyone on the team is motivated, talented and open to new ways of work.  The team is very collaborative and flexible.  This makes everyone very good to work with - we all want to achieve great results while maintaining good work/life balance.

We get the opportunity to work on very impactful projects.  In our area we support the efficient and accurate payment of many billions of dollars per year.  It's a great responsibility.

One of the great things I love is being able to work on software engineering projects in Austin for Facebook.  While they don't officially allow software engineers in Austin at Facebook, Enterprise Engineering work is super close to the work I did previously as a software engineer at Facebook in Seattle.

The growth in Austin for Enterprise Engineering is also a great opportunity for me and my team - we get to be the ones determining the work culture here for engineering.","Ramping up within the domain takes some time.  I wasn't immediately knowledgeable about things like the general ledger, period close, accruals, balance sheets and the like.  While these may not be the most interesting topics, I do enjoying how my work reduces the tedium involved and makes sure the Facebook business runs smoothly.

As a remote office, we do have to sometimes coordinate across time zones.  It's not often, but sometimes it does require meeting in the evening.

2524,5,"Amazing scale, pace and culture","I'm coming up to the end of my first quarter and continue to be blown away by how fast we can move, even compared to tiny startups.  The engineering culture is aligned to enabling you to try things out, get things done and get them shipped out at an amazing rate.  The perks are amazing and the management structure feels flat and low friction.  Lots of smart folks and plenty of opportunities to get stuck into different areas if you feel like a change.

Work/life balance is good; lots of encouragement to take a break when you need it with a pretty high frequency of offsite events, and flexible working hours.

The onboarding process is very well put together: culture infusion from the moment you walk in the door, and you're mentored through a six week bootcamp and can be pushing code out to the website in your first week.","The flip side of the low friction management structure is that you need to take on more ownership of finding high impact work--don't expect to handed out work, you need to identify the work and then get it done.  I see this as a plus, but it can make it a little difficult when you start out.

Having a high density of smart folks can make it feel more competitive than it really is, and that combined with the pretty low average age of employees can result in the occasional abrasive conversation.

Being privy to the roadmap and our plans overall but not being able to tell people about it when they interpret our steps towards our grand vision in a negative light can be frustrating.",Software Engineer,Current Employee,"Menlo Park, CA","Sep 2, 2012"

We get the opportunity to work on very impactful projects.  In our area we support the efficient and accurate payment of many billions of dollars per year.  It's a great responsibility.

One of the great things I love is being able to work on software engineering projects in Austin for Facebook.  While they don't officially allow software engineers in Austin at Facebook, Enterprise Engineering work is super close to the work I did previously as a software engineer at Facebook in Seattle.

The growth in Austin for Enterprise Engineering is also a great opportunity for me and my team - we get to be the ones determining the work culture here for engineering.","Ramping up within the domain takes some time.  I wasn't immediately knowledgeable about things like the general ledger, period close, accruals, balance sheets and the like.  While these may not be the most interesting topics, I do enjoying how my work reduces the tedium involved and makes sure the Facebook business runs smoothly.

As a remote office, we do have to sometimes coordinate across time zones.  It's not often, but sometimes it does require meeting in the evening.

2540,5,What a great place to work,"There are many, but here are a few of my favorites:

- Play to your strengths. Too many companies and too many people work on improving weaknesses, in hopes of becoming well-rounded. This is fine, but often the better strategy is to play to your strengths, where employees do more of what they're good at, and less of what they're not good at, in a diverse team. I've never seen this done as well as at Facebook.

- Moving fast at scale. There are so many tools and frameworks to help you still move fast, as fast as any startup, that's it awesome. So impressive at Facebook's scale.

- World-class team. I know this is said often and loses meaning, but it's true here. Every single person is both smart and nice, a rare combination.

- They care about the right things, and don't care about the wrong things. Both parts of this are important. Too many companies sweat the small stuff that doesn't matter, e.g. who's invited to a meeting or whatever. At Facebook, everyone is just trying to make a positive impact, without care for politics etc.","- Things change fast. If you're not at ease with change, or if you're seeking a place that never changes, this is not the right company for you. This includes projects, tools, technologies, teams...

If I were to pick one pro out of all of them - it's the people. Whatever you heard or read about Facebook really doesn't give the place enough credit. I'm not in HR/recruiting or even management, but I do see a common trend in everyone they bring on board. Everyone is smart, motivated, non-judgemental, and freakishly CARING. There are so many people with heart at FB.

To be honest, you can be one heck of a coder, but if you're selfish - I don't think you will get hired here. I've previously worked at Google and MSFT; FB blows both of them out of the water (maybe I'm a little biased). Other pro's of course are...

I was told the Product Support role would be a precursor to Product Management and that you will be spending a lot of time strategizing and helping product teams with their product roadmaps. A couple weeks in, and I soon realized that this role is purely operational and SLA based. We manned bug reports on a daily basis. Everything was numbers driven, but not in the right way. We were encouraged to analyze the tickets to find ways to improve SLA. 

Leadership is quite weak. They only listen to our goals and aspirations but neither help us or nor point us to the right direction. Most of the team don't plan to stay for long. Everyone seems to have a plan B or to be using this role as a springboard to another one within Facebook.

2555,5,The experience of a lifetime,"I left Google due to all the red tape, process, communication difficulties across teams and depts, etc.  Facebook will undoubtedly face these challenges as well as they grow, but at this current stage, they've taken more of an open, ""move fast and break things"" approach.  I love the freedom given to explore, share, collaborate, and HACK.  I didn't feel I had much of this freedom at Google - and there is much less (pretty much none) of the ""Engineer vs. Everyone else"" caste system that Google is famous for.

I am incredibly relieved, and satisfied, that I made the jump.  I've been at many of silicon valley's top tier companies in my 15 years here in SV.  After 15 years here, I have a pretty strong idea of what I want and what I don't want - so I can say with confidence that Facebook is my lifer job - I plan on staying here a WHILE.","The speed at which things move here can be daunting for the uninitiated, but if you've been at top tier companies before, it's nothing unique.

Most everyone is incredibly helpful.","Moving fast doesn't always mean doing it right - While you're pretty much allowed to try anything, as a large company, we should slow down and mature some of the processes in order to maintain a high quality of shipped products as opposed to letting the culture of ""fail fast"" cause duplicate work.",Technical Project Manager,Current Employee,"Menlo Park, CA","Mar 26, 2014"
2587,2,Not for Everyone,Perks & pay are top notch. Some of the engineers are truly talented.,"As the title says, FB is not for everybody IMO. The recent set of 1-star ratings list pretty much all the things that made me leave: questionable work-life-balance, no planning/structure, arrogant/ignorant coworkers, every man for himself/every woman for herself, cliques, political, inept managers, poor communication/rumor mill/back-stabbing, no teamwork, management by attention-deficit disorder.

The work-life-balance issue goes beyond the mere hours: it is expected that you become FB friends with all your coworkers, managers, etc. FB makes it impossible for the realm of your private life to remain separate from your workplace and coworkers. This wasn't working for me, but I recognize that for others this isn't an issue.

It seemed to me that much that is broken at FB is perpetuated by the in-clique and in fact gets sold as the great achievements of FB's unique culture.",Software Engineer,Former Employee,"Menlo Park, CA","Apr 12, 2015"

It's a place to explore your passions with classes in the arts, a music room, running clubs, health center, etc. Everything is at your fingertips.","The recruiting team here is over 1000+ people and going up. Like someone else mentioned, the quality of hires for the recruiting team is worsening. The R4R team is so desperate to hit their goal that the bar is low and it shows. There are many new inexperienced recruiters that we just wish would or COULD do their basic, functional job. 

The role of a sourcer and recruiter is becoming smaller and smaller. And although leadership insists they care, every action they take suggests they do not. It is hard to constantly be reminded that you are merely just another number to be replaced asap. 

Be prepared to work long, long hours. There isn't such a thing as ""work/life"" balance as most in recruiting will work into the night and weekends. The goals and expectations are extremely high so you're constantly competing with a whole org of overachievers. Realistically, this means it'll be tough to even achieve a ""Meets All"" rating during the review cycle as everyone is overachieving, thereby changing that already high goal.",Technical Recruiter,Current Employee,"Menlo Park, CA","Feb 4, 2018"

2602,5,Lots to dive into!,"I really like the pace that we're working at -- there's so much going on, and there's a lot of inherent trust in people to run with what they're doing.  Policies and red tape in previous companies sometimes left me feeling a bit stifled about what I was able to work on & share, but there really is a sense of openness at Facebook, not only in communication, but in the ability to jump into projects that call out to you as well.

And beyond that, the people really are incredible: smart, fun, unique, and passionate about what they're doing.  It's hard not to get excited by the people alone!","The pace *can* be a little crazy -- one of our values is moving fast, and we definitely do that -- and generally that's a huge pro to working here, but at times, it can be a little much.  There are definitely good policies around PTO, and the environment *is* understanding about balancing work & personal life, but that's ultimately up to the individual to carry out, which can be difficult to do in practice.",Business Analyst,Current Employee,"Palo Alto, CA","Oct 8, 2010"
2603,5,The best job I've ever had,"They grill you hard in the interview but once you're in, you get a lot of autonomy and freedom to make decisions about how you think things should be done. Zero bureaucracy/red tape, very few meetings, and people are encouraged to build what they think will work. Two of the common sayings there are ""code wins arguments"" and ""what does the data say?"" meaning that if people disagree about something, the debate gets resolved by looking at numerical data and/or by building something and seeing whether or not it works. This is a very fast, turn-on-a-dime, high productivity, zero BS environment. It's also a lot of fun to work there. People work hard and play hard.","The cons at Facebook mostly fall under the heading of ""growing pains"". 

Technologically, things move so fast that the layers of the technology stack are often in flux. If you are building a system that depends on other systems at FB, be ready for them to change underneath you. Nothing stays the same for long at Facebook. Every layer of the stack changes, and changes quickly. 

At the human level, the company has also grown very quickly which means many of the lower level managers are new or inexperienced or got promoted to management for being good with computers (but not necessarily with people). It can be frustrating to report to junior managers and/or people who are clueless about social skills. With that said, the higher level, more senior managers tend to be really good and their skill often ""trickles down"" in various ways.",Production Engineer,Current Employee,"Menlo Park, CA","Aug 29, 2012"

High level of independence and reliance on individuals doing what they see as the best use of their talents for the company (with guidance from managers and others if needed). Each team is a little different in how they operate, but because you can pick your team after you join (and have gone through bootcamp and met many of them), you can find the fit that matches you. And if you find you need a change at some point, then you just find the next team/project (or come up with your own) that again satisfies you and helps the company as much as possible.

The perks are awesome. Free food, snacks. Lots of variety, high quality. Great benefits - I'm a big fan of the onsite medical/dental options. It's a company that cares about its employees and you can feel it imo.

2629,5,A corporation for entrepreneurs,"I've been at Facebook for 7 months now as a Product Manager after 3 years as an entrepreneur and a freelance product and growth consultant. I've noticed the following:

1) The company embodies ""move fast"". If you can prove you can create a vision and build momentum for a product and a team, you will be given the reins to move as fast as you can at FB. I've taken a project from 0 to 1 to launch in 4 countries in 4 months.

2) The company embodies ""be bold"". There are no ""small swings"" around here. There might be a lot of incremental work, optimization and tweaking on all fronts but when the company realizes progress needs to be done in an area, it's no holds barred. The big bet I'm currently leading has lead to 2 teams merging and org structures adapting to enable that shift.

3) The company embodies ""be open"" - There is a transparency to the decision making, be it at team level or at management and leadership level I've never encountered before. It's refreshing to be able to ask any question I want to Mark every Friday during the Q&A for instance.","One thing has underwhelmed me and that is that management isn't as available as I wish it would be.

- Great people!  ""Brilliant jerk"" behavior, as seen in these kinds of companies, is generally less tolerated/prevalent here than elsewhere

Coworkers are peers of all ages and backgrounds which makes for a unique dynamic around the office,"Biggest common issue over my 1 year here: They don't practice what they preach (ie. Culture and work/life balance opportunities). The management team looks down on everyone. No one can advance beyond an entry level position. You get an idea that gets bought or get stuck in an entry level type job for your ""career"" with barely above avg pay rates. I know that this is a competitive industry but sometimes the stupid people win just because they have the right connection. Bad employees stay while realistic workers realize the mistreatment and all leave within a year. I'm not making this up. Go look up Facebook's overall turnover ratio and tell me how that could lead to happy employees. Every SINGLE person on my initial project was lied to about their working hours (expect 9-5 and told 9-5 then made work overnight/graveyard shifts), benefits (only get to go on campus when with a supervisor), and team management.

2697,5,A corporation for entrepreneurs,"I've been at Facebook for 7 months now as a Product Manager after 3 years as an entrepreneur and a freelance product and growth consultant. I've noticed the following:

1) The company embodies ""move fast"". If you can prove you can create a vision and build momentum for a product and a team, you will be given the reins to move as fast as you can at FB. I've taken a project from 0 to 1 to launch in 4 countries in 4 months.

2) The company embodies ""be bold"". There are no ""small swings"" around here. There might be a lot of incremental work, optimization and tweaking on all fronts but when the company realizes progress needs to be done in an area, it's no holds barred. The big bet I'm currently leading has lead to 2 teams merging and org structures adapting to enable that shift.

3) The company embodies ""be open"" - There is a transparency to the decision making, be it at team level or at management and leadership level I've never encountered before. It's refreshing to be able to ask any question I want to Mark every Friday during the Q&A for instance.","One thing has underwhelmed me and that is that management isn't as available as I wish it would be.

2729,2,"Not for everyone, hypocracy and blame I saw mostly","Lovely campus, okay perks for contract workers.","The HR/training teams that I worked with were staffed by people that thougt they were experts. They indicated that no contractors could ever offer value; contractors were viewed as an extra pair of hands. However, my role was specifically to provide expertise and coaching in my domain area. The junior/mid-level staff never solicited feedback and assumed only their ideas were useful. Just because people say they are open to feedback does not make it so. I got unsolicited feedback constantly at FB: everyone has an opinion and thinks it's valuable. But, not once did anyone ever ask for my feedback. In that sense, and many others, it's a hypocritical environment. 

If you're junior or less than 15 years in your job, FB is probably a good place to grow. If you're more experienced, be sure you carefully evaluate the job. My experience is that I wasn't working with the best or brightest, more often they were the narrow-minded, arrogant and entitled.

- Fast pace!  Some view this as a con, but if you are high-energy and easily bored like me, this is ideal.  Plus, this includes fast career growth.  If you can perform, you will be rewarded quickly.
- Great people!  ""Brilliant jerk"" behavior, as seen in these kinds of companies, is generally less tolerated/prevalent here than elsewhere
- Generally best engineering pay among big-tech employers

- Top-class benefits (including INSANE parental benefits)

This can be a bit trying when you just want to get your job done and your friends and family are bugging you about the latest features added (or not added).",Engineering Manager,Current Employee,"Menlo Park, CA","Nov 19, 2012"

I was told the Product Support role would be a precursor to Product Management and that you will be spending a lot of time strategizing and helping product teams with their product roadmaps. A couple weeks in, and I soon realized that this role is purely operational and SLA based. We manned bug reports on a daily basis. Everything was numbers driven, but not in the right way. We were encouraged to analyze the tickets to find ways to improve SLA. 

Leadership is quite weak. They only listen to our goals and aspirations but neither help us or nor point us to the right direction. Most of the team don't plan to stay for long. Everyone seems to have a plan B or to be using this role as a springboard to another one within Facebook.

If you have a great idea and can convince others to join you, there is very little process stopping you from building awesome new stuff and shipping it to the world.  Practically everyone I know, and everyone I meet, has used the software that I've written.

The company culture and values are amazing and everyone is totally on board with them.  There is no politics or infighting and everyone is really on the same team trying to make facebook better.

Facebookers are extremely smart people and super passionate about their work.  We aren't afraid to take on new risks or big challenges.

The technology stack is mind boggling.  When I started at facebook a few years ago, every day I learned something that made my jaw drop.  The same thing still happens to me on a regular basis years later.

Company culture is so, so good. I've had two great managers who both have done an excellent job supporting my growth and guiding my career.

It also feels like senior and C-level management really cares about employees. It feels like Facebook the company really tries to support me as a whole person (but be sure to ask for what you need! nobody's a mind reader).

For eng, bootcamp and team selection are such a good idea. I freaking love my team, and I get to own my decision to join that team (rather than some hiring/allocation manager deciding where I get to go).

Very few operational rules/bureaucracy. I can ssh into any machine I need to. If someone's fighting a fire anywhere in the company and I am able to help, I feel like I can always jump in to help.

The work-life-balance issue goes beyond the mere hours: it is expected that you become FB friends with all your coworkers, managers, etc. FB makes it impossible for the realm of your private life to remain separate from your workplace and coworkers. This wasn't working for me, but I recognize that for others this isn't an issue.

Practically everyone I know, and everyone I meet, has used the software that I've written.

The company culture and values are amazing and everyone is totally on board with them.  There is no politics or infighting and everyone is really on the same team trying to make facebook better.

Facebookers are extremely smart people and super passionate about their work.  We aren't afraid to take on new risks or big challenges.

The technology stack is mind boggling.  When I started at facebook a few years ago, every day I learned something that made my jaw drop.  The same thing still happens to me on a regular basis years later.

Mark and Sheryl make a great pair of leaders that I have the utmost confidence in.

There are excellent learning and development programs/opportunities that help you progress in your career.

2833,5,A mature culture of smart people working on the hardest and most rewarding problems,"The Culture:
This tops the list of reasons to work at Facebook.  Many companies say they take their culture seriously but Facebook lives it. The mantras and propaganda around the office really do help you ""stay focused and keep shipping"", by clearing away your own barriers and resolving debates.

The Impact:
My first day on the job I submitted a diff that now hundreds of millions of people see every day.  Imagining a more connected world keeps me coming in every day, because I know that I'm building that future.

The Career Opportunities:
There is no arbitrary ladder, no game mechanics, at Facebook.  Your career grows as you hack larger things.  Because you are encouraged to work across Facebook, jumping teams and technologies, you gain a variety of skills that keeps you agile and flexible.  And because Facebook is built on a lot of open source technologies, the skills you gain here are easily transferable everywhere.","Work / Life balance:
If you want to spend most of your time with your family, and work is just a job to you look elsewhere. No one keeps track of your time, but if you want to do well here you'll spend a lot of your free time thinking about the problems you're tackling.",Software Engineer,Current Employee,"Menlo Park, CA","Nov 19, 2012"

- Lots of resources to learn - 7 months into my job and I feel I am already a much better engineer.
- Lots of importance on what YOU want to work on, versus what your manager thinks you should work on. You can freely talk to your manager and find an intersection between your interests and the company/product needs.
- Everything is automated (again by rockstar teams), and processes are made as simple as possible.
- Great pay, stocks and bonuses.
- Amazing perks! Lots of food choices, great campus, regular team happy hours with great food, and the list goes on and on.","- Work-life balance almost 0 on weekdays!

* Amazing food. We get breakfast, lunch, snack, and dinner served up by the best chefs around. Menus change daily and my favorite to date has been the Willy Wonka themed lunch menu. Sushi day is legit too.

I worry that I may never find such a great work environment again.","Work/life balance is great at Facebook, IF your entire life is Facebook.

The culture is also sink or swim which given the caliber of person they bring in and how many people they have to pick from, is crazy.  why would you bring in that level of talent and then let her/him flounder?

2841,2,"Not for everyone, hypocracy and blame I saw mostly","Lovely campus, okay perks for contract workers.","The HR/training teams that I worked with were staffed by people that thougt they were experts. They indicated that no contractors could ever offer value; contractors were viewed as an extra pair of hands. However, my role was specifically to provide expertise and coaching in my domain area. The junior/mid-level staff never solicited feedback and assumed only their ideas were useful. Just because people say they are open to feedback does not make it so. I got unsolicited feedback constantly at FB: everyone has an opinion and thinks it's valuable. But, not once did anyone ever ask for my feedback. In that sense, and many others, it's a hypocritical environment. 

If you're junior or less than 15 years in your job, FB is probably a good place to grow. If you're more experienced, be sure you carefully evaluate the job. My experience is that I wasn't working with the best or brightest, more often they were the narrow-minded, arrogant and entitled.

Finally, in the area I worked, it was all about blame and pointing fingers when things went wrong. And because they hate processes, of course things would go wrong.","Manager, Specific Contract Services",Former Employee,"Mountain View, CA","Oct 21, 2015"

People who make a big impact are recognized and rewarded, regardless of their job title or level of experience. The company's leadership truly believes in Facebook's mission to make the world more open and connected. Teams are small and have a lot of autonomy, and it's amazing to see how much of a difference a single person can make at this place.",The downside having so much going on all at once is that it takes energy and discipline to stay focused on those things that matter most.

However, because Facebook hires strong talent at EVERY position, in some cases where strong talent is hired in positions that aren't core to the success of the business (read: if you're not an engineer, product manager, or maayyyybeeee a key sales person), it can be frustrating as your job is just not that important to the company's success.

2) It's easy for engineers to switch teams. That means you don't need to know what you enjoy working on before you join and you can't get stuck with a bad manager.
3) New York-specific: the company is in East Village, which means you can live in the most exciting part of the city AND have the luxury of walking to work.
4) I think Facebook's company history is interesting.
5) Facebook's language infrastructure is phenomenal. Its PHP and Javascript is type-checked, which makes it so much easier to read without typeof checks everywhere.","1) New York-specific: There's about 15 different engineering teams to choose from, which can be a deal breaker if your heart is already set on a particular team we don't have.",Software Engineer,Current Employee,"New York, NY","Feb 5, 2017"

Makes it hard to discuss ideas or work collaboratively without fear that your ideas will get stolen.  I guess it's part of moving fast and breaking things. Also, propaganda posters decorate all the buildings. They're there for inspiration but it felt more like cultish brainwashing. My opinions could be because I was older than about 92% or the population at Menlo Park which skews toward college grads and under 30s.

2879,5,Facebook set me up for success,"Facebook is a top tech company like Google, LinkedIn, Apple and many others. All of these companies offer basically the same thing: great engineers, good money, free food, impacting zillions of people and interesting tech problems. Facebook has a few things that set it apart:

1. Open-ness. Root on every box, access to every source repo. I very rarely had to wait to receive credentials to do anything. At other jobs you're often blocked sitting at your desk for a few days waiting for access to some repository.

2. Control over your career. You don't get hired into a specific team -- you choose it (in recent years they've added a list of teams you can choose from, but there's still a lot of variety). And if you get bored or feel stalled, you're encouraged to switch teams.

I don't think other companies offer those things. The real list of pros is huge, but since they could be applied to other companies I don't include them here.

The only reason I left is because I always wanted to start my own startup. Otherwise I would have stayed forever.","With everyone switching teams all the time there is often a lot of lost tribal knowledge. So there's parts of the codebase that no one understands anymore.

Since the Great Shift to Mobile there's been a focus on quality at the expense of moving fast. I really liked the Move Fast and Break Things mentality of Facebook when I joined, and though people disagree with me, I prefer it to the ""don't ship it until it's perfect"" mentality (I think many of the independent Facebook apps waited too long to launch).

Another thing that no one will agree with me on is the work-life balance. I have noticed a trend of people working less, hackathons running during the day, etc. I think your average employee is less driven and moves slower than a few years ago. This used to be a place where people were obsessed with shipping above all else. It isn't that anymore. This is a pro for some people but not for me.

- I've learned an incredible amount about a new tech stack and product management for ads in only a few months. Not all my peers are brilliant about all things (which is good, as I'm certainly not) but every one of them is smarter than I am about at least one thing, and it takes very little time to find out what. 

- Data and logic rule here -- not always, not entirely, but enough. There is enough of a culture of rigor to metrics that we still have a North Star when in the weeds.

- The perks are great. I have gotten broken glasses fixed by the dry cleaner for only a low tax rate. The food is shockingly good for the scale of the cafes, and I'm impressed every day by the whole MPK service operation.

- Workplace is much better than emails as a site for debate/discussion about what to do. Also a con, because it generates a game  of how-should-i-react-on-Workplace all its own, and in a more public record.","Facebook is like Bitcoin: people in it ask when you bought in because it's the easiest way to find out how powerful you are without being rude. 

I joined within the last year, along with about half of the company. The contrast in the level of success of people who joined N years ago vs N-2 years ago is logarithmic for all values of N. At its current rate, I don't think I can advise anyone to join now, and after I vest, I'm not sure I will stay.

Part of this is that the starting comp isn't  very good. The vesting stock is, but the cash is fairly mediocre (less than previous jobs I've had at far less profitable companies), and vesting accelerates over time. This nets to you being paid much more than before, year over year.

The much greater share of it is that opportunities scaling in  the same pyramid-growth path means that anyone thinking of joining today can't expect  any of the same trajectory that available 2 years ago, and maybe even 1 year ago.",Senior Product Manager,Current Employee,"Menlo Park, CA","Dec 7, 2017"

If there was no downside (which there is), I would give this company a rating of 5 stars hands down.","Facebook is still in its teenage years of development.  While many HR processes & policies are mature (the hiring process is best I've seen), fraternization is overlooked (aka sex between coworkers, sometimes even in the office itself) and relationships within chain of command are accepted/overlooked - yet don't dare say ""pimp my ride"" in an open space as you will get your hands slapped.",Anonymous Employee,Current Employee,"Menlo Park, CA","Jun 8, 2014"

2) It's easy for engineers to switch teams. That means you don't need to know what you enjoy working on before you join and you can't get stuck with a bad manager.
3) New York-specific: the company is in East Village, which means you can live in the most exciting part of the city AND have the luxury of walking to work.
4) I think Facebook's company history is interesting.
5) Facebook's language infrastructure is phenomenal. Its PHP and Javascript is type-checked, which makes it so much easier to read without typeof checks everywhere.","1) New York-specific: There's about 15 different engineering teams to choose from, which can be a deal breaker if your heart is already set on a particular team we don't have.",Software Engineer,Current Employee,"New York, NY","Feb 5, 2017"

Also, propaganda posters decorate all the buildings. They're there for inspiration but it felt more like cultish brainwashing. My opinions could be because I was older than about 92% or the population at Menlo Park which skews toward college grads and under 30s.

Things move really fast - there usually has to be a good reason not to do some new cool thing, instead of a reason to do it.","Since so many people at Facebook are amazing, recognition/awards aren't as frequent as I'd personally like.

I've done stuff that would've earned me instant promotions at a previous company, and only got a ""cool, nice job"" at Facebook.

2956,5,Facebook,"I've been at Facebook for about a year and a half and it is the first company i've worked for that's truly walked the walk in terms of standing by it's mission and values. The people that I work with care deeply about their users and about the company as a whole and Facebook cares deeply and invests in those employees as well. The problems are large scale and complex, but the people working to solve them are the best of the best. I come to work everyday and enjoy my job, I feel appreciated, secure in my role, and that I personally make an impact every day. It's a rare feeling.

2957,2,"Smart, boring people and no balance.","The people are smart, and the scaling challenges are great. Where else does your code impact a billion people? The compensation is amazing.

Senior management are generally amazing people, smart, visionary and compassionate.","The focus on measuring means anything that can't be measured is ignored. It's easy to measure someone's ability to code on a whiteboard. As a result, the coders are much better than nearly everywhere I've worked, but that's it. Social skills and personality can't be measured. As a result there is no one here you would ever be friends. The internal surveys bear this point that people don't have friends at work. Similarly for managers, they are selected strictly for their technical ability. Again, they have zero compassion. In my time being here, I've never once felt like anyone cared if I was here or not. Not once has anything positive ever been said. It's really astounding.

Recruiting does an amazing job at making candidates feel wanted. That feeling disappears the moment you sign. After that, you have no manager or anyone who will care. You'll go into bootcamp where you'll have a ""mentor"". His role is to continue to do his job while counting the number of lines in your diffs to make sure you can make progress with no assistance.

After bootcamp, you'll have a manager who operates in the same mode. They are interested in the technology and not the people. To them, you are a resource to be maximized. They will tell you everything you need to do to improve, but never once say ""good job"". In boot camp, I kept meeting these amazing, visionary dynamic managers. I know realize they were the exception. Those people made me love Facebook during bootcamp, but that feeling wore off quickly once I interacted with the average line level manager.

Plus, beware of the reviews here. Recruiting will tell you point blank that they curate these reviews. The reason FB has the highest rating is because someone internally has a goal to achieve certain star ratings on this site.",Software Engineer,Current Employee,"Menlo Park, CA","Feb 12, 2014"

2959,5,Really the best engineering experience I have hoped for,"During the 5+ years I've worked here as an engineer, I've had really incredible and satisfying experiences.  I've learned so much more than I did at my past company in a similar amount of time, have almost never been disappointed with the caliber of a co-worker (and I've worked somewhat closely with around 50 other engineers) and have gotten to contribute the product as a clip I wouldn't have believed possible.  As an engineer I felt like I had a lot of control and influence over my work and the products I worked on and got to create some of the most impactful and satisfying products and features of my career, past and probably future.  If you're really great at what you do or have really great product ideas, very little will interfere with you showing that quickly.  New engineers are highly valued in the culture.

Salary/bonus compensation has been really strong in addition to the stock compensation.","I've felt like I've been able to maintain a pretty good work life/balance (especially after the first year), but I feel like I had to work hard to make that happen.  Being around many people who feel compelled to put most of their waking weekday hours into coding can be intimidating, even when you feel confident in the job you're doing and even when pressure to put in a ton of hours is rarely explicit.  Engineers can definitely work reasonable hours, especially older ones with families, but you have to bring your own self-confidence to trust that you're kicking butt even if you're not putting in a ton of hours (especially during the summers when interns ratchet up the intensity around the office)

Things are done very fast, which also means things can be hectic and sometimes chaotic (though this feels less and less true as the years go by), but I'd expect some culture shock for anyone coming from software companies where stability and consensus are top-priorities.

- Openness. Do you have an issue with a colleague or something facebook is doing? No problem. Take care of it. Facebook encourages its employees to be open and give feedback for things they think should be improved.

- Do you want to see your impact on 1 billion users? Come to facebook. Although I'm not in engineering, I work with a lot of software engineers, including interns, who constantly talk about the things they work on and how they love showing these off to their friends and family.","- Being 7 months new, I am still in the process of thinking of areas of improvement.",Recruiter,Current Employee,"Menlo Park, CA","Nov 13, 2012"

The company cares about its employees' quality of life; we have excellent food, shuttles to/from San Francisco, a culture that eschews meetings, great ergonomics, onsite medical care, and a gym.  New engineers go through ""bootcamp,"" which exposes you to all aspects of the codebase in a friendly environment where you're allowed to ask n00bish questions and bond with other new engineers.","It's difficult to come up with meaningful downsides to working here.

2963,5,Continuous Improvement,"I've been at Facebook for more than six years.  The culture is very introspective and dedicated to self-improvement; if it were the same company it had been in 2009, I wouldn't still be there.  Everytime I think I might leave, a new awesome project comes up that keeps me around.  Seeing Mark Zuckerberg mature into the great leader he is has been magical, and I have a lot of trust in Sheryl and Mark and Mike Schroepfer to make good decisions.  
In many ways, engineers are more productive now than they were in 2009, despite the fact that we work at a big company now.  We have more tools, resources, and knowledgeable people at our disposal, which compensates to some degree for the increased bureaucracy you see in some parts of the company.  We also launch to hundreds-of-millions-to-billions of users, depending on the product, making our contributions very high-value.  Product launches continue to be driven by bottom-up ideas as much as top-down directives.  That doesn't mean that you personally are going to have an idea which shakes the world, but it does mean that you have a better shot than other companies.
Especially if you're an infrastructure engineer, the culture is very bottom-up.  You still have great latitude to come up with execute your own ideas.  The flipside of this coin is that if you're not good at deciding what to work on, you'll need to learn that skill within a year or so; management isn't going to spoonfeed you tasks to the extent they do at other large companies.
When joining Facebook as an engineer, you will still have many many choices of which team to join, and you'll make that decision after a few weeks of ""bootcamp"" which means you'll have an informed choice.  It also means that the quality of engineers is high throughout the company because every person comes through the same interviewing process.
One of my favorite aspects of Facebook culture is focusing on impact rather than hard work. Another is a recognition that you can advance your career without going into management, and that there are many different kinds of talent.  There are several different ""archetypes"" of senior individual contributors that are recognized and encouraged to flourish.","Facebook has become more careful in certain core areas like Newsfeed, Timeline, Ads, and Platform.  There are many stakeholders on these products and thus you've got to get a lot more things buttoned up before you can launch a product change in these core areas.  We still do experiments but not quite as freely as before.  Just understand that the more impact your product has, the tougher it will be to make changes, and place yourself in the company according to your preferences.",Software Engineer,Current Employee,"Menlo Park, CA","Feb 15, 2016"
2964,5,Don't believe all of the negative press,"Having worked at Facebook for a number of years, and having experienced many other companies prior, I am still incredibly proud to work at such a company that values its employees, is so open and transparent, and that has a mission I truly believe in. Speaking with a number of employees who left Facebook only to return once again, while no company is perfect, there is a lot that Facebook has to offer - not just in terms of benefits, but with the impact that our apps and services have on this world - for people and businesses alike. 

Our open culture is pretty amazing to understand the vision of our company and where we're heading. Leadership has been consistently transparent in ways that many other companies are not - even other tech companies - with weekly Q&As, open posts, and quarterly all hands. And they address tough issues or topics head on. 

There are a lot of career opportunities within the company - as we often refer to the ""jungle gym"" that you can take your career internally. There are incredibly passionate people who work at Facebook, and I never cease to be amazed by the level of intelligence and care demonstrated by my coworkers around the world to help our company deliver on our mission.","Particularly as of late, Facebook has been subject to a lot of negative press. While some of it may be deserved, a lot of it feels sensationalist. So employees have to develop a thick skin and resilience to a lot of this scrutiny and ensure that we are focused on the long-term, not just the short-term.

2990,1,Horrible terrible company with worst culture,"Free food, good salary, hype","At Facebook I got to know what ""gaslighting"" really means. Gaslighting is exactly what is the culture that is imposed top-down by management. It starts at the bootcamp. There, you'll be properly brainwashed how cute and cuddly Facebook is, how unfairly it is being treated by everybody, how great and kind the Czar and his ruling gang is, and how grateful and privileged you (a despicable useless worm) should feel to be here! Right there, in the bootcamp, they will start the abusive treatment by telling you ""why on Earth did we hire you? You do not submit any code during last 24 hours!"" This abuse and fostering of your impostor syndrome will keep going on. Typical Facebook-style management is when you are being repeatedly told ""I have no idea how did you got here, and if how come you were not fired yesterday - but OK, we'll give you one more chance"".  This is part of this culture! 
There is a STACK RANKING! It's in tooling, in manager training materials! The fact that Facebook officially denies doing it is a yet-another confirmation that this company doesn't shy away from crime. Stack ranking means that all colleagues see each other as a competition. When I started my job at Facebook, my closest colleague didn't want to talk to me, because he knew that the better I succeed, the worse is for him. This is very profound and affects everybody: it's a hostile work environment. 
Performance reviews is a complete sham. There is one ""axis"" which is related to your actual performance. The other 3 (three!) axes (direction, etc.) is a complete baloney, and can be used to justify ANY rating for anyone. All managers are deeply ignorant schmoozers. 

Cult means there are plenty of taboo topics for which you'll be fired. There are, for example, internal ""non-managers"" groups, which are patrolled for any signs of dissent. If a person posts anything out of line there, this gets straight to his manager and HR. 
HR is the worst people I've met. They enforce the authoritarian rule ruthlessly and with cynicism. 

Working at Facebook has permanently damaged my faith in humanity. I realized that people can still do horrible crimes, given enough brainwashing.

Not all my peers are brilliant about all things (which is good, as I'm certainly not) but every one of them is smarter than I am about at least one thing, and it takes very little time to find out what.

- The perks are great. I have gotten broken glasses fixed by the dry cleaner for only a low tax rate. The food is shockingly good for the scale of the cafes, and I'm impressed every day by the whole MPK service operation.

- Workplace is much better than emails as a site for debate/discussion about what to do.

Part of this is that the starting comp isn't  very good. The vesting stock is, but the cash is fairly mediocre (less than previous jobs I've had at far less profitable companies), and vesting accelerates over time. This nets to you being paid much more than before, year over year.

Managers main job is to write performance reviews, and this often leads to micro management that can be extremely frustrating to senior engineers. 

There's lot of work duplication, most managers (even directors) ignore it as performance reviews is all about impact. Most engineers know that everyone wants to write code and make impact, so ignore the code duplication.

Some teams are hiring just for the head count, not much impactful work. This becomes a problem for senior engineers as they have to invent work or get out. Before joining a team check out their roadmap for at least a year.

This is a good place if you want make money at the cost of WLB. Not a  place to be innovative, which inherently carries risk and takes time. It's a risk because if there's no impact you'll be fired.

* The decaf coffee actually tastes good - seriously, I miss Facebook coffee so much","* Your job satisfaction (and your salary) can change greatly depending on where you are in the company. My technical title was substituted with a non-technical ""specialist"" equivalent that paid less, resulting in a 20% bump in my salary when left, despite downgrading from a ""lead"" level position at Facebook to a ""senior"" level position at my current job.
* Management is often promoted based on seniority rather than competence.
* ""Most fast"" mentality leads to duplicated work, lack of documentation, and general confusion. Senior ICs are expected to spend much of their time project managing to make up for the failure in organization. I often found during requirements gathering for a project that part or all of it had already been done elsewhere and everyone had simply forgotten about it.
* The culture of open communication makes it seem like employee feedback is valued and encouraged, but actions are rarely taken on that feedback.

Rampant hostile political atmosphere
Team leadership and IC's will undermine and berate service team members to push their agendas forward.  This is often overlooked by leaderhip and results in burnout and lack of empathy from everyone.  This in turn produces subpar results and half-baked solutions.  No one wins.

Sloppy processes
It's a benefit of a doubt to even say there are processes.  Most of the internal processes are poorly documented and no one has or wants to give time to onboard new hires (see comment below on the culture driving self-absorbed motives).  Getting anything done is 60% figuring out the best way forward, 20% fighting off the political backlash from making said decision and not the one the loudest stakeholder in the room wanted, and 20% is actually spent doing the work.  So much waste.  No concept of agile or the fundamentals of development practices in parts of Community Operations.

No humanity in the human facing part of the org
Working in Community Operations often felt like working in a call center.  People often don't care about their work and they don't care to look beyond the ""what's in it for me"" philosophy running the show to see the people that the organization is supposed to help.  We're talking about posts around some of the worst stuff out there- and the lack of empathy around it is nauseating and explains alot of the trouble Facebook has been getting into.

Custom everything means sloppy everything
So many of the internal tools are custom- even the ones that don't need to be!  Often the tools are under supported (or supported by a staff that isn't willing to take feedback) so you end up with subpar tools supporting a massive company that is in desperate need of some tools that are built with intent and full functionality behind them.

Culture breeds self-absorbed motives within people
Facebook's culture is oriented around ""impact""- what impact did YOU have this performance evaluation period.  It's not enough to say that you helped remove content that was harmful to minors (as an example unrelated to my direct experience).  The impact needs to tie back to numbers- how many lines of code, how much money was saved, how many productive hours were saved-- not one of the questions asked is about how it helps the PEOPLE that use Facebook.  It is all inward focused on the individual contributor- and as such the individual contributors act accordingly.  There is not team oriented thought or conduct in my experience across Community Ops.  There is only ""What's in it for me?"" 

HRBP are often ill informed on processes and policies and rotate like the second hand on a clock
You never know what you're going to get with the HRBP group- some are warm and empathetic others are very clearly only there to protect the company (meaning they'll pigeon hole you into a defensive position).  I didn't have a great experience with them and even in my exit process they got details wrong- like really important details.  Kind of disappointing. 

Middle management is hijacking the company for personal gain and Upper Management hasn't caught on yet
When I hear Mark talk- I see someone who really does believe in the mission behind the company- to make the world a more connected place.  But I'm not sure that he or his team see the snakes in the grass that are not aligned to that mission and only looking for ways to achieve their personal gain.

3054,5,"Visionary leadership, industry experts will be your peers, the ability to impact billions, and incredible benefits","I am not hyperbolizing when I say that working at Facebook is the best job I could possibly imagine.

You get to work with a visionary leadership team that is incredibly accessible and wants to hear from you. Mark's Townhall meetings grew out of the weekly Q&A that he runs internally. If you want to ask Mark Zuckerburg or Sheryl Sandberg a question you can do it. If you want to give feedback or see changes in nearly any aspect of Facebook you will be empowered to do it.

Your team will likely be comprised of industry experts in your particular area of work. From kernel hackers, PhD's in computer learning, hardware engineers building drones and our own servers, to network engineers that are helping write drafts and RFC's that define the underlying protocol architecture of the Internet - you will find everything under the sun and these people will make you so much better at what you do.

If you aren't enjoying what you're doing in your current role you can go on a Hack-a-month with another team. This lets you expand your skills working on a different set of challenges and stay on your new team when you finish, if you like the work, or head back to your old team to work on something else. The best part is that management encourages these types of moves!

The management teams empower you to work on the things you want to, and gives you the ability to impact billions of people. You work on one of the biggest platforms on the planet and you will see the results of the work you put in everyday in making it better.

Also, the benefits are pretty amazing.","Any complaints seem like extreme first world gripes given all that the company does to keep the employees happy and progressing in their positions and careers, but I do have a few.

The company will absolutely (and gladly) take as much time as you put in. They don't overly pressure you to work insane hours, but you will be surrounded by overachievers who put that pressure on themselves and create the perception that large swaths of the company are, ""always working."" This can be a blessing or curse and it is up to each individual employee to figure out the dreaded work / life balance equation for themselves.

The other issue, is that Facebook prides itself on not competing on salary, RSU's, etc. against offers from other companies. While that may seem ok in practice, it results in a revolving door (which is a bit of a Silicon Valley issue in and of itself) between other big tech companies and Facebook.

3070,5,I found my people,"I really feel as though I've found my people.

I've had this dissonance in past roles: ever since academia years ago, I've been out of the ""research"" phase and into the ""engineer at a X company"" stage, where ""X"" is occasionally a software product but more often a service or commercial product.  The culture was not one of making the right things, but making the profitable thing now.  Driven by sales people, there was a lot of grandstanding, peacocking, both in the culture and in the message.

Facebook has my people, my culture.  We do things in the way that scales and makes engineering sense.  Sure, perfect is the enemy of good enough, but if a temporary shortcut remediates a problem or a need, it's quickly iterated to improve, all the while immersed in a tech culture: Pusheen, Archer, Dr Who, Starwars, memes, the micro-actions that continually reinforce a culture-fit or a culture-miss.

I'm in the culture fit.  Sure, I get a very competitive salary, plus my tech chops improve (when C++ gurus review your work, your C++ quality improves), and the food, and the perks, but above all, this is the place I feel I most fit.

I'm in my mid-40s.  I ""get schooled"" my mid-20s.  ...and it's awesome.","Pace is a killer.  The work is complex, as are the discussions about it, I have little fuel in my head to code after work.  Big personal desire to keep up to the more efficient engineers.  I don't want to pass-a-fault, but want to move-fast, get all the things done.  It's exhausting!",Production Engineer,Current Employee,"Menlo Park, CA","Apr 16, 2017"
3071,5,"Warm supportive culture, embraces autonomy and diversity, full of elite talent","I've been at Facebook for 6 months. I've never been one for loyalty to my job or my company, but at least in Social VR, my team are some of the most genuinely supportive and caring people I've ever met in my life and I really feel like they accept me and will be there for me both when I need things at work and when I'm having personal difficulties. I'm given full autonomy to pursue the things that I think are most important. My team is incredibly diverse (including transgender, black, Asian, Pacific Islander, Latino, and an unusually high percentage of women) which shows both an extraordinary commitment to diversity and gives me faith that the product will be built to serve diverse customers. And the backgrounds of the people on my team are shockingly elite, with many projects on their resumes that are immediately familiar to and admired by me. I'm also proud that Facebook has so many people at the very top who are strongly committed to VR - like Zuckerberg's ambitious announcement at OC4 that his goal is to have a billion people in VR.","Facebook is hugely committed to transparency and authentic identity. So if you value separating your personal life and work life, don't want to share your personal feelings with coworkers or hear about theirs (or offer emotional support), or don't like to share with other people in the broader company what you're working on, it may be a bad fit for you. Likewise, if you prefer to be directed by leadership rather than establishing your own direction autonomously, Facebook might be a bad fit for you. Finally, Facebook's primary Menlo Park campus is located in the middle of nowhere with very little else around - you eat and get all your services on campus, with the nearest downtown a 15 min drive away. If you prefer to be in an urban center, you should either consider a different location, or a different company.",Software Engineer,Current Employee,"Menlo Park, CA","Dec 13, 2017"

Honestly, just that I feel conflicted about the good social media can play in people's lives.

3073,5,Great company to work at - do not believe to different news,"I work in company for 6 months, but I like how company works and operates. One of policies is an openness  - this includes famous weekly Q&As. Senior management tries to explain the background behind decisions, so you know why one or another thing had to be done. 

In general everything focuses on making product which would be better for customers. There were a number of mistakes makes with privacy perspective, but there is a trend to improve this. This is very good approach - instead of hiding mistakes, company focuses on fixing them. After getting an offer I was not sure to join the company because of its reputation, but being inside I figured out most of this is an exaggerations to make a hype in news.

Work style is very flexible - you want to deliver new things, to make an impact, but from another perspective, it is not demanding and it is far from sweat factory in some other companies. It left time to learn something, you can attend many meeting remotely. Work life balance is very good - it is difficult to improve it without affecting the work (someone should do the work, right?). 

There are a lot of young people around (ex-students, but usually with great knowledge), but also there are still a number of experienced people - so aging doesn't seems to be a problem at FB.","Work style is open space. Many new buildings are awesome, while a number of old buildings are depressing - dimmed lighting, gray ceilings. Some buildings have a quiet policy, but for others it is not so good.  I'd recommend remodel old buildings (hack, paint ceiling to a white, so it will reflect the light, install better lighting, work with designers!),  split large rooms into smaller, team-sized rooms, add more VC rooms so people could easier get on conference call without disturbing others.

Another minus is hyper-concentrated campus in Menlo Park. It is difficult to find a good, reasonable-priced rent in that area. It works well for young people, but for families with kids there are a lot of other factors to be taken into account, so Menlo Park area just doesn't work.",Senior Software Engineer,Current Employee,"Menlo Park, CA","Sep 12, 2019"
3074,5,Excellent Place to Work,"The opportunity that Facebook offers for autonomy and career growth is incredible; coming in as a new grad PE I have the opportunity to grow based on merit and performance, not time in the role. 

Flexibility in when I work, how I prioritize my projects, and the scope of my work is invigorating and makes me excited to come to work each day. The company is mission-driven to a great extent, and I have been impressed with the way we have owned up to prior mistakes and fixed them head on. 

The Production Engineering role is well respected within the company, and the importance of reliability and scaling increases as our services reach more of the world. As a PE you will gain the knowledge necessary to build and operate real hyperscale systems capable of providing services to billions of people.

My team is comprised of some of the smartest, experienced engineers I have ever met - some of which have been building Linux services since 0.01. Even though sometimes working at Facebook feels like drinking from the proverbial fire hose, I am grateful I have the opportunity to learn from some of the top people in their field. For example, in bootcamp I took a command-line efficiency class from Jim Meyering, one of the maintainers of coreutils and also a Facebook employee.

Many other people have commented on this, but the perks and compensation are still top-notch. The company helps take care of your life so you can focus on work while you're working.","Facebook hires the kind of people that expect a lot from themselves. Despite some reports, you do not need to work long hours in order to succeed at Facebook. Bootcamp gives you the chance to find a team that matches you well, and new hires should come in intending to join a team where they can both find balance and grow in their career.

The company is growing and there is some sentiment around slowing down, but most engineering teams are still bottom-up driven and innovating in their space. The things we are doing around privacy and AR/VR are on the bleeding edge and we are strong leaders in these areas.

On the other hand, ironically, there is also sentiment around moving too fast as a company. Since we are people- and product-focused (as opposed to engineering-focused, like at Google), our primary goal is to impact the lives of people for good. Sometimes this means we opt for rapid prototyping over beautifully designed code. However, we are doing much better at recognizing better engineering work such as cleaning up code and improving monitoring, especially in the PE role.",Production Engineer,Current Employee,"Menlo Park, CA","Jan 10, 2020"

3086,3,Good and the Bad. It really depends on your team,"Facebook has a lot of Pro's but it really depends on the team you land on and the internal politics that surround that particular unit. That is no different than any other company but it can be night and day here.

Generally here are the Pros
- People: Majority of the other Facebookers are of high quality and surrounding yourself with other smart people can only up your own game.

- Benefits: Positive package here overall. They take care of your health, make some life task much easier and try to make life more comfortable.

- Technology: Innovative mindset is a big plus but recent years have been more mirror moves with competition to gain an advantage. Good move but for those that want to break the glass into new frontiers, you got to pick the right team.

Impact: The opportunity is there for you to embrace.","Generally here are the Cons:
- People / Culture: There is a small minority of leftist that can be loud and push activist agenda's that are in your face. While my own goals can align (leftist) I don't like their approach. This is just society creeping into the corporate world and is seen across Tech in general. It can be toxic and extremely disrespectful. You might find more of this at Facebook due to the nature of the product. Imagine the rest... Pick your team wisely.

- Weak Leadership: Lot of new leaders... Experienced leaders may not have much experience with trouble shooting negative situations and come in with a bias. Another point here is the number of Re-Orgs. You might experience multiple changes within a quarter / half and this can drag on for years.  

- Negative news cycle ... it can be draining but it should be a wake up call to further innovate for a product for today. However... this news cycle is long... I mean looooooong and can be intense at times.",Product Marketing,Former Employee,"Menlo Park, CA","Jan 30, 2020"

It is staffed by some of the smartest people in the world who are industry leaders in whatever it is they do whether it is software engineering, design, public policy, even more traditional functions like HR and Finance!

It is extremely difficult to get hired at the company given the companies intense focus on culture and values (which is not always accurate).  It is also an intense environment, and not for people who are looking to coast.  This can be difficult for people with a lot of obligations outside of work.

Projects are run by PMs who really know what they are doing with a strong skill set in strategy, engineering, data driven decision making and user experience. 
Strategic direction - Money truly is a means by which we can achieve the mission to connect the world. There are tons of bold bets and we seem to have a good balance of reacting to the marketplace and maintaining focus on executing with blinders when necessary.
Opportunity - There is so much work for really anyone to come in and make. With such rapid growth, there are bound to be mega bugs or missed opportunities ripe for fresh eyes to come in and recognize immediately.
Culture - The company values are genuine and you really do get the feel that you are working on something bigger than yourself. Getting to hear from and ask questions of Mark each week really helps makes sure everyone is in the loop and feels heard if they disagree. You are never ""out of line"" for thinking big picture or questioning strategic direction and it is in fact encouraged. There's also a ton of young people so it is great to meet friends, especially if you live in SF.","Time - There are amazing perks like really quality free food all the time, a gym on campus with a basketball court and large playing field, shuttles to SF and surrounding areas but I often find my coworkers and I spend less time on that fun stuff that you might expect. There's just so much work opportunity because you are expected to be driving on projects rather than just doing what you are told so you could theoretically work all the time and its up to you to stop that.
Company maturity - Like all fast growing companies, there is a natural curiosity around ""how much better would things be for me if I had joined earlier?"" because there would have been ever more responsibility and financial potential.

I think management is pretty good here as well, and you definitely work with really great engineers.  The pay is great, the benefits are awesome, you are largely treated well, but this is a company you can definitely bite into too hard and overwork yourself.  The place is still a lot more open internally than other corporate machines, less so since going public.  Also, you get the sense that Mark has a vision, and really wants to execute on that.

3118,5,Perks Beyond Comprehension and an Opportunity to Change the World,"If the reviews here sound like employees are really drinking the Kool-Aid...it's because many of them are.  The people at this company genuinely believe they're changing the world by connecting it, and that mission and set of values permeate everything they do.  

-Unbelievable benefits and compensation.  Seriously, some of their benefits are mind-blowing.  Gym benefits, free (really good) food everywhere, amazing healthcare and family planning and daycare benefits (including a ""baby bonus""), access to incredible company events and speakers, generous vacation time that they're constantly encouraging you to actually use, the latest phones and computers for work use, on-site doctor and dentist that are actually good...the list goes on and on.  
- Strong company culture and values.  I've never been at a company that lives and breathes a mission so completely.  Am constantly in meetings where coworkers are asking, ""Is this the right decision for the people who use Facebook?"".  Even the way they treat their contingent workers (who receive better benefits than most of the tech sector's contingent employees do) makes this evident; there are internal communication groups where full-time employees are constantly asking what more we could be doing for contingent workers to show our appreciation for their work. Both internally and externally, the ""#shiplove"" mantra is strong here.
-Work/life balance.  You'll see some mixed reviews on this point, but I've been here a year (non-engineering role) and I've never had the level of work/life balance I've had here.  I work a very consistent 9-5, and it's rare when I have to fire up my laptop at home at night or over the weekends.
-Facilities.  It's Facebook!  The campus is gorgeous, and they allow visitors.  Hosting out-of-town friends and family for lunch or dinner is a great perk.
-Efficient and fast.  Fewer politics than many other companies of this size.  A lot of the day-to-day communication and work gets done on the Facebook platform, which is hugely efficient and easy to use system.
-The future!  These guys have their hands in a lot of cookie jars, and are working on some really amazing stuff.  Whether you're working on things like bringing internet access to the third world, virtual reality products, artificial intelligence that will serve peoples' needs, or all of the innovative things that go on inside the regular ol' Facebook app that serves over a billion people a day, chances are you're working on something really cool.
-Women's leadership.  I've also never been at a company that really understands women's needs as much as Facebook does (I think we owe this to the leadership of Sheryl Sandberg, Lori Goler and Maxine Williams).  They encourage an ongoing dialogue about women's issues in the workplace, have mothers' rooms all around campus, encourage us all to take a ""Managing Bias"" course (which is really eye-opening, on many levels) and even host a yearly Women's Leadership Day, which is truly empowering.  They bring in amazing speakers for this event and out of everything I've experienced in my first year here, this was probably the event that stayed with me the most.","-Entitlement.  After you've worked here for a while, it's easy to get entitled.  I'd say 95% of employees keep their feet on the ground and appreciative and gracious about the benefits they receive, but the entitlement plus the company's culture of open f",Anonymous Employee,Current Employee,"Menlo Park, CA","Oct 5, 2015"
3119,5,I found my people,"I really feel as though I've found my people.

I've had this dissonance in past roles: ever since academia years ago, I've been out of the ""research"" phase and into the ""engineer at a X company"" stage, where ""X"" is occasionally a software product but more often a service or commercial product.  The culture was not one of making the right things, but making the profitable thing now.  Driven by sales people, there was a lot of grandstanding, peacocking, both in the culture and in the message.

Facebook has my people, my culture.  We do things in the way that scales and makes engineering sense.  Sure, perfect is the enemy of good enough, but if a temporary shortcut remediates a problem or a need, it's quickly iterated to improve, all the while immersed in a tech culture: Pusheen, Archer, Dr Who, Starwars, memes, the micro-actions that continually reinforce a culture-fit or a culture-miss.

I'm in the culture fit.  Sure, I get a very competitive salary, plus my tech chops improve (when C++ gurus review your work, your C++ quality improves), and the food, and the perks, but above all, this is the place I feel I most fit.

I'm in my mid-40s.  I ""get schooled"" my mid-20s.  ...and it's awesome.","Pace is a killer.  The work is complex, as are the discussions about it, I have little fuel in my head to code after work.  Big personal desire to keep up to the more efficient engineers.  I don't want to pass-a-fault, but want to move-fast, get all the things done.  It's exhausting!",Production Engineer,Current Employee,"Menlo Park, CA","Apr 16, 2017"
3120,5,"Warm supportive culture, embraces autonomy and diversity, full of elite talent","I've been at Facebook for 6 months. I've never been one for loyalty to my job or my company, but at least in Social VR, my team are some of the most genuinely supportive and caring people I've ever met in my life and I really feel like they accept me and will be there for me both when I need things at work and when I'm having personal difficulties. I'm given full autonomy to pursue the things that I think are most important. My team is incredibly diverse (including transgender, black, Asian, Pacific Islander, Latino, and an unusually high percentage of women) which shows both an extraordinary commitment to diversity and gives me faith that the product will be built to serve diverse customers. And the backgrounds of the people on my team are shockingly elite, with many projects on their resumes that are immediately familiar to and admired by me. I'm also proud that Facebook has so many people at the very top who are strongly committed to VR - like Zuckerberg's ambitious announcement at OC4 that his goal is to have a billion people in VR.","Facebook is hugely committed to transparency and authentic identity. So if you value separating your personal life and work life, don't want to share your personal feelings with coworkers or hear about theirs (or offer emotional support), or don't like to share with other people in the broader company what you're working on, it may be a bad fit for you. Likewise, if you prefer to be directed by leadership rather than establishing your own direction autonomously, Facebook might be a bad fit for you. Finally, Facebook's primary Menlo Park campus is located in the middle of nowhere with very little else around - you eat and get all your services on campus, with the nearest downtown a 15 min drive away. If you prefer to be in an urban center, you should either consider a different location, or a different company.",Software Engineer,Current Employee,"Menlo Park, CA","Dec 13, 2017"

Willing to make changes to the system for the benefit of users despite costing the company money.,"I had to think really hard to find any, which is a great thing. Honestly, just that I feel conflicted about the good social media can play in people's lives. But the company is making strides towards wellbeing, like notifying users of time spent in-app and showing them a message when they're ""up to date"" with today's content so they don't mindlessly scroll.",Software Engineer,Current Employee,"San Francisco, CA","Sep 2, 2018"
3122,5,Great company to work at - do not believe to different news,"I work in company for 6 months, but I like how company works and operates. One of policies is an openness  - this includes famous weekly Q&As. Senior management tries to explain the background behind decisions, so you know why one or another thing had to be done. 

In general everything focuses on making product which would be better for customers. There were a number of mistakes makes with privacy perspective, but there is a trend to improve this. This is very good approach - instead of hiding mistakes, company focuses on fixing them. After getting an offer I was not sure to join the company because of its reputation, but being inside I figured out most of this is an exaggerations to make a hype in news.

Work style is very flexible - you want to deliver new things, to make an impact, but from another perspective, it is not demanding and it is far from sweat factory in some other companies. It left time to learn something, you can attend many meeting remotely. Work life balance is very good - it is difficult to improve it without affecting the work (someone should do the work, right?). 

There are a lot of young people around (ex-students, but usually with great knowledge), but also there are still a number of experienced people - so aging doesn't seems to be a problem at FB.","Work style is open space. Many new buildings are awesome, while a number of old buildings are depressing - dimmed lighting, gray ceilings. Some buildings have a quiet policy, but for others it is not so good.  I'd recommend remodel old buildings (hack, paint ceiling to a white, so it will reflect the light, install better lighting, work with designers!),  split large rooms into smaller, team-sized rooms, add more VC rooms so people could easier get on conference call without disturbing others.

Another minus is hyper-concentrated campus in Menlo Park. It is difficult to find a good, reasonable-priced rent in that area. It works well for young people, but for families with kids there are a lot of other factors to be taken into account, so Menlo Park area just doesn't work.",Senior Software Engineer,Current Employee,"Menlo Park, CA","Sep 12, 2019"
3123,5,Excellent Place to Work,"The opportunity that Facebook offers for autonomy and career growth is incredible; coming in as a new grad PE I have the opportunity to grow based on merit and performance, not time in the role. 

Flexibility in when I work, how I prioritize my projects, and the scope of my work is invigorating and makes me excited to come to work each day. The company is mission-driven to a great extent, and I have been impressed with the way we have owned up to prior mistakes and fixed them head on. 

The Production Engineering role is well respected within the company, and the importance of reliability and scaling increases as our services reach more of the world. As a PE you will gain the knowledge necessary to build and operate real hyperscale systems capable of providing services to billions of people.

My team is comprised of some of the smartest, experienced engineers I have ever met - some of which have been building Linux services since 0.01. Even though sometimes working at Facebook feels like drinking from the proverbial fire hose, I am grateful I have the opportunity to learn from some of the top people in their field. For example, in bootcamp I took a command-line efficiency class from Jim Meyering, one of the maintainers of coreutils and also a Facebook employee.

Many other people have commented on this, but the perks and compensation are still top-notch. The company helps take care of your life so you can focus on work while you're working.","Facebook hires the kind of people that expect a lot from themselves. Despite some reports, you do not need to work long hours in order to succeed at Facebook. Bootcamp gives you the chance to find a team that matches you well, and new hires should come in intending to join a team where they can both find balance and grow in their career.

The company is growing and there is some sentiment around slowing down, but most engineering teams are still bottom-up driven and innovating in their space. The things we are doing around privacy and AR/VR are on the bleeding edge and we are strong leaders in these areas.

On the other hand, ironically, there is also sentiment around moving too fast as a company. Since we are people- and product-focused (as opposed to engineering-focused, like at Google), our primary goal is to impact the lives of people for good. Sometimes this means we opt for rapid prototyping over beautifully designed code. However, we are doing much better at recognizing better engineering work such as cleaning up code and improving monitoring, especially in the PE role.",Production Engineer,Current Employee,"Menlo Park, CA","Jan 10, 2020"

I was lied to multiple time by management. I was told my rating depended on the reviews from my peers, but then when the perf came, I realized it is 100% up to the manager regardless of what your peers say. My manager told me constantly I was doing great, then perf came and because I questioned the principles, I had a bad rating. The 360 was useless, management can use if they want to promote you, but if you are not in great terms with your manager, the 360 will be ignored.

It is staffed by some of the smartest people in the world who are industry leaders in whatever it is they do whether it is software engineering, design, public policy, even more traditional functions like HR and Finance!  Facebook redefines what it means to be a corporation with its unique move fast and break things culture, its culture of discipline, and its innovative and iterative approach.

It is extremely difficult to get hired at the company given the companies intense focus on culture and values (which is not always accurate).  It is also an intense environment, and not for people who are looking to coast.  This can be difficult for people with a lot of obligations outside of work.

Projects are run by PMs who really know what they are doing with a strong skill set in strategy, engineering, data driven decision making and user experience. 
Strategic direction - Money truly is a means by which we can achieve the mission to connect the world. There are tons of bold bets and we seem to have a good balance of reacting to the marketplace and maintaining focus on executing with blinders when necessary.
Opportunity - There is so much work for really anyone to come in and make. With such rapid growth, there are bound to be mega bugs or missed opportunities ripe for fresh eyes to come in and recognize immediately.
Culture - The company values are genuine and you really do get the feel that you are working on something bigger than yourself. Getting to hear from and ask questions of Mark each week really helps makes sure everyone is in the loop and feels heard if they disagree. You are never ""out of line"" for thinking big picture or questioning strategic direction and it is in fact encouraged. There's also a ton of young people so it is great to meet friends, especially if you live in SF.","Time - There are amazing perks like really quality free food all the time, a gym on campus with a basketball court and large playing field, shuttles to SF and surrounding areas but I often find my coworkers and I spend less time on that fun stuff that you might expect. There's just so much work opportunity because you are expected to be driving on projects rather than just doing what you are told so you could theoretically work all the time and its up to you to stop that.
Company maturity - Like all fast growing companies, there is a natural curiosity around ""how much better would things be for me if I had joined earlier?"" because there would have been ever more responsibility and financial potential. Both of those things are still really high but it does raise the natural question of it would make sense to gain the skill sets to understand what makes Facebook work and then consider working somewhere smaller with more financial upside.",Internet Marketing Analyst,Current Employee,"Menlo Park, CA","Jul 28, 2013"

Large divide in pay between people on the same teams and little transparency into the payment and growth processes.  

Additionally, most employees share a highly liberal political stance, which drives the culture in a mostly positive way, but it also requires that everyone agrees with the mindset.  Those that have differing values can expect to feel ostracized.  

Finally, the treatment of vendors and contractors (including facilities staff, janitors, kitchen staff, security guards, and receptionists, among others) by employees can be staggeringly disappointing, embarrassing, and offensive. There is so much of a sense of entitlement upon employees that many seem to view others as second-class citizens.",Online Operations Associate,Current Employee,"Menlo Park, CA","Aug 2, 2013"
3186,5,Extremely open and fast moving company.,"You ship code within your first two weeks. Hundreds of millions of people around the world care about what you do. Pay and benefits are great, particularly RSU offerings. You're expected to move up (and get raises, bonuses, more RSUs) quickly. You can do pretty much whatever you want and work on whatever you want. There aren't a lot of rules, other than security/privacy practices. Even on mobile apps, your code ships fast. 

Facebook's onboarding process is the best I've ever seen, and I've worked at a lot of other major companies. You're hired as an engineer, not as someone to fill a specific job. Then you spend your first six weeks getting to know how all of the company works, filling in small holes on code bases that you aren't familiar with (web, Android, iOS, data analysis stuff), and learning what problems in the company you most want to work on, before you pick your team. Every large software company should be doing this.","They do claim ownership of code you write outside of work, unless you run it by legal first.",Software Engineer IV,Current Employee,"Menlo Park, CA","Mar 1, 2014"
3187,4,Pretty good place to work,"The campus is insane, great place to be, delicious food, positive environment overall. Young team overall, great benefits.","The company has grown a lot and with that came politics and an unusual (at least for me) level of competitiveness amongst colleagues. Constant re-orgs make it a little difficult to grow, as you end up changing managers all the time and you role changes as well.

3194,2,"Smart, boring people and no balance.","The people are smart, and the scaling challenges are great. Where else does your code impact a billion people? The compensation is amazing.

Senior management are generally amazing people, smart, visionary and compassionate.","The focus on measuring means anything that can't be measured is ignored. It's easy to measure someone's ability to code on a whiteboard. As a result, the coders are much better than nearly everywhere I've worked, but that's it. Social skills and personality can't be measured. As a result there is no one here you would ever be friends. The internal surveys bear this point that people don't have friends at work. Similarly for managers, they are selected strictly for their technical ability. Again, they have zero compassion. In my time being here, I've never once felt like anyone cared if I was here or not. Not once has anything positive ever been said. It's really astounding.

Recruiting does an amazing job at making candidates feel wanted. That feeling disappears the moment you sign. After that, you have no manager or anyone who will care. You'll go into bootcamp where you'll have a ""mentor"". His role is to continue to do his job while counting the number of lines in your diffs to make sure you can make progress with no assistance.

After bootcamp, you'll have a manager who operates in the same mode. They are interested in the technology and not the people. To them, you are a resource to be maximized. They will tell you everything you need to do to improve, but never once say ""good job"". In boot camp, I kept meeting these amazing, visionary dynamic managers. I know realize they were the exception. Those people made me love Facebook during bootcamp, but that feeling wore off quickly once I interacted with the average line level manager.

Plus, beware of the reviews here. Recruiting will tell you point blank that they curate these reviews. The reason FB has the highest rating is because someone internally has a goal to achieve certain star ratings on this site.",Software Engineer,Current Employee,"Menlo Park, CA","Feb 12, 2014"

3196,5,"Talent, commitment, autonomy, impact.","The most important reason to work at Facebook is the other people working at Facebook. Almost all of them are very, very good. Down to about the 20th percentile of engineer, you can pretty much take their word as gold: if they say they'll do X in time Y, they will, and often a better X in a little less time than Y. This is a kind of super-power: it reduces the overhead of coordinating complex projects significantly.

Facebook is also a mission-focused organization, in the same sense that the military, or a relief agency is. Most employees understand the goal of the company to be larger than just making its employees and shareholders materially successful.

You will enjoy a vertiginous amount of authority as a front-line employee at Facebook. For better and for worse, on your first day at Facebook, you're given the keys to the proverbial Ferrari; you can push code, fix bugs, implement features, and yes, crash the site as much as any other engineer. Many user-facing decisions end up getting made by individual engineers.

This also implies that your work will have impact. Almost everyone you meet in your daily life is a user of your software. If they are unhappy users, it is your fault and responsibility to make it better. If they are happy users, you can enjoy your share of the credit.

All the basics (salary, equity, career advancement, food, miscellaneous perks like shuttles from SF) are world-class as well.","A mission-oriented job is not for everybody. If you are looking for a paycheck, and a ton of time to pursue your model railroading hobby, Facebook is going to be a weird fit for you. This is not to say that people don't have hobbies, or that everybody works 70 hrs/wk; but if you are completely ""checked out"" from your job, this will not be a happy place for you, not matter how good you are at it.

3200,5,Amazing company to work at,"Great company with an amazing culture. You work hard, the pace is fast, expectations are high, and change is constant, but Facebook really looks after its employees and provides a diverse array of opportunities for self development, cross-functional training and career growth. The CEO meets with all employees once a week and answers anyone's questions.

Most people here are energetic and passionate about their work and seriously focused on making an impact. The work environment is physically (and culturally) very open: open spaces, no offices, casual dress, etc. Work/life balance is respected and encouraged and you have the flexibility to work in the way that best matches your individual style and needs. Face-to-face communication is highly valued but meetings are generally focused on not time-wasting activities. Anyone can suggest a new feature or improvement and be part of the team that makes it happen. There is a lot of opportunity for high performers to grow their careers. The compensation, benefits and perks are truly above par. 

One of the most important things for me is the open culture and the way Facebook encourages employees to find and be our authentic selves, and to listen to the voices of others who may be different from ourselves. The company works very hard to create a diverse and welcoming environment for all.","It may be hard to adjust in the first few months if you're used to working in a traditional company.

3336,3,Simultaneously the best and worst experience,"The positive impact that the company is having all over the world is outstanding even if the company doesn't share this externally. There are many professional development opportunities to allow you keep growing. The perks could be a pro like free food, laundry, salon, etc. but I personally found it to feel like the company wants to keep you there instead of going home and having social interactions with people outside of Facebook. But, if you don' t have a strong social support network, it's a great set up. My co-workers were by far the best part of the company!","The hiring process is very strange as they hire people without knowing what team they'll be on, allowing for an opportunity to be placed on a team that's not a great fit, and then being stuck in it and not being able to move around until at least a year in. HR seems most concerned about protecting the company rather than really listening to employees and their concerns. There is a lot of turnover lately...I had 4 managers in about a 9 month span, which leads to really confusing situations. They also keep bad managers in their positions, even if there have been multiple concerns raised about them from a whole team.

Fast promotion if you can work long hours. 

Fast paced environment, you'll get to learn new stuff all the time. Lot of smart engineers around.","With fast promotion comes fast firing. It's up or out policy up to a certain level. 

Not a good place for senior engineers joining. Too much stress in the team driven by performance reviews, which is the most aggressive that I've ever known. Emphasis is on individual impact, due to which there's lot of distrust within the team. No stack ranking, but a curve is implemented a org level. This is not a big deal in other companies but here it means 'out'. Managers main job is to write performance reviews, and this often leads to micro management that can be extremely frustrating to senior engineers. 

There's lot of work duplication, most managers (even directors) ignore it as performance reviews is all about impact. Most engineers know that everyone wants to write code and make impact, so ignore the code duplication.

Some teams are hiring just for the head count, not much impactful work. This becomes a problem for senior engineers as they have to invent work or get out. Before joining a team check out their roadmap for at least a year.

This is a good place if you want make money at the cost of WLB. Not a  place to be innovative, which inherently carries risk and takes time. It's a risk because if there's no impact you'll be fired. Most of the engineers work to satisfy performance reviews. My work is determined keeping performance review as the guideline.

Rampant hostile political atmosphere
Team leadership and IC's will undermine and berate service team members to push their agendas forward.  This is often overlooked by leaderhip and results in burnout and lack of empathy from everyone.  This in turn produces subpar results and half-baked solutions.  No one wins.

Sloppy processes
It's a benefit of a doubt to even say there are processes.  Most of the internal processes are poorly documented and no one has or wants to give time to onboard new hires (see comment below on the culture driving self-absorbed motives).  Getting anything done is 60% figuring out the best way forward, 20% fighting off the political backlash from making said decision and not the one the loudest stakeholder in the room wanted, and 20% is actually spent doing the work.  So much waste.  No concept of agile or the fundamentals of development practices in parts of Community Operations.

No humanity in the human facing part of the org
Working in Community Operations often felt like working in a call center.  People often don't care about their work and they don't care to look beyond the ""what's in it for me"" philosophy running the show to see the people that the organization is supposed to help.  We're talking about posts around some of the worst stuff out there- and the lack of empathy around it is nauseating and explains alot of the trouble Facebook has been getting into.

Custom everything means sloppy everything
So many of the internal tools are custom- even the ones that don't need to be!  Often the tools are under supported (or supported by a staff that isn't willing to take feedback) so you end up with subpar tools supporting a massive company that is in desperate need of some tools that are built with intent and full functionality behind them.

Culture breeds self-absorbed motives within people
Facebook's culture is oriented around ""impact""- what impact did YOU have this performance evaluation period.  It's not enough to say that you helped remove content that was harmful to minors (as an example unrelated to my direct experience).  The impact needs to tie back to numbers- how many lines of code, how much money was saved, how many productive hours were saved-- not one of the questions asked is about how it helps the PEOPLE that use Facebook.  It is all inward focused on the individual contributor- and as such the individual contributors act accordingly.  There is not team oriented thought or conduct in my experience across Community Ops.  There is only ""What's in it for me?"" 

HRBP are often ill informed on processes and policies and rotate like the second hand on a clock
You never know what you're going to get with the HRBP group- some are warm and empathetic others are very clearly only there to protect the company (meaning they'll pigeon hole you into a defensive position).  I didn't have a great experience with them and even in my exit process they got details wrong- like really important details.  Kind of disappointing. 

Middle management is hijacking the company for personal gain and Upper Management hasn't caught on yet
When I hear Mark talk- I see someone who really does believe in the mission behind the company- to make the world a more connected place.  But I'm not sure that he or his team see the snakes in the grass that are not aligned to that mission and only looking for ways to achieve their personal gain.

3472,1,Some adventures are not worth taking,"free food, free t-shirts, free laundry, good pay.
If you're right out of college, this might be the place for you, but that's mostly because you wont have much work experience to compare it against.","1) the job I got is not the job I thought I was getting:
  As an engineer, with engineer in the title, and over 10 years of experience, I really thought I would get to do more engineering.  Unfortunately, the job is really about 50% business analyst and 20% project management, and 30% engineering.  You are expected to own every aspect of your project, regardless if anyone else actually does.  Also, you're told you have the opportunity to choose the team you want to be on, but for me, that choice was removed at the last minute.

2) bad management, bad leadership - all managers are expected to be individual contributors which is basically another way of saying that they aren't particularly good at either, and do not have time to devote to both roles.  Also, be prepared for mansplaining.

3) more money than sense:  gobs and gobs of money are being thrown around.  there's basically an offsite every other week.  Nevermind about work, deadlines, or being competent, it's more important to go glassblowing.  The pay is nice, in fact, its the best feature about the place.

4) the company that wants to connect the world would rather loose talent than have remote workers.  no, seriously.  say you're on a team, and your team decides to move to another office thats like 1 hour away.  you are kicked off the team and put on another team.  what sense does that make?  new mom wants to wfh?  not allowed. 
 Seriously, it's called skype, people.  

5) and speaking of teams, the team structure is completely whack.  instead of having a core group of people I work with on many projects, I have a different group of people I work with on each project.  a completely different set of swe, pm, ds, and de for each project.  This completely limits our ability to grow more efficient with each project, let alone build any sort of a professional relationship.

6) you're not allowed to fix things that are legit broken.  I've only been here a short time and have already had to suffer fools who prefer poorly designed metrics with political bs to actually measuring things properly.  bug 1 told not to fix it - too big to fail, bug 2, never got fixed by other team, bug 3, too high profile to fix.  seriously?  why not just admit all your metrics are wrong?

7) people care more about performance reviews than actual performance.  no really, if I hear the phrase make ""an impact"" I will vom.  What this really means is not ""do good and useful work"" which is how it might be interpreted, instead it means that you should very little on the very high profile projects, and then post it everywhere, to make sure people NOTICE.  Also, keep a log of your work so that you can share it with your absentee manager come review time - otherwise, he (yeah I said he) likely will have no idea what you worked on or why.  But, instead of this being a meaningful signal, it just becomes more noise.",Data Engineer,Current Employee,"Menlo Park, CA","Nov 19, 2018"

You cant expect a 80k employees company to have the same culture throughout. Always speak to your direct team and managers before signing the offer. I can tell you that some team are unbearable. I am glad to have spoken to my manager before hand and choose the right one. But during my interview, I rejected the initial offer as I was speaking to some spiteful manager. The latest layoff, I see that the leadership team (C suite) didnt properly manage the process. There's a lot of frustration happens. My colleagues that we laid off up until the day it was announced, there's a lot of mis step. Decision was taken mainly due to the pressure from greedy shareholders as the Q3 revenue doesnt seems alarming as what mentioned by the leadership as well. I would say that, if you got job offer from Meta, if you are looking for a place that would provide better lifestyle especially in a short span, then definitely take it.

- The management in data centre does not embody Meta culture. The culture in data centre is worse than small medium enterprises. Employees are expected to be yes men, not to raise any questions or even provide feedback. You'll be targeted by management and your performance appraisal will suffer. 

- In the data centre, many perks given by Meta are not applicable to you if you are not a manager. Management said you are not to ""take advantage of the company "" so don't assume the perks such as Global travel days, or even claims of mileage for work purpose to be allowed. They will be rejected by your line manager.

- Overall culture is non-supportive and toxic with no flexibility. Expected to work in site office 5 days a week.

- Data centre hired people who aren't very competent or capable. It's really puzzling , guess the loop interview is not working. 

- No career progress, almost impossible to get promoted.

But again, this will feel repetitive and a lot of people comes out with useless projects just so that they outshine others. Team culture is very different from each team. You cant expect a 80k employees company to have the same culture throughout. Always speak to your direct team and managers before signing the offer. I can tell you that some team are unbearable. I am glad to have spoken to my manager before hand and choose the right one. But during my interview, I rejected the initial offer as I was speaking to some spiteful manager. The latest layoff, I see that the leadership team (C suite) didnt properly manage the process. There's a lot of frustration happens. My colleagues that we laid off up until the day it was announced, there's a lot of mis step. Decision was taken mainly due to the pressure from greedy shareholders as the Q3 revenue doesnt seems alarming as what mentioned by the leadership as well. I would say that, if you got job offer from Meta, if you are looking for a place that would provide better lifestyle especially in a short span, then definitely take it. But if you want to grow in a team that truly appreciate your opinion and voice, definitely avoid at all cause as they also ill informed the managers and made it very hard for leaders and managers to manage team's expectation",Technical Recruiter,Current Employee,"Dublin, Dublin","Dec 15, 2022"

Working-life balance can be challenging depending on your Manager and where your Team is based (US, Europe and/or Asia --> meeting can be quite early and/or quite late following the different time-zones). 
Performance are generally evaluated not (or not only) based on specific goals, but also based on what your colleagues from the same team on a global level have achieved compared to you (kind of benchmark performance review). So maybe your goal was X and you do X+10, but most of your teammates achieve X+30, so you can get a ""doesn't meet expectations"" on your review. And because of this, the environment tends to be more and more competitive (which maybe for someone can be a ""pros"")",Anonymous Employee,Current Employee,"Dublin, Dublin","Jan 18, 2022"

This becomes unhearthy, as work and life balance suffers, pressure increases and you end up receiving less compensation for what's essentially the same work.

Also, there's a MASSIVE disconnect between ""everything proprietary internal"" and ""the real world"", so the longer you work for the company, the more distant you are from skills and tools that'll use at your next job, as most of what was learned, is essentially lost.

The project has lost most of its key personnel because the Director for Product was unable to give a clear direction, and censored all the reasonable ideas. My manager was inexperienced and refused to hear any suggestion that I made. It felt really demoralising and frustrating. I reached out to other managers, friends from previous job who agreed that it was frustrating… but that’s it.
– I agree, this is a horrible situation.
– What can I do about it?
– I don’t know…
– Wait a year, so I can change teams?
– Maybe. That was changed to 18 months though.

All three of the Org, the project and my manager had ""the worst Pulse rating in the history of the company"" at their level, according to people who had been at Facebook longer. No one reached out.

Several key stakeholders left, notably one senior Data engineer. I offered to take over some of their workload because I knew how and I badly needed data to do my own work. That was yet another suggestion that my manager shut down.

But the most frustrating feeling of all was that I didn't see anyone try to innovate in any way.

* I've worked with some of the nicest and most engaged hiring managers here that helped solve recruiting challenges 
* Recruiting tools are literally the best in the business.","* The pressure to perform is insane; hitting my target + delivering on projects was just barely enough to get a meets all during the perf cycle
* Roles are becoming increasingly small and marginalised as the team continues to scale. As a result, you see people jumping (literally) on to projects to set themselves apart from the rest of the team. It makes for a bit of a cut-throat culture just around the time when PSC hits
 * If you're interviewing at facebook, prepare for a ride with R4R - they'll probably won't speak to you again after you've signed the contract
* While there are exceptions, the culture in the recruiting team is just weird. It sort of reminds me of high school. There's cliques, people gossip and there's for sure a couple of bullies: either people wouldn't even say a word to you or would go out of their way to make you feel like you're weird or different (to be honest, that also included my manager).
* Ads Credits & being forced to dog-food beta apps: I'm a huge instagram fan and big user - so being forced to update my apps multiple times a day was a nightmare.
* The perks are nice but salary/bonus are nothing to write home about: base is somewhat competitive but expect around 85-90% of the bonus you're promised in your offer letter.",Technical Sourcer,Former Employee,"London, England","Oct 22, 2019"

 1)Management:  Inexpert management, really superficial and high level approach, luck of clear direction, unprofessional jokes and attitude, play favourites, only interest in their own goals and not the development of the team
- Lack of structure: No processes & structures, many teams have been created without a prior consultant opinion. So many people, me included, have been obliged to work in a team not fitting their skills.
- Not all the opinions are heard: If you try to propose new projects ideas and . process you can result annoying. They ask people of higher level to be independent and drive their own initiatives, but at the end the managers decide and promote only the people that help them to reach their own goals.

The work is challenging and interesting and the social aspect is great too; there's always something to get involved with should you want to. They provide free breakfast, lunch and dinner which is pretty amazing.

2. The talent across Hyderabad floor and across international offices (I have visited 2) are extremely mediocre, essentially because of point number 1.

Better than I could have possibly imagined.","Instead of completing a formal review, I’ll share a post I made to celebrate my 1 year anniversary since joining Facebook.

Today marks my first year at Facebook. We call it a Faceversary. And, while celebrating your work 
anniversary might seem a bit frivolous (or at least I thought so early on), I quickly learned to appreciate the FB tradition that’s built around these Faceversaries. It’s valuable to reflect on all that happens in a year at work, considering how much energy, time, and effort we put into it. 

When you make it to your 10-year milestone (my count down starts now), you get the opportunity to join Mark Zuckerberg, Sheryl Sandberg, and others on the management team to tell a 10-year Faceversary story to the entire company. Those are always funny or emotional, or both. 
 
So, what can I share after my first year here? 
 
TL;DR: Work with and learn from the very best people. Drinking from the firehose and learning a ton. Autonomy, authority and support. World-class benefits. Open culture to the bones. An inside look at how serious everyone is about minimizing the bad and building more of the good. Five core values in action. Pretty darn happy. 
 
I get the pleasure to work with incredible, impressive, and talented people daily. Both within the walls of Facebook, but also with clients and partners who are working on some unbelievable things. My pod and my core team are just legendary. This isn’t lip service. I really get to work with and learn from the very best. 
 
I’ve learnt SO MUCH. About digital advertising and marketing. About financial services. About media. About other industry verticals I previously knew nothing about. About navigating complex circumstances. About working for a company that’s constantly in the spotlight. About digging deeper to really understand. About cross-functional collaboration. About partnerships. About technology. And much more. Internally, they say every day at Facebook is equivalent to a week. I now know why. 
 
I have the autonomy, authority, and support I need to be successful and run my marketing consulting business the way I see fit. Further, I get to shape and influence how businesses engage, nurture, and build new relationships with people.

I have access to incredible benefits that I’m astonished by daily and so grateful for. In fact, I’m writing this post while on paid paternity leave to spend time with my family and our new addition, Logan. 
 
Facebook fosters an open culture that is like nothing I’ve ever seen before. Mark hosts a weekly company-wide Q&A where he addresses thoughtful and difficult questions about a wide-range of issues and opportunities. Everyone, from Interns to tenured employees, are welcome to ask anything and they don’t face judgement or criticism for raising difficult topics. On our internal Workplace (Facebook for Work), I can join and learn about a whole host of interesting projects, regardless of whether I’m involved in them. 
 
I’ve learnt a lot about both the harmful ways and the incredibly positive ways Facebook can be used. I get a firsthand look at how serious everyone is about minimizing the bad and building more of the good.

There are 5 core values that guide how we work at Facebook. And I see them in practice regularly. Build social value. Move fast. Be bold. Be open. Focus on impact.

Unique opportunities with an ability to learn on a daily basis, really building up your resume with an ability to fill any gap with new experiences.

This sounds incredible, but it's true. Decisions are taken as part of cross-functional meetings where everyone has an opinion and nobody is really driving.

The working environment is collaborative, open and focused on impact. 

People. Some of the smartest people I have ever had a chance to deal with. Hard-working, fun, collaborative, creative and driven. They are not all made from the same mold and diversity is important. In Dublin, I love the multicultural environment, it is respectful of everyone's culture and creates a great vibe around the office. 

Perks. Alright so the initial salary is not the highest compared to other companies I have worked for. However, the 6 monthly bonuses (performance based), stock, salary adjustment every year, free healthy delicious food all day really add up. I have had higher base salaries in previous jobs, but going to work every day without fearing what the day brings, and lower stress-levels are just priceless. Also put in the Irish/Dublin context (very very grim unemployment figures), it is a solid job with career prospects. 

What we do. Putting aside the people, the cool office and many perks, I really love what I do. We support hundreds of million users across EMEA/Latin America, and working on such a scale is inspiring.  I feel immensely proud of what we are achieving every day.","Work life balance can be at times poor. No one is really putting a gun to my head to work this hard, but I feel a sense of duty to our teams and our users.

5987,4,Satisfied Ex-Employee,"Great work culture. They literally move fast. Things get done very quickly. People are helpful, and some of the best people you'll meet.","The ambiguity in work sometimes gets to you. No career path, and proper mentoring that you can claim. Everything with regards to personal or career development is laden with jargon and hyperbole in discussions.

5988,5,"Driven, sharp yet friendly people all working seriously hard towards a goal we all believe in.","The atmosphere is amazing. Everyone pulling together to help the company achieve goals we all believe in, while being incredibly open, down-to-earth and helpful about it. Amazed how everyone pitches in to help, there is very little politics and good things happen all the time. Plus the benefits are excellent - so much is taken care of so that you can focus on making an impact.","Lack of structure makes it hard to find your place, but once you're there, it's great. Getting fat from all the food.",,Current Employee,"London, England","Mar 23, 2012"
5989,2,"A toxic, cult-like environment","Facebook has a lot of money to throw around, so you get great benefits and perks. Office spaces are nice, the benefits are really good, plus they continuously update their 'Life@' perks which can be handy and convenient.","The worst part about Facebook is the culture. With the excuse that you should 'focus on impact', people will fight for 'sexy' projects and things that will obtain them a good performance review. Since middle and upper management often do not have a clue about what their own teams actually do, whatever you can make sound important (e.g. with fake metrics or tales of potential impact), you are onto a winner. Unfortunately, the same managers do not enforce a culture of fairness or trust; instead, it is a culture of rewarding back-stabbers and people who 'get the work done' but who, at the same time, treat their colleagues poorly. By that, I mean stealing projects or not giving credit to those who get the work done, for example. It is an awful environment to work in. Some teams are worse than others as well: You could end up reporting into a bad apple who steals projects from you. It happens, and it happens often.

Good people managers are never rewarded, as people management is not something Facebook recognises as important. Yes, in the orientation they will give you a big speech about it but when was the last time good people managers got promotions? Managers should focus on people, and ICs should focus on things. Unfortunately, bad managers who are good at IC work get rewarded often to the detriment of their teams, who have to suffer under people who should have never become people managers. The so-called Pulse survey is a joke, as no importance is given to low-scoring managers. If 10 people in a team say they would not work with their manager again, something must be wrong, don't you think? 

To any potential employees: Do not get fooled by the appearances. Facebook makes people feel trapped because they make you think this is the 'best' company and that you should be grateful you are part of Mark Zuckerberg's dream of making the world more 'open and connected'. It's a fallacy. Do not fall for it.",Anonymous Employee,Current Employee,"Dublin, Dublin","Sep 17, 2018"

Sr. Management is well aware of the areas to improve flagged repeatedly by the team but almost no changes are made. Performance evaluation random and highly driven by Management's perception of the person rather than basing it Impact  on the job.

> Real flat organisation: many other companies misinterprete what employees mean by 'flat organisation' - they are not talking about the number levels between junior and senior people, but on how open senior leadership is. FB doesn't make that mistake, you can talk to anybody here, from managers to directors and VPs and they all listen to you attentively, as a peer, not as a 'superior'. Employees at FB are all valued the same.

> Perks are amazing: it is not about the amount of perks, but how those perks make your life much better.

I love this mission and while I've worked in other great companies in the past with great missions too - this by far - is the mission that relates most to me as an individual. It's powerful. It's empowering. It's enriching. It's transformative. Not just for me but  for so many people we share the world with today but also tomorrow. What I love about it is I believe Facebook and its family of apps: Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp, etc, and other technologies like it from other companies are transforming the medium of language, the medium of communication. I can remember being a young boy in the early 80's in a small city called Waterford, in the south of Ireland,  being excited when introduced to the humble CD for the first time. I remember clearly the first mobile brick hand-phones, mpeg players, ipods, on and on and on. With the advent of AR/VR and the proliferation global messaging apps that connect huge parts of the world today I'm feeling a similar excitement here seeing first hand the impact these technologes are having for billions of people on the planet. I'm really enjoying being in a company not just playing a huge part in this evolutionary transformation but doing so in a company from what I can see so far is doing so with real respect for its employees. The work environment is safe, collaborative and fair. There are large degrees of flexibility, autonomy and transparency. Folks are humble and authentic, at least the ones I've all met so far, and they deeply care about their work and those people around them.

- Free Food
- Health Insurance but you'll need it due to issues this place causes
- Meet lots of cool people
- Good for your first job but if you are experienced coming from the outside be very careful as they don't value this.
- The FB expe","1. Work/Life Balance
If you don't make this boundary clear yourself and actively work on creating it - it will be exploited. Communication is broken in the company so you'll get messenger pings, quip notifications, emails, google doc updates at all hours. They even do long term project planning over chat groups in some teams.

2. Loads of unnecessary stress/anxiety related issues suffered by employees due to: 
(i) Managers fawning over each other showing ""impact"" of their teams - god help you if you don't make them look good or disagree with them. Anonymous reviews come through some of the time and people can say what they want about you.
(ii) Unnecessary fighting between individual contributors due to performance review system. People ""strong arm"" you into doing work when it makes no business sense so it can make them look good.
(iii) Bad reviews stick with you and you'll be treated differently - people are managed out/disappear/don't pass probation all the time. Speaking with friends in other companies FB isn't that attractive anymore and it's reputation is changing in the jobs marketplace.
(iv) Performance reviews for the most part are opinion based (see 3 below) and not work based
(v) Bullying/Level-ism. I've seen so much of it go on here and nothing done.
(vi) Decisions a lot of the time are made from MPK and a lot of the time opinion based and not fact based which is scary. The 'Holier Than Though' engineering 'Move Fast' culture creates loads of chaos and is unnecessary.

3. You are goaled a lot on ""collaboration"" i.e. how much you are liked rather than the work you do or numbers you drive. This is a cult like characteristic where you have to be ""happy"" and ""always on."" I joined FB to work on projects to drive numbers but all my feedback was about how I got on with other people. Collaboration is important for most companies but it's fake at Facebook due to performance review system.

4. There are no formal processes for a lot of things in the company. The only analogy I have for Facebook is that it's like a big building, you go inside, peel back the wallpaper and all you will see is the pipes - the walls are missing. It's ""XFN this"" and ""XFN that"" so you reach out to teams to get things done and rely on ""collaboration"" rather than formal processes/business requirements. It's a huge surprise to me how it has gotten this far. I've seen parts of the operation down/backlogged for weeks on end due to bad planning but you can't complain about it because you won't be ""liked.""

- Free Food
- Health Insurance but you'll need it due to issues this place causes
- Meet lots of cool people
- Good for your first job but if you are experienced coming from the outside be very careful as they don't value this.
- The FB expe","1. Work/Life Balance
If you don't make this boundary clear yourself and actively work on creating it - it will be exploited. Communication is broken in the company so you'll get messenger pings, quip notifications, emails, google doc updates at all hours. They even do long term project planning over chat groups in some teams.

2. Loads of unnecessary stress/anxiety related issues suffered by employees due to: 
(i) Managers fawning over each other showing ""impact"" of their teams - god help you if you don't make them look good or disagree with them. Anonymous reviews come through some of the time and people can say what they want about you.
(ii) Unnecessary fighting between individual contributors due to performance review system. People ""strong arm"" you into doing work when it makes no business sense so it can make them look good.
(iii) Bad reviews stick with you and you'll be treated differently - people are managed out/disappear/don't pass probation all the time. Speaking with friends in other companies FB isn't that attractive anymore and it's reputation is changing in the jobs marketplace.
(iv) Performance reviews for the most part are opinion based (see 3 below) and not work based
(v) Bullying/Level-ism. I've seen so much of it go on here and nothing done.
(vi) Decisions a lot of the time are made from MPK and a lot of the time opinion based and not fact based which is scary. The 'Holier Than Though' engineering 'Move Fast' culture creates loads of chaos and is unnecessary.

3. You are goaled a lot on ""collaboration"" i.e. how much you are liked rather than the work you do or numbers you drive. This is a cult like characteristic where you have to be ""happy"" and ""always on."" I joined FB to work on projects to drive numbers but all my feedback was about how I got on with other people. Collaboration is important for most companies but it's fake at Facebook due to performance review system.

4. There are no formal processes for a lot of things in the company. The only analogy I have for Facebook is that it's like a big building, you go inside, peel back the wallpaper and all you will see is the pipes - the walls are missing. It's ""XFN this"" and ""XFN that"" so you reach out to teams to get things done and rely on ""collaboration"" rather than formal processes/business requirements. It's a huge surprise to me how it has gotten this far. I've seen parts of the operation down/backlogged for weeks on end due to bad planning but you can't complain about it because you won't be ""liked.""

5. GMS Summit - This event is a mix between Jonestown and being in North Korea. People stand up and applaud Zuckerberg when he comes on stage and don't sit down until he sits down.
