3,"Amazon is doing lot's of cool stuff...but lots of boring stuff too.  There are really well run teams...and very badly run teams.  The experience for software managers and engineers is all over the board, from really run low operational load teams to teams where people burn out after a year.

 - Amazon is built, quite deliberately, to be Darwinian.  You can generally expect that anyone who's been here for more than 2 years is competent and motivated or they wouldn't have survived.  You can count on them as long as your priorities are aligned.  There aren't many slackers here, and they don't survive long.
  - We work on so much stuff that there's always an opportunity to find amazing cool stuff to work on (note that it's an 'opportunity', one that you have to pursue)
  - A chance to make a huge difference
  - A place where you can learn a lot about all kinds of things, both technical and about yourself
  - Amazon encourages high mobility - even your manager can't prevent you from moving to another team within 6 weeks (normally, more than a few months under unusual conditions).
  - Your friends and family have actually heard of the place you work and have at least a vague notion of what Amazon does without you having to explain","- You're responsible for your own career progression and finding the places and teams that are doing the stuff you want to do. No one is going to take you by the hand and help you with that.
- Amazon is built, quite deliberately, to be Darwinian. The strong survive and the weak perish (metaphorically speaking) and the 'bar' is constantly increasing. The level of performance that would have been acceptable five years ago will get you canned today.  It's a kind of crucible that'll help you develop a harder edge, if you can survive, that can serve you well in your career and in life, but it's often not a pleasant experience.

I wouldn't recommend it as a place to work for just anyone.",4.0
4,"I've been at Amazon for a month now, and I've seen none of the horror stories being communicated to the public, although Amazon is a large enough company that I'm sure there are good pockets and bad pockets. Everyone here is really smart, and wants to succeed both personally, and as a company. People collaborate and help each other, focus on data, and truly focus on the customer. Every company I've ever worked for talks about how important the customer is, but on day 2, they're forgotten. Amazon seems to genuinely focus on what's best for the customer, and it's awesome to be in meetings where people actually bring that up, and make decisions focused on long-term customer satisfaction.

The opportunities to learn here are literally unlimited, and the opportunity to take on new responsibility is as well. I honestly believe you can be as awesome as you want here.","No cons, so far - seriously. Like I said, I'm sure Amazon has some bad pockets in it here and there, but this is an amazing job, an amazing opportunity, and the biggest thing I have to complain about is that it's a little chilly in our building. I can live with that.

Does Amazon demand high quality, measurable results? Yes! Is it hard work? Yes! Is it rewarding? Yes! So I'm not calling that a 'con'. Work/life balance seems comparable to other places I've worked - not worse.",5.0

6,This company gets A list performance from C list employees.  The culture is quick and hard charging.  You are always working in relevant and meaningful projects.,"Maybe because the company recruits C listers who have neither merit (intelligence, strategic vision) nor pedigree (academic or professional accomplishments), most of those who become successful do so in treacherous, low cunning ways.

Imagine the Lannisters in Game of Thrones attacking the Starks in Game of Thrones; or Rawls and Burrell attacking McNulty and Daniels in The Wire; or Barrow and O'Brien attacking Mr Bates in Downton Abbey.  This is every day leadership behavior at Amazon.  The culture at Amazon is so infested with these middling talent weasels who have juked the stats and schemed their way to positions of power that new employees coming in actually start thinking that this behavior is normal and expected if you want to ""manage people.""

The work itself was stimulating and fulfilling, but the sneering condescension of the d bags that cheated and skated their way through high school and party colleges, then just converted their winky nod nod good 'ol boy shenanigans into a ""ask no questions, have no introspection"" company culture have made manifest some of the worst criticisms of capitalism.  Any left leaning political aspirant would look at this business organism and immediately have content to lash out against the corruption that can come in free enterprise where hard work is not rewarded, and the connected, incestuous, privileged class lounge their way to wealth while treating their employees and customers like some kind of filth their shoe picked up on the street.",4.0

8,"Disclaimer: My opinions reflect that of an SDE in Amazon. Seems like some operational job functions are very tough.

I have read through some of the other Amazon reviews and it seems to me that everyone has a very different experience! This is so true. Within the same team, you can have both workaholics and slackers coexisting and coworking together. I think I am more of the balanced type as I try to stay sane. The Amazon experience is basically the entire spectrum and it is what you make it out to be.

Pros in Amazon certainly excludes great benefits, but compensation is competitive. Free food means average quality free coffee, once in a while free pizza for lunch where it is a working lunch, and free beer and finger food in special events. We get a free Orca card to take any bus in the Seattle area for free. $160 per month subsidy for office parking, which is better than nothing. Downtown monthly parking goes for about $200 per month. 401K contribution is 50% of what you put in, where you can put in max 4% of your salary. Not so great. Staff cafeteria food is average and not at all cheaper than outside food, or could be even more expensive. It is hard not to complain about the cafeteria. Vacation days are ok but note that there are no sick leaves. They count as part of your 5 personal days per year. Listing the benefits of Amazon is like listing the cons and not the pros.

Work life balance seems to be ok for the most part, and seems to be individually-driven. No one will tell you that you have to come in at what time and stay till what time. I have team mates working every night and weekend, and others getting in at 10am and leaving at 5pm, all in the same team. Managers will focus on your project deliveries instead of how much time you spend working. If you work 40-hour weeks productively, you can definitely outperform someone who works 60-hour weeks but don't deliver stuff. Working less than 40 hours per week is somewhat common, but I can't say how many people are working how long. The view on work life balance is a bit skewed. All it comes down to are the managers and what they think. Projects are always never-ending but I have found that deadlines are very realistic and reasonable, without counting your nights and weekends. Getting some slack time once in a while is probably a sign of a healthy work environment. Everyone needs a break.

On-call really really sucks. Basically all it comes down to is having SDEs double-duty as support operations engineers. Note that on-call does not improve the code quality of any team in any way. The on-call experience is particularly bad because you are using services from some other team, and their code is of low quality and fails for the wrong reasons. If the managers had given more time to up the quality, there would not be so many problems. Software is usually delivered with a tough deadline with code that meets the minimum quality bar and never gets improved for the next few years. The code review process does not seem to help improve the code but it really obstructs developers from making great changes as unconventional things will not pass code review in clumsy minds. Innovation and excellence are not the name of the game in Amazon. Searching through the Amazon code base is usually not going to turn up quality code that you can actually reuse.

Integration is the name of the game in Amazon. You will need to spend a lot of time to figure out how to integrate your code with another team's services. Whether these other people are cooperative is a hit-or-miss. I have found that most people are responsive and helpful, but there are also quite a number of jerks who are out to make trouble for everybody. It is not easy to work across teams but the experience is mostly positive.

Amazon is a huge behemoth and is hiring people like there is no tomorrow. This reflects well on a good growth momentum but also is worrying that the company is not turning much profit. If the company does not make money, where is our bonus going to come from? You can see new faces around the Amazon building almost everyday! Downside is that we are taking in a lot of average to above-average engineers and being an Amazonian SDE certainly does not share the same reputation as the top names. Amazon is a huge mixed bag of some very talented people and some very dumb people. I think the world is not turning up enough SDEs and the only way is for quality to go downhill.

As an SDE, expect to spend most of your time talking, writing emails and documents, and maybe around 20-30% of your time coding. In most of the teams, you can work on interesting projects, but probably not revolutionary ones. Note that Amazon is a very down-to-earth company and the work is very down-to-earth as well. You will work on real things that people have actually requested for, and that people will start using as soon as you are done. Work is challenging but not to expect highly technically complex stuff. Most of the work has to do with solving everyday problems. To me, this seems to make sense because I have ever tried working on experimental projects before elsewhere and I did not feel it was a good use of my time.

Internal mobility is a key strength of Amazon, and I am not sure which company has done better than Amazon in this aspect. Internal moves are easy. You only need to stay in your team for a year before moving to a different team. There is no easy way to tell which team is a good team to move to because they all have their different pros and cons and people and coming and leaving all the time!

Seattle is by much rumour an easier place to live than the Bay area.

Overall Amazon is a tough but yet sane place to work. The flexibility of this company is really its core strength. You have the freedom to excel as much as you want and also to slack as much as you want. Bummer. You shouldn't be slacking!","Beware of bad managers and horrible team mates. They are not specific to Amazon but they do exist in Amazon.

I have to admit that Monday is usually a blue day at Amazon and it is very tough to look forward to getting into office. I don't know anyone in Amazon who looks forward to getting in on Mondays.

Be realistic about SDE requirements. Coding skills are good to have but they are not the most important part of your job. I think we are hearing the same thing from every company.

Medical coverage is average or below average. Expect to pay about $60 per month for singles and about $240 per month for families. $240 per month for families gives you $3000 in medical fees before you have to pay (more) anything out-of-pocket.

SDE advancement is unreal difficult. They have about 6 levels total, SDE 1-4, then Senior Principal Engineer, and finally Distinguished Engineer. The number of SDE 1s and 2s are huge. Trying to get to SDE 3 seems to be all-of-a-sudden extremely difficult, but not impossible. So this essentially means that if you come to Amazon as a fresh grad SDE, expect to get about only one or two promotions in your entire career, which obviously is quite a lame expectation and reality. You will probably do much better in your career advancement anywhere else.

Employee retention is horrible. I am not sure why the philosophy seems to be trying to undercut existing employees and then hire from external sources. Management all say that they are trying to retain people, but actions don't seem to suggest anything better. Rumour has it that annual pay raises are horrible. This basically mean that either you are a superstar in the company before they will try to retain you, or if you are smart you should not stay in Amazon for too long.",4.0
9,"Great starting pay and the ability to get raises very quickly.

Beat benefits as well once you are a hired on as a full time employee.","After 3 years of working with the company you ""cap out"" at $15.75, meaning you can no longer make any more money than that as a tier 1 associate.

Career growth: Applied Scientists are in high demand in many industries, and the job outlook for this field is promising, providing opportunities for career growth and advancement.","Pressure to deliver results: Applied Scientists are often tasked with delivering results under tight deadlines and high expectations, which can be stressful and demanding. Ambiguity: Applied Scientists may encounter ambiguity in the problem definition or data interpretation, requiring them to make assumptions and trade-offs that can affect the results. Technical skills required: Applied Scientists need to have a strong foundation in technical skills, such as statistics, programming, or experimental design, which may require significant time and effort to acquire. Limited creativity: Applied Scientists may face constraints in the problem-solving process, such as budget or time limitations, which may limit their creativity and innovative ideas. Competitive market: Applied Scientists are in high demand, but the competition for jobs in this field can be intense, requiring a high level of qualifications and experience.",5.0
12,Was a stable job and had some liberty to solve many problems with the maintenance and safety guys. Free snacks once and a while. No need to have to talk much to anybody during shift and could focus on what's best task priority for the good of the employees/company safety and performance. The big Pro at Amazon was that after having a work sprint from a few minutes to hours depending the situation I was able to have a few minutes to recover. Simple thing make a huge difference in working conditions....unlike other Amazon workers working non-stop.,The communication between managers and our team was 3 to 5 days delayed and lead to aggravation and big foot decision interfering with our work even if safety could be at risk. That tells a lot about the station manager and his lieutenant background about their competences to manage their team and truck drivers safely and fairly. Doing a speech at the begining of a shift but taking wrong decision to terminate an employee don't make a manager competent or help the company at all !,3.0

Best way to maintain your production and achieve the fastest time is by waiting till break and never stop stowing The biggest Con for me was during my time of employment I was dealing with depression and mental health problems due to losing one of the greatest friends/mentor, my sister who left behind a beautiful daughter. Sense this was the most traumatic thing that's could possibly happen I took a medical leave for a mental health program at Bradford. Well after completing the course I uploaded my documents to return to work. And the ERC Kept requesting more info and my doctor wouldn't allow it says that's all the information they need so after 4 months of being off the schedule I finally got erc to accept it but then my a to z app never put me back on the schedule.

Pay is also not location based which does not make any sense considering it is a fully-onsite role. There is ZERO ability for negotiation or discussions about pay raises at least from L1 - L4. Many issues with the promotion system. If you even want to get to L5 in HR, you must invent some problem and act the hell out of a pretend solution. I am not supposed to be an actor, I am supposed to be doing HR work. They don't accept great work and the obvious ability to perform at the next level. Not to mention the difference between HRP and HRBP (L5) is just that they attend reginal meetings presenting the data that you gave them... You also will not be promoted unless you manager is willing to vouch for you, so you will have to kiss-up to them and basically beg for a ""promo-doc"". They will make up reasons to say you are not ready, even if they have said over and over that they have no feedback for you and you are a superstar and the best on the team. Many people spend over a year in ""stretch roles"" where they are not given any extra pay or given a title increase but are doing the work of the next level. And they are still not guaranteed that promotion when time comes. Seen more than one get passed up for an outside hire. Absolute nonsense. If your in Sr. leadership and your building metrics are not the best more than a few times, they will fire you. Doesn't matter the reason why the metrics are not met. This on top of already terrible turnover rates mean I have had 3-4 HRBPs in 2 years and about 5 site leaders. This is not to mention the desk work makes you wan to jump off a cliff. Anyone can be hired as an associate and they will drive you crazy. The turnover rate is insane for T1s and they act like it's HR's fault for not having enough pizza parties and bingo days. This means there are always new people who have questions everyday. Associates will fight each other and do other nonsense that makes your job so much harder. The bigger the building the worse the problems, but at least they have more HR. Small buildings are ""at gearing ratio"" but there is too much work and the small HR teams cannot keep up. Ultimately, not worth the amount of hoops they make you jump through. I hear that the higher levels 5/6+ outside of the warehouse are much more reasonable. So, if you want to work for Amazon, come here to get your foot in the door with HR if you can handle the schedule and low pay in high COL areas (ie. no kids) then get a better position and boomerang back to in a few years.

The times I had good managers, I was able to do great work and get the resources I needed. - Lots of resources for training, skill improvement, etc. - A very robust remote work system - obviously of only limited usefulness because they want people in the office three days a week, but on days when you do work outside your office, the system works incredibly well. It's even good enough that you can register your own laptop as an Amazon laptop and get it wiped when you're done. - The on-call process is surprisingly pleasant. Each team member takes a 1-week turn with on-call, and if your code is built so that breaking changes are difficult to get into prod (which most of them are), you will very rarely be paged after hours, if at all.","- If you _don't_ have a good manager (perhaps because they don't get you, don't respect your time, can't stand up to demanding PMs) then you will have an awful experience. And unfortunately, Amazon has enough internal reorgs that you really don't have control of who your manager is. - I couldn't help but feel like I was in a cult the whole time. The ""leadership principles"" feel like dogmatic recitations, they always insisted that you were the best due to their rigorous interview process (which honestly didn't feel nearly rigorous enough after seeing it from the inside), and it was nearly impossible to have any insight into what upper management thought, especially when it came to salary and performance reviews. - Lots of theater for code changes, especially new deployments.

One of the most toe curling experiences from this job was their decision to move stylists to a bidding scheduling system which made some employees no longer have 8 hours to work in one day.

Upper management has this way of making you feel like you are close to getting a promotion and then giving it to someone else. If you think you can move up the ranks in amazon just remember it's not about how good you are at your job. It literally about who you know and who likes you. People are very petty there and will stop you from getting a promotion especially if they are of higher ranking. The pay is also inadequate of the amount of work you do and the hours you work.

RSU grants don’t start to vest for 2 years. If you leave the company before then, for any reason whether voluntary or involuntary, they’re gone and go back into the company’s pocket.

150,"As an ontologist, there aren't many places you can be hired where you have a lot of other people in the same job family. The ontologist community here is more relaxed and welcoming than I expected at Amazon. I had anticipated Amazon would be more ""churn and burn"".

Good on-ramping time and materials. The company doesn't ask too much of me too soon, and the training is high in production value and usually relevant to what I do. Once you're in, the company is large with a lot of different things you could do. So, if you don't find the perfect fit when you first join, transferring is very possible and common. Getting in the door is the hardest part. Pay and benefits were competitive, in my experience. I don't think that is a universal experience, though.","The systems at Amazon are very unique to Amazon. It's unlikely that you'll come here and be able to hit the ground running on building the taxonomy. OWL skills, for instance, aren't very applicable at this point.

Most of the time promotions is not based no talent, but based on popularity of who the SR/OM likes. While the job has some cons, I spend most of my time trying to get people to do their job. At times Amazon can feel like a huge Adult Highschool. We have high standards on hiring external talents, but will promote anyone internally to the same position (AMs) with no experience. Too many internal politics inside the FC. Lack of diversity in high roles this includes women and POC. At times it’s like real talent is not valued. Amazon will promote anyone in any role just based off seniority and not talent. You really don’t need a degree to do this job. All you need is really good people skills. I don’t mind the schedule it’s 10–12-hour days 4 days a week with 3 off. Most of the time is spent engaging associates or completing Admin work. At times the job can get very boring at times. Conflict with other manages are common on shift. Amazon creates a culture where managers don’t work tighter but compete against each other. I can tell you that if you are hired as an L4 Manager an make it 1 year promotion L5 role is a given performance really don’t matter. Most managers are L5 and everybody want’s to be an L6 yet lack experience to do the role. Great job to start and move to different positions, while a degree is not required it help as most Sr/GM have college degrees. Managers should work more together/ Amazon needs more Women in leadership roles, also not a lot Amazon can do about the Highschool Culture inside it’s FCs. This happens when you allow almost anyone to work at Amazon without interviewing. This Highschool culture is from PAs/AMs/OMs I’m sure this is at most sites. I will tell you the best thing about Amazon they really do promote Anyone. Someone who didn’t graduate HS/ or only have a HS diploma this job would be the best thing for them. You really can start as a T1 and make it to an L6 within five years if you know the right people. Everybody wants a management role at Amazon but lack experience with dealing with people.

Pay is also not location based which does not make any sense considering it is a fully-onsite role. There is ZERO ability for negotiation or discussions about pay raises at least from L1 - L4. Many issues with the promotion system. If you even want to get to L5 in HR, you must invent some problem and act the hell out of a pretend solution. I am not supposed to be an actor, I am supposed to be doing HR work. They don't accept great work and the obvious ability to perform at the next level. Not to mention the difference between HRP and HRBP (L5) is just that they attend reginal meetings presenting the data that you gave them... You also will not be promoted unless you manager is willing to vouch for you, so you will have to kiss-up to them and basically beg for a ""promo-doc"". They will make up reasons to say you are not ready, even if they have said over and over that they have no feedback for you and you are a superstar and the best on the team. Many people spend over a year in ""stretch roles"" where they are not given any extra pay or given a title increase but are doing the work of the next level. And they are still not guaranteed that promotion when time comes. Seen more than one get passed up for an outside hire. Absolute nonsense. If your in Sr. leadership and your building metrics are not the best more than a few times, they will fire you. Doesn't matter the reason why the metrics are not met. This on top of already terrible turnover rates mean I have had 3-4 HRBPs in 2 years and about 5 site leaders. This is not to mention the desk work makes you wan to jump off a cliff. Anyone can be hired as an associate and they will drive you crazy. The turnover rate is insane for T1s and they act like it's HR's fault for not having enough pizza parties and bingo days. This means there are always new people who have questions everyday. Associates will fight each other and do other nonsense that makes your job so much harder. The bigger the building the worse the problems, but at least they have more HR. Small buildings are ""at gearing ratio"" but there is too much work and the small HR teams cannot keep up. Ultimately, not worth the amount of hoops they make you jump through. I hear that the higher levels 5/6+ outside of the warehouse are much more reasonable. So, if you want to work for Amazon, come here to get your foot in the door with HR if you can handle the schedule and low pay in high COL areas (ie. no kids) then get a better position and boomerang back to in a few years.

Upper management has this way of making you feel like you are close to getting a promotion and then giving it to someone else. If you think you can move up the ranks in amazon just remember it's not about how good you are at your job. It literally about who you know and who likes you. People are very petty there and will stop you from getting a promotion especially if they are of higher ranking. The pay is also inadequate of the amount of work you do and the hours you work.

Teams and individuals are encouraged to quickly adapt to changing priorities, which can be a pro for some but may not be suitable for everyone. The ""Correction of Errors"" process helps eliminate the blame game that often occurs during outages at other companies. Working in networking at Amazon offers unique and challenging problems that are difficult to find elsewhere. NDEs (network development engineers) are given the opportunity to work on the problems that interest them, even if it means switching teams. The company has high hiring standards, which means you'll be surrounded by bright and diverse individuals.","The constant change of priorities can have negative side-effects. Your project might have its scope altered or even cancelled altogether. The company's organizational structure has changed every 3 years or so, and there's often a trade-off between long-term personal development and short-term goals. If you're interested in pursuing non-Amazon technical development or certifications, be prepared to invest personal time and money. The combined effect of these factors has made my experience disappointing. I've reported to seven different managers in my time with the company, which has made it difficult to advance. However, experiences at Amazon vary widely depending on your team and focus, and some teams are better than others. I strongly recommend vetting your manager and team thoroughly before accepting a position. Finally, the scale of Amazon requires teams to focus on a smaller part of the bigger picture, which can result in siloed teams and individuals. Some teams do a good job of balancing their narrow focus with a broader perspective, but this is not always the case, especially in networking.",4.0

Most importantly, you are compensated for what you do in a very data-driven way, there is no convoluted paths for promotion and the culture is almost of an almost utopian meritocracy.","Not a con per se, but I have known many people who are just looking for a 9-17 job, same same every day, a comfortable safe position in a giant company. This is not what Amazon is about. We want you to grow from day one. The company has a place for people of all walks of life, but you have to be ambitious, driven and willing to put the effort. Sometimes it is hard to be motivated by a greater purpose of the company. I would say that the best outcomes of Amazon to the world are by-products of its core services (setting a legitimate customer-oriented standard for corporations, promoting an engaging and inclusive work environment, enabling people to do more dignified jobs by automating trivial work, optimizing logistics and distribution of goods with technology, etc...).

They have vending machines with gear like gloves and orange safety vests in case you lose yours. because I scanned over 350-450 packages my picture was taken and I was rewarded with a Dunkin' Donuts card which I thought was funny considering we work for Amazon. But it was nice to be acknowledged since there were so many people working there. if you are a good worker you can pretty much work where you want or were you are most efficient but also be prepare to be pulled away if they need you somewhere else. especially if you are considered one of the more efficient workers.","It can be a toxic environment. A lot of complaining about the work load mostly from the younger generation. "" F this place N word"" was their mantra, heard it every morning. I would tell them ""just think of it as you are getting paid to workout!"" Because they have a vending machine with gear in case you lose yours, people tend to abuse this and not keep tracked of their equipment. Parking lot would get littered with gloves and vests. If you were a fast and efficient worker they would move you around to pick up the slack of the slower employees. Some of these people were barely working making it frustrating for the people like myself who were scanning 3x the packages they were for the same pay. Management or the leaders they had on the floor were mostly young and were not trained to be leaders or have a proper work etiquette. We all have name tags and one of these young punks kept saying ""hey you, yeah you"" to me on several occasions when I advised him my name is on the tag and to address me properly and respectfully or don't address me at all. He no longer called on me from that time on, nor did he apologies. I was a warehouse manager for 8 years before working in IT and never treated my workers like they were cattle. Another big problem is some of these people were not even competent enough to scan the freight onto the pallet. Normally first box gets scanned to the pallet it goes to and after that you can scan freight to the box already on the pallet. This process was challenging for some and if you are working with this person then you usually get pulled aside with them even though you weren't at fault. I would now have not only scan my freight but rescan their freight in. I tried to explain this to leadership and advise who was the problem but, they rather pull a whole group aside instead of the the individual making the mistake. Bottom line when you scan something in right, it has a different tone beep and goes green showing it was scanned successfully and it does the opposite if you don't scan it in properly. This is not rocket science!!!",2.0
