1,"Really smart people, a lot of opportunity for growth, always encouraged to be innovative, think big, and create something new. Competitive salary and benefits with other major tech companies. 100% self motivating work environment. No dress code and 4 legged friends are welcome.","You have to be self motivated. NO ONE will hold your hand and tell you that you're doing a great job. If you need constant affirmations from management, this company isn't for you.",nil
2,"Jeff Bezos and his ""S-Team"" are brilliant and continue to make great decisions for long-term growth.  

You work with smart people, you work on exciting projects, you are pushed to your limits...which can be rewarding when you accomplish great things.  The diversity of the potential work and innovation can be very alluring.  I've often called Amazon my ""Sexy Mistress...she's emotionally abusive, but she's so sexy that I go back for more punishment.""","The management process is abusive, and I'm currently a manager.  I've seen too much ""behind the wall"" and hate how our individual performers can be treated.  You are forced to ride people and stack rank employees...I've been forced to give good employees bad overall ratings because of politics and stack ranking.",nil
3,"Amazon is doing lot's of cool stuff...but lots of boring stuff too.  There are really well run teams...and very badly run teams.  The experience for software managers and engineers is all over the board, from really run low operational load teams to teams where people burn out after a year.

 - Amazon is built, quite deliberately, to be Darwinian.  You can generally expect that anyone who's been here for more than 2 years is competent and motivated or they wouldn't have survived.  You can count on them as long as your priorities are aligned.  There aren't many slackers here, and they don't survive long.
  - We work on so much stuff that there's always an opportunity to find amazing cool stuff to work on (note that it's an 'opportunity', one that you have to pursue)
  - A chance to make a huge difference
  - A place where you can learn a lot about all kinds of things, both technical and about yourself
  - Amazon encourages high mobility - even your manager can't prevent you from moving to another team within 6 weeks (normally, more than a few months under unusual conditions).
  - Your friends and family have actually heard of the place you work and have at least a vague notion of what Amazon does without you having to explain","- You're responsible for your own career progression and finding the places and teams that are doing the stuff you want to do. No one is going to take you by the hand and help you with that.
- Amazon is built, quite deliberately, to be Darwinian. The strong survive and the weak perish (metaphorically speaking) and the 'bar' is constantly increasing. The level of performance that would have been acceptable five years ago will get you canned today.  It's a kind of crucible that'll help you develop a harder edge, if you can survive, that can serve you well in your career and in life, but it's often not a pleasant experience.

I wouldn't recommend it as a place to work for just anyone.",nil
4,"I've been at Amazon for a month now, and I've seen none of the horror stories being communicated to the public, although Amazon is a large enough company that I'm sure there are good pockets and bad pockets. Everyone here is really smart, and wants to succeed both personally, and as a company. People collaborate and help each other, focus on data, and truly focus on the customer. Every company I've ever worked for talks about how important the customer is, but on day 2, they're forgotten. Amazon seems to genuinely focus on what's best for the customer, and it's awesome to be in meetings where people actually bring that up, and make decisions focused on long-term customer satisfaction.

The opportunities to learn here are literally unlimited, and the opportunity to take on new responsibility is as well. I honestly believe you can be as awesome as you want here.","No cons, so far - seriously. Like I said, I'm sure Amazon has some bad pockets in it here and there, but this is an amazing job, an amazing opportunity, and the biggest thing I have to complain about is that it's a little chilly in our building. I can live with that.

Does Amazon demand high quality, measurable results? Yes! Is it hard work? Yes! Is it rewarding? Yes! So I'm not calling that a 'con'. Work/life balance seems comparable to other places I've worked - not worse.",nil
5,"- You can learn a lot very quickly in a very short time
- Surrounded with nothing but incredibly smart and driven individuals.
- Compensation is well beyond my expectations, and more than suitable.
- Exciting projects all across the company that keep you interested and focused.
- Amazon is changing the world","- Can be overwhelming, very steep learning curve
- Can be difficult to keep up if you are not self motivated",nil
6,This company gets A list performance from C list employees.  The culture is quick and hard charging.  You are always working in relevant and meaningful projects.,"Maybe because the company recruits C listers who have neither merit (intelligence, strategic vision) nor pedigree (academic or professional accomplishments), most of those who become successful do so in treacherous, low cunning ways.

Imagine the Lannisters in Game of Thrones attacking the Starks in Game of Thrones; or Rawls and Burrell attacking McNulty and Daniels in The Wire; or Barrow and O'Brien attacking Mr Bates in Downton Abbey.  This is every day leadership behavior at Amazon.  The culture at Amazon is so infested with these middling talent weasels who have juked the stats and schemed their way to positions of power that new employees coming in actually start thinking that this behavior is normal and expected if you want to ""manage people.""

The work itself was stimulating and fulfilling, but the sneering condescension of the d bags that cheated and skated their way through high school and party colleges, then just converted their winky nod nod good 'ol boy shenanigans into a ""ask no questions, have no introspection"" company culture have made manifest some of the worst criticisms of capitalism.  Any left leaning political aspirant would look at this business organism and immediately have content to lash out against the corruption that can come in free enterprise where hard work is not rewarded, and the connected, incestuous, privileged class lounge their way to wealth while treating their employees and customers like some kind of filth their shoe picked up on the street.",nil
7,"Challenging sometimes fun work environment
Being part of a team
Doing great things
Great people to work with","Organization and communication can be a challenge to maneuver around 
Hours can become a challenge when managing a hectic schedule 
Having to be available for any shift in order to move up in certain positions

8,"Disclaimer: My opinions reflect that of an SDE in Amazon. Seems like some operational job functions are very tough.

I have read through some of the other Amazon reviews and it seems to me that everyone has a very different experience! This is so true. Within the same team, you can have both workaholics and slackers coexisting and coworking together. I think I am more of the balanced type as I try to stay sane. The Amazon experience is basically the entire spectrum and it is what you make it out to be.

Pros in Amazon certainly excludes great benefits, but compensation is competitive. Free food means average quality free coffee, once in a while free pizza for lunch where it is a working lunch, and free beer and finger food in special events. We get a free Orca card to take any bus in the Seattle area for free. $160 per month subsidy for office parking, which is better than nothing. Downtown monthly parking goes for about $200 per month. 401K contribution is 50% of what you put in, where you can put in max 4% of your salary. Not so great. Staff cafeteria food is average and not at all cheaper than outside food, or could be even more expensive. It is hard not to complain about the cafeteria. Vacation days are ok but note that there are no sick leaves. They count as part of your 5 personal days per year. Listing the benefits of Amazon is like listing the cons and not the pros.

Work life balance seems to be ok for the most part, and seems to be individually-driven. No one will tell you that you have to come in at what time and stay till what time. I have team mates working every night and weekend, and others getting in at 10am and leaving at 5pm, all in the same team. Managers will focus on your project deliveries instead of how much time you spend working. If you work 40-hour weeks productively, you can definitely outperform someone who works 60-hour weeks but don't deliver stuff. Working less than 40 hours per week is somewhat common, but I can't say how many people are working how long. The view on work life balance is a bit skewed. All it comes down to are the managers and what they think. Projects are always never-ending but I have found that deadlines are very realistic and reasonable, without counting your nights and weekends. Getting some slack time once in a while is probably a sign of a healthy work environment. Everyone needs a break.

On-call really really sucks. Basically all it comes down to is having SDEs double-duty as support operations engineers. Note that on-call does not improve the code quality of any team in any way. The on-call experience is particularly bad because you are using services from some other team, and their code is of low quality and fails for the wrong reasons. If the managers had given more time to up the quality, there would not be so many problems. Software is usually delivered with a tough deadline with code that meets the minimum quality bar and never gets improved for the next few years. The code review process does not seem to help improve the code but it really obstructs developers from making great changes as unconventional things will not pass code review in clumsy minds. Innovation and excellence are not the name of the game in Amazon. Searching through the Amazon code base is usually not going to turn up quality code that you can actually reuse.

Integration is the name of the game in Amazon. You will need to spend a lot of time to figure out how to integrate your code with another team's services. Whether these other people are cooperative is a hit-or-miss. I have found that most people are responsive and helpful, but there are also quite a number of jerks who are out to make trouble for everybody. It is not easy to work across teams but the experience is mostly positive.

Amazon is a huge behemoth and is hiring people like there is no tomorrow. This reflects well on a good growth momentum but also is worrying that the company is not turning much profit. If the company does not make money, where is our bonus going to come from? You can see new faces around the Amazon building almost everyday! Downside is that we are taking in a lot of average to above-average engineers and being an Amazonian SDE certainly does not share the same reputation as the top names. Amazon is a huge mixed bag of some very talented people and some very dumb people. I think the world is not turning up enough SDEs and the only way is for quality to go downhill.

As an SDE, expect to spend most of your time talking, writing emails and documents, and maybe around 20-30% of your time coding. In most of the teams, you can work on interesting projects, but probably not revolutionary ones. Note that Amazon is a very down-to-earth company and the work is very down-to-earth as well. You will work on real things that people have actually requested for, and that people will start using as soon as you are done. Work is challenging but not to expect highly technically complex stuff. Most of the work has to do with solving everyday problems. To me, this seems to make sense because I have ever tried working on experimental projects before elsewhere and I did not feel it was a good use of my time.

Internal mobility is a key strength of Amazon, and I am not sure which company has done better than Amazon in this aspect. Internal moves are easy. You only need to stay in your team for a year before moving to a different team. There is no easy way to tell which team is a good team to move to because they all have their different pros and cons and people and coming and leaving all the time!

Seattle is by much rumour an easier place to live than the Bay area.

Overall Amazon is a tough but yet sane place to work. The flexibility of this company is really its core strength. You have the freedom to excel as much as you want and also to slack as much as you want. Bummer. You shouldn't be slacking!","Beware of bad managers and horrible team mates. They are not specific to Amazon but they do exist in Amazon.

I have to admit that Monday is usually a blue day at Amazon and it is very tough to look forward to getting into office. I don't know anyone in Amazon who looks forward to getting in on Mondays.

Be realistic about SDE requirements. Coding skills are good to have but they are not the most important part of your job. I think we are hearing the same thing from every company.

Medical coverage is average or below average. Expect to pay about $60 per month for singles and about $240 per month for families. $240 per month for families gives you $3000 in medical fees before you have to pay (more) anything out-of-pocket.

SDE advancement is unreal difficult. They have about 6 levels total, SDE 1-4, then Senior Principal Engineer, and finally Distinguished Engineer. The number of SDE 1s and 2s are huge. Trying to get to SDE 3 seems to be all-of-a-sudden extremely difficult, but not impossible. So this essentially means that if you come to Amazon as a fresh grad SDE, expect to get about only one or two promotions in your entire career, which obviously is quite a lame expectation and reality. You will probably do much better in your career advancement anywhere else.

Employee retention is horrible. I am not sure why the philosophy seems to be trying to undercut existing employees and then hire from external sources. Management all say that they are trying to retain people, but actions don't seem to suggest anything better. Rumour has it that annual pay raises are horrible. This basically mean that either you are a superstar in the company before they will try to retain you, or if you are smart you should not stay in Amazon for too long.",nil
9,"Great starting pay and the ability to get raises very quickly. Full training in all areas are offered and if your willing to work hard and sweat everyday for 10 hours a day, 4 days a week, then this is the job for you. The 4 day weeks go by quick, it can be exhausting so proper rest and a healthy lifestyle will help you stay strong within this company. Beat benefits as well once you are a hired on as a full time employee.","After 3 years of working with the company you ""cap out"" at $15.75, meaning you can no longer make any more money than that as a tier 1 associate. Your expected to want to move up in the company and that is the only way to make a better hourly wage, by advancing into management and operations management positions if there are any openings.",nil
10,"- super smart people, the best of the best from schools
- if you get hired here, you will be hirable anywhere, recruiting process is tough
- the pay is above average, probably 1.5 times elsewhere (but the expected results are 150% of elsewhere too)
- lots of opportunities to work on new, innovative projects
- cool SLU campus, lots of options for food and drinks after work","- frugality is taken to the extreme, only 2 weeks vacation, parking takes a year or more to get, zero perks (not even free Prime), no fitness allowance, poor 401k
- your peers will stab you in the back, your manager will blame you for their errors, you can't trust anyone
- people who throw others under the bus and take credit for other people's work get promoted
- expectations 60 -70 hours a week, some teams expect Sunday to be an ""in the office day"", headcount never gets filled, teams are always short a few people but the work keeps piling on.",nil
11,You honestly can't beat there pros They provide tuition after 90 Days PTO and VTO can be acquired after your first week. There dress codes is to dress comfortably. They have an easy to use A to Z app which is great. It still has issues and one is a major con from my experience.,"Cons For one you must stay working at all times and minimize bathroom trips. Best way to maintain your production and achieve the fastest time is by waiting till break and never stop stowing The biggest Con for me was during my time of employment I was dealing with depression and mental health problems due to losing one of the greatest friends/mentor, my sister who left behind a beautiful daughter. Sense this was the most traumatic thing that's could possibly happen I took a medical leave for a mental health program at Bradford. Well after completing the course I uploaded my documents to return to work. And the ERC Kept requesting more info and my doctor wouldn't allow it says that's all the information they need so after 4 months of being off the schedule I finally got erc to accept it but then my a to z app never put me back on the schedule. Which obviously has nothing to do with me but they insisted that I missed over 30 days of work and said I must either resign or get fired",nil
12,"Amazon offers some decent benefits. Continuing classes, medical, vacation time and different types of unpaid leave for life circumstances.",Bias- Harassment- Sexist- Mildly racist-,nil
13,"- Getting Amazon on your resume - You have thousands of reviews warning you NOT to take a job here, be better than me and listen to them - Pretty decent health care","- Horrible leadership - people are only promoted if they don't push back which leaves you with spineless management with no real opinions or thoughts of their own - Constant turnover (both people being fired and quitting) leads to work being dumped on those who remain. I have been here well under a year and seen over 7 people leave on an 18 person team (50/50 quitting and firing) - Peers are completely unwilling to help you - and they're proud of that. I was told by my manager to prep myself for being ""Wikislapped"" which means you ask someone for help and they respond with just a link. This might be helpful if the links weren't always outdated or filled with so much jargon and so little context that they're incomprehensible - They tell you that you have the ability to move teams however this isn't true. I have seen two instances of people being fired after expressing interest in another team. - Benefits are absolute trash. - They constantly lie to partners and force you to maintain those lies.",nil
14,"The pay is great, and every six months you get a raise. Even if they are small, it still is better than no raise at all. You can access benefits from day one, and they are VERY good benefits. The same kind of benefits you would see for military or government employees. You can also get access for funded schooling, up to $5,250 per academic year. I paid $176 for 4 classes. Amazon is a great steppingstone to further your education and career. Lastly, there is no interview process for working at Amazon. Lowkey you submit an application and get the job lol. You just have to take a drug test.","It is horrendously boring. Do not expect to have fun doing your job, but it is worth it in the end because you make great money. Be wary of cross training because once you do, they will force you to do it when they need help in that area. If you like what you were hired on for, I would stick with that. It is also very hard to get promoted from within. For some reason Amazon likes to hire managers that have never worked at Amazon and don't know how to do things they are supposed to be trained for.",nil
15,scale of business to handle and influence if you can write great tech strategy docs. good chance to grow if the charter is clear and team is tenured and if you have good PE support good pay,"your leaders play a great role in if you break or win. if they are weak, no matter how good you are you will fail. most of the leadership don't care in helping you with any challenges but you will be under the mercy of tenured SDEs in the team. SDEs can leave you overnight to other teams or give you bad feedback through connections surveys if you try to improve their performance. There is no bottom line from team unless they are awaiting a promotion, else they can just leave the team anytime you have a challenging situation.",nil
16,"- tons of smart people and knowledge to be shared with you - once you are in the flow of things, it's a relatively low stress easy to manage job most days - great internal tooling - fully remote and very clear lines in work-life balance (assuming Jassy doesn't take this away) - (maybe team/domain specific) very transparent leadership communication and operational goals - career growth has pretty tangible and transparent requirements to get to the next promotion, but only within the org and short term","- metrics are the only real way you are measured for performance despite not being always accurate representations of how much work you're doing, and this is by far my biggest gripe with this role. Ex. you could spend days on a case or resolve a case, but because the customer reopens a chat, and then you lose all credit for the time and effort you put in. - The pay is ok but obviously uncompetitive compared to other tech roles in AWS. This leads to everyone looking for other opportunities and a general loss of knowledge/skill as a team due to attrition",nil
17,"Guaranteed 40 hours per week 3 days off Wonderful benefits - medical, dental, vision, etc. Amazon pays for CDL school, free-of-charge, which costs $8,000 per student Great TEAM atmosphere, especially if you work with a super group of people! Lots of free food, clothes, swag & snacks :P","Only real con is having to do OTR - at least 3 days a week - driver fatigue :( Dangerous! There should be fair job rotation, so that everyone on the Tom Team has to obtain their CDL & drive, not just a few, whilst the others get to almost do nothing in the guard shacks.",nil
18,"The company culture prides itself on being peculiar. While in principle it does provide a good framework to innovate, the company really just cares about maximizing profits at any cost (including harm to its employees and the planet).","Amazon is an absolutely terrible company that will absolutely treat you as disposable no matter what your work ethic or contributions to the company. The benefits are the worst I've seen in the entire industry. No 401k matching for 3 years, bare minimum company holidays, disingenuous review practices. This place sucks. Full stop.

I moved through amazon's 'ranks' only to be paid peanuts compared to those hired during the covid boom. My RSUs were a good contributor to my TC but now with the stock at sub $97, I'm working at a loss.

20,1. Work on large projects 2. Flexible WFH and PTO policies 3. Decent pay 4. Great insurance,"1. Stakeholders are vampires, they suck your intelligence and use it to their own benefits, (example when they ask for directions and recommendations on a large project, and don’t involve you at all afterwards). 2. Many stakeholders think they know it all and can do anyone’s work (with questionable quality). Think about PM/TPMs doing work of data scientists/BIE or engineers doing creative work. This not only erodes trust, but creates terrible experiences for the customer. 3. Data is messy. Managers don’t know their numbers, and don’t verify them. 4. Managers creates their own data points to their own advantage, nothing else (request headcounts, make sure their goals are green). 5. Depending on the org you are there are no having formal processes, lots of agreements then ghosting, which means leaders changed their mind. 6. Not fast paced as others would think. 7.

24,"The medical/dental/vision benefits are adequate and the company does offer unpaid time, paid time off, and vacation from day one. They also offer the Career Choice program for associates to upskill and pursue other worthwhile opportunities.",The company indoctrinates you at every opportunity with their core values and then hides behind them without ever actually displaying any of them. There is zero real empathy for associates and nothing but constant placation. They tell they general public they favor Veterans and promote from within but the truth is the majority of all leadership are external hires with shiny new degrees and virtually little to no actual real-world or life experience. Insult to injury; YOU will be the ones responsible for training your leaders in their new roles while THEY reap a pay structure and compensation you'll never collect on. Even if you grow organically from within and are promoted to their rank you will NEVER bring home what they do with their overly generous compensation packages. If you display any modicum of competence they will trap you in your role and constantly over-leverage you knowing they can delegate everything they are either too lazy or inexperienced to complete themselves. The majority of them lack any time management or accountability whatsoever and promotions are largely based on politics and favoritism NOT your work-ethic and accolades. Any attempt to disagree and commit (a company leadership principle) will be met with hostility and their every effort to supplant you ensuring you never prosper within their organization. Be wary of all the empty promises they shower upon you as more often than not it is a ploy that will never see fruition despite your myriad efforts to go above and beyond their unrealistic expectations.,nil

27,"There are definitely more pros vs cons working at Amazon, working for the Ads organization, I can say some of them are: - Self-service culture for everything, allows you to dive deep as much as you need to learn and contribute - Processes even when seem to be totally established, the culture always allows you to build, challenge and improve, always documenting for the future. - Have the ability to collaborate with orgs that are not even part of your scope, it gives an open canvas to create valuable connections. - Remote flexibility, even when hybrid or fully, always makes the difference.","- Even when there is a lot of interaction and connections between orgs, these happens at an individual or small groups level, not necessarily driven by upper management - More organizational flexibility when it comes to PTOs",nil

Many stakeholders think they know it all and can do anyone’s work (with questionable quality). Think about PM/TPMs doing work of data scientists/BIE or engineers doing creative work. This not only erodes trust, but creates terrible experiences for the customer. 3. Data is messy. Managers don’t know their numbers, and don’t verify them. 4. Managers creates their own data points to their own advantage, nothing else (request headcounts, make sure their goals are green). 5. Depending on the org you are there are no having formal processes, lots of agreements then ghosting, which means leaders changed their mind. 6. Not fast paced as others would think. 7.

Insult to injury; YOU will be the ones responsible for training your leaders in their new roles while THEY reap a pay structure and compensation you'll never collect on. Even if you grow organically from within and are promoted to their rank you will NEVER bring home what they do with their overly generous compensation packages. If you display any modicum of competence they will trap you in your role and constantly over-leverage you knowing they can delegate everything they are either too lazy or inexperienced to complete themselves.

RSU grants don’t start to vest for 2 years. If you leave the company before then, for any reason whether voluntary or involuntary, they’re gone and go back into the company’s pocket.
Company assumes that RSUs will appreciate by 15% annually, and this assumption is used to justify granting fewer shares during compensation planning. When the stock fails to grow by 15% annually (including when it actually drops by 50%) the company will do absolutely nothing to even acknowledge the financial pain, let alone attempt to make you whole.
When stock is growing more than 15% annually, Amazon will deduct the excess growth from future RSU grants to ensure you don’t get paid “too much”. So much for rewarding high performance!

Add to that the opaque performance management process, the stack ranking (which they deny by hiding behind target percentages for various performance ratings) and the cut throat culture.

The ""vending machines"" supply pain medication instead of management addressing the root cause of the ""pain"" is not soreness, but rather the job being unsafe and causing lasting muscle and skeletal injuries. The facility is usually either too hot during summer months, or too cold during the winter months. There is rampant favoritism on who gets placed in various roles above the starting roles of pick, stow or pack. It is who you know, not necessarily what you know. There is a lack of meaningful communication between management and associates and the work has no sense of purpose. The associate is left to feel they are expendable. God help you if you become injured at work because Amazon makes it almost impossible to get any help from them. Instead, you are placed into a never ending process of ""request for accomodation"" instead of workers comp so Amazon can cover up workplace injuries in their facilities. The accomodation is then continuously denied by site management until the associate runs out of leave and is terminated, or you say you are able to return to work to full duty without accomodation.

Teams and individuals are encouraged to quickly adapt to changing priorities, which can be a pro for some but may not be suitable for everyone. The ""Correction of Errors"" process helps eliminate the blame game that often occurs during outages at other companies. Working in networking at Amazon offers unique and challenging problems that are difficult to find elsewhere. NDEs (network development engineers) are given the opportunity to work on the problems that interest them, even if it means switching teams. The company has high hiring standards, which means you'll be surrounded by bright and diverse individuals.","The constant change of priorities can have negative side-effects. Your project might have its scope altered or even cancelled altogether. The company's organizational structure has changed every 3 years or so, and there's often a trade-off between long-term personal development and short-term goals. If you're interested in pursuing non-Amazon technical development or certifications, be prepared to invest personal time and money. The combined effect of these factors has made my experience disappointing. I've reported to seven different managers in my time with the company, which has made it difficult to advance. However, experiences at Amazon vary widely depending on your team and focus, and some teams are better than others. I strongly recommend vetting your manager and team thoroughly before accepting a position.

There is a significant and noticeable difference between those that always do what's right, and those that just tell you what you want to hear. Most of the time, Ops will come around and make the necessary changes without putting up a fight. Know when to move on by transferring to another site. This is very site and Business Unit specific. The grass truly is greener at other sites.","When I started with Amazon, the principle ""You own your career"" was encouraging and motivating. Career opportunities are stunted by lack of shift rotation for proper exposure to the site leaders, and lack of experience level by managers that don't know how to recognize talent and Develop the Best. Req's are often filled before they are opened, and it has become about ""Who you know"" instead of what you have accomplished and what you have to contribute. This creates barriers for those that are ready to be promoted, relocating, looking to transfer, etc. Amazon needs to get back to the pre-Covid standards across the board. It's time for us to ""Return to Normal"" starting with the associate cell phones not being allowed on the FC floor.

Although some view it as onerous, I think the transparency and clearness will make promotions more equitable overall. - In general, very easy to reach out to and talk to people from other teams. Most people are happy to help out or share their thoughts if you are stuck on a problem. - Very few meetings (although I've heard this can vary with team).","- Some benefits are below FAANG pears (e.g. 401k match has max contribution of 4% of base pay) - If working fully remote, can be hard to meet and make connections with other employees unless you set aside the time to connect virtually or visit an office at some regular cadence. - Experience is very team-dependent (can be seen as pro or con I suppose, need to make sure you like your team and manager before joining).

Therefore, be careful about TIME WASTERS and things taking you away from your individual goals.

They have vending machines with gear like gloves and orange safety vests in case you lose yours. because I scanned over 350-450 packages my picture was taken and I was rewarded with a Dunkin' Donuts card which I thought was funny considering we work for Amazon. But it was nice to be acknowledged since there were so many people working there. if you are a good worker you can pretty much work where you want or were you are most efficient but also be prepare to be pulled away if they need you somewhere else. especially if you are considered one of the more efficient workers.","It can be a toxic environment. A lot of complaining about the work load mostly from the younger generation. "" F this place N word"" was their mantra, heard it every morning. I would tell them ""just think of it as you are getting paid to workout!"" Because they have a vending machine with gear in case you lose yours, people tend to abuse this and not keep tracked of their equipment. Parking lot would get littered with gloves and vests. If you were a fast and efficient worker they would move you around to pick up the slack of the slower employees. Some of these people were barely working making it frustrating for the people like myself who were scanning 3x the packages they were for the same pay. Management or the leaders they had on the floor were mostly young and were not trained to be leaders or have a proper work etiquette. We all have name tags and one of these young punks kept saying ""hey you, yeah you"" to me on several occasions when I advised him my name is on the tag and to address me properly and respectfully or don't address me at all. He no longer called on me from that time on, nor did he apologies. I was a warehouse manager for 8 years before working in IT and never treated my workers like they were cattle. Another big problem is some of these people were not even competent enough to scan the freight onto the pallet. Normally first box gets scanned to the pallet it goes to and after that you can scan freight to the box already on the pallet. This process was challenging for some and if you are working with this person then you usually get pulled aside with them even though you weren't at fault. I would now have not only scan my freight but rescan their freight in. I tried to explain this to leadership and advise who was the problem but, they rather pull a whole group aside instead of the the individual making the mistake. Bottom line when you scan something in right, it has a different tone beep and goes green showing it was scanned successfully and it does the opposite if you don't scan it in properly. This is not rocket science!!!",nil

Instead, you are placed into a never ending process of ""request for accomodation"" instead of workers comp so Amazon can cover up workplace injuries in their facilities. The accomodation is then continuously denied by site management until the associate runs out of leave and is terminated, or you say you are able to return to work to full duty without accomodation. This way Amazon avoids reporting injuries sustained by associates to OSHA and also avoids admitting there are systemic problems in their warehouses that are making the job unsafe.",nil

362,"Flexibility with taking time off and changing schedules, partial stock purchase plan and decent benefits.","This place has a huge turnover due to the fact that management treats employees like numbers. In the first year the facility was open it went thru a little over 4000 employees. Some don't even make it thru the first shift. The place is literally ran like a high school although some days it feels more like kindergarten due the childish behavior of some managers. We have been working an extra day of mandatory overtime since October of 2022 due to a shortage of staff. As soon as one batch is hired another batch leaves. Mandatory overtime is called MET and sometimes it gets added to your schedule at the last minute. If there is bad weather like the ice storm we had a few weeks ago they wont close the facility even though surrounding cities and schools shut down. They said they would excuse peoples time but after the fact refused to do so and, in some cases ask for pictures to prove you could not get out of your neighborhood. Pretty petty childish behavior of them to cheat people out of their time like that. There is a lot of favoritism, bullying and intimidation by the managers. The few good managers we have don't stay long or get moved to another area. In the first year my area went thru about a dozen managers and the longest one stayed was about 5 months. He was a pretty good guy but the constant stress of the place drove him back to the facility he came from in Memphis. Our department just acquired a problem manager that was passed over to us by another department. She has already ran off several good people in our area and about half of our department is now looking for a job or a transfer to another facility. No one in the area wants to pick up shifts on her end of the week and work with her. She has bullied several employees with health issues and put them in dangerous situations. Forcing employees to work in situations that are not ergonomic and could cause injury. Forcing employees to do very physical indirect task that they may not be physically able to do or desire to do and were not hired to do. Don't let her see you talking to someone or she will question you about your conversation. Upper management refuses to get rid of her and just lets it go on. It's really sad because it could be a great place to work. The facility has been open about a year and a half and most of the original employees are long gone. The few of us who remain most likely will not be there much longer at the rate it is going. There is just too many other good opportunities in the area that don't treat their employees like this company does.",nil

441,"Amazon has the absolute best Leadership Principles I have ever experienced. When they are followed, they produce the greatest results, and that is what makes Amazon so great. Amazon also has some of the most committed leaders I've ever had the pleasure of working with. There is a significant and noticeable difference between those that always do what's right, and those that just tell you what you want to hear. Most of the time, Ops will come around and make the necessary changes without putting up a fight. Know when to move on by transferring to another site. This is very site and Business Unit specific. The grass truly is greener at other sites.","When I started with Amazon, the principle ""You own your career"" was encouraging and motivating. Career opportunities are stunted by lack of shift rotation for proper exposure to the site leaders, and lack of experience level by managers that don't know how to recognize talent and Develop the Best. Req's are often filled before they are opened, and it has become about ""Who you know"" instead of what you have accomplished and what you have to contribute. This creates barriers for those that are ready to be promoted, relocating, looking to transfer, etc. Amazon needs to get back to the pre-Covid standards across the board. It's time for us to ""Return to Normal"" starting with the associate cell phones not being allowed on the FC floor. The increased number of rest periods is having an adverse effect and increasing rate of injury. Amazon has 20 years of operation prior to Covid and we need to use that data to drive the Safety Culture.",nil

Salary above the average.,"As business grow each year, the complexity of your day to day gets harder as in needing greater dive deeps into data to understand root cause of issues. And as is a high paced company, deadlines are real short to properly give an accurate answer.",nil
446,"Cheap health insurance, PTO, UPT and vacation time available for blue badge associates.",Long hours doing repetitive work. Lack of communication from Ops managers.,nil
447,full time work available and overtime,terrible work environment and managers,nil
448,Benefits are great but that is about it,Long Hrs if you are salary Only get paid once a month if you live in NC Poor Management that play favorites Only 40 hrs given for PTO and 30 for Vacation but you work 10hr days. You do the math Company treats you like a number more than a person Really have to kiss up to Management if you want a chance to move up in the company,nil
449,The people are amazing and you truly feel like you are part of a team. The resources seem endless and there is always someone that can help when you don't know how to do or find someone. I have never worked for a company that valued the customer experience more. It isn't easy to get here but it well worth the effort,There are almost too many resources and sources of information and it can be confusing to find what you are looking for.,nil
450,Flexibility with time off or picking up extra shift options No micromanagement. Great Insurance benefits Great pay for no stress job,Shift and Vacation freezes during Peak season with no heads up when it will be.

455,Awesome experience to be able to be apart of a huge diverse team,Lots of work hours to be an hr specialist,nil
456,Really no better place to be as a BIE. The amount and complexity of data will give you twice the experience you get anywhere else. The company also spends a great deal of effort ensuring your personal growth.,Projects are not simple and deadlines can be tight.,nil
457,Benefits were great everything was smooth!,"Work life balance was not great, long hours!",nil
458,"Growth and smart people, scale, pride","Long hours, intense , chaotic",nil
459,"I found the interview process to be incredibly informative and equitable. Interviewing at Amazon is rigorous but I felt like I had all the information I needed to prepare, and then I liked that it was up to me to put my all into that preparation. It felt great to have that culminate in an offer. Every interviewer I met was totally engaged, not distracted even though the chats were remote, and I felt like I was meeting people I could learn from and collaborate with. Now that I'm on the team, that feeling has been validated. Everyone I encounter goes the extra mile and is passionate about the shared Amazon culture and purpose.","I think Amazon onboarding at Amazon requires a real self-starter approach, that may not be what everyone is looking for as they jump into a new role. The self-serve culture requires tenacity and curiosity. For people looking for more guidance and context in a new role, Amazon may not be a fit. The sheer size and scale of the businesses are definitely an adjustment (even coming from other big tech players), and that too is a big adjustment.",nil
460,"Salary, learning, accelerated leadership, accelerated promotion schedules",WLB- still a probalem will always be. Talent- is not the same as it was before.,nil
461,Great company to work for,No cons as such. One of the best companies to work for,nil
462,"Work life balance, benefits, pay, and mostly low stress","A lot of rapid changes all of a sudden, constant reestablishing of trust between different business lines, can be extremely difficult to move up without bringing in your own individual skill sets developed elsewhere.",nil
463,"4 day work week, set schedule but ability to swap shifts easily, good management, great benefits.",It can be physically demanding. You are on your feet for 10 hours a day. Finding the right spot for you is important.,nil

469,-Great benefits PTO-UPT-Vacation time-Maternity leave - Good coworkers and very helpful when needed (technical or non technical) - Career opportunities - Management is good too. Not all managers are good but most of them are really good.,"-No office, have to sit in the Noisy area - Shift and not much of Flex.",nil
470,"1. Good benefits (health insurance, 401k, personal time off, vacation, and sick days). 2. A lot of good people working there (who deserve better pay & treatment).","1. Just recently got base pay raise. Normally they paid less than a lot of competitive companies for same position. Even w/ raise they pay less (w/ my two years experience) than competitive companies give at the start. 2. Physically overwhelming job. 3. A lot of drama in the leadership (favoritism, etc..) 4. Difficult to get promoted if you are not on someone's favorite list. 5. The more you do (top performer, trained for variety of different things in your department) - the less chances you will be promoted (managers don't want to loose their best hard workers to make them numbers & make them look good on their manager score (rates) board, so they can have their bonuses). And nobody pays you more for doing more.",nil
471,Growth and leadership skills fast moving,mixed wlb with politics and stress,nil
472,"To be fair there are some good people in the company, I have met all three of them. The work itself is not nearly that hard or important as they try to make you think during interviews. Unlimited coffee in the office, if your stomach is strong enough to handle it (mine was not). They bring lots of immigrants from all around the world to the United States, who would do anything for visa. If you have survived Amazon, you will probably survive war in Sudan, and any other work place will seem like a good vacation.","If you enjoy being in a jar with snakes, who wait for an opportunity to back stab, take credit for your work, or just emotionally abuse you and then lie about it, then this is the place for you. Another fun activity in most team is called on-call (my personal record of SEV2 per week was 52). Oh how many people left the company completely burnt out, some with depression, some with panic attacks, most with alcoholism. They say that the pay is above market average (maybe they mean Cambodian market, or some other third world countries). Most managers have no formal training in management, they just yesterday engineers, who spill all their frustration and poor management skills on you.",nil
473,"Clear goals, clear expectations, emphasis on communication and leadership principles. Everyone has awareness proper software engineering practices. Work with really sharp people","Be everything at all times and deliver everything fast. Responsibilities, particularly oncall, vary strongly between teams. Culture can be a bit cold.",nil

477,"The manager Mike C. in stow FHD is awesome! Couldn’t ask for a better manager than Mike ! He worked his way up the ladder, he understands how it is to start as a tier 1, makes you feel welcomed at Amazon no matter how long you’ve been with the company and I just hope he can excel to Operations soon ! Jax 7 located in Jacksonville, Florida would be nothing without him ! Awesome Team Leader !",People with lazy and bad work ethic gets promoted.,nil
478,Not bad of a job pretty basic tons of growth if you want it.,No secure placement couple months you are on day shift then next month on nights.,nil
479,"good infra, many talented colleagues","Bad benefits, salary not too much",nil
480,Amazon gives amble time to understand its peculiar culture and vast principles. The onboarding is well structured and very time bound. It helps to understand what to prioritize and grasp the content which would have been overwhelming otherwise. I really love the principles which can be applied both on and off work.,You are kind of on your own when the work starts but there is enough data to help you steer in the way of success.,nil

487,"Wonderful culture, true on boarding process, great people, support galore, second to no company regarding innovation, fair compensation, and all our behavior is driven by customer need. A true customer first company.","Amazon/AWS is a self service company for employees which means their are more than enough resources and internal sites to find everything you need or have a question about. The problem is, there is TOO much info and way to many sites. Would be nice if they could stream line the resources into something like an org chart to help people navigate all the amazing people and resources at our disposal.",nil
488,PTO and VTO was generous,Management micromanages and doesn’t know how to complete the jobs they make their associates do. HR is useless,nil
489,"For a company of this size, with so many engineers, we are given a great amount of freedom in our tools and processes. I'm also fortunate to have a manager with a great deal of experience. Although he expects high performance from us, he is also compassionate and understanding.","With the great level of freedom comes a great deal of complexity. The tools and processes help with managing the complexity, but only so much of it can be hidden. Perhaps this is how it is at all big tech FAANG companies. I wouldn't know since this is my first. I have only worked at smaller companies before this position.",nil
490,Flexible work schedule unlike no other job. The ability to take off whenever you choose with PTO (paid time off) or UPT (unpaid time off). Constant physical labor could be good for working out.,Constant physical labor could be strenuous on the body. Management are more bosses than leaders.,nil

Amazon ensures that my work environment is accessible for me to do my job.,I was not directly impacted by the layoffs and do worry about future layoffs if they do come.,nil
494,3 month onboarding process makes you feel equipped to understand amazon and your role. Well connected virtually and lots of recourse's to do your job.,Company is very complex and can be very overwhelming in the beginning.,nil
495,Good money with bonuses available,Slow at first then extremely fast paced,nil
496,Good time off with options,Bad management experience and hr doesn't know alot,nil
497,"Fun work environment, flexibility, pay.",Nothing that I can think of so far.,nil
498,"Lots of opportunities for advancement, solid pay","Constant culture of focusing just on what needs to be done to get promoted, not focusing on making the business better",nil
