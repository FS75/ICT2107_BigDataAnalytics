1,"It might be easy to roll your eyes when people from Facebook say how open their culture is, but it's true; it's more open than any other place I've worked at. At a company wide-level, secret projects, public incidents, important non-public business metrics and the like are all openly discussed. You can ask questions about them directly to Zuckerburg at the weekly Q&A. I think the idea is that if everyone is on the same page or at least, differing views are heard, the company will be stronger, and solutions may be offered from a place you didn't expect. This is much different from previous companies I worked at, where discussions on internal email lists would be shut down by some lawyer saying that there's certain things that can't be discussed, and important data is divided up to groups and individuals on a ""need to know"" basis, etc. 

This culture applies at a lower level too. You feel comfortable giving feedback to each other about each other, about product decisions, about management, etc. The flipside of this openness is that you of course, have to be willing to receive the feedback, you have to recognize that while openness and feedback is highly encouraged, decisions have to get made, and actions and data are more valuable than words. At the higher level, since the company trusts employees with access to so much information, keeping such info confidential from the outside world is taken seriously.

It's a great place to work as an engineer. You're given a lot of freedom, but it's also a responsibility to make sure you're doing things that are valuable. You don't get much credit for working hard or being smart if you don't produce valuable output.

One cool thing about Facebook, in contrast to other comparable companies (Google, Amazon, and Microsoft, though in truth, FB is much smaller), is how they have a pretty singular focus. Even with the differing areas (including advertising and such), they do a good job of keeping their eye on their mission of connecting as many people as possible. I also think they are way more empathetic to their users than most people give them credit for. It seems like popular opinion has it that FB is arrogant and only cares about its users insomuch as they represent $-signs. From within the company, it didn't feel this way at all. I saw a lot of empathy towards users, and a lot effort spent to improve or things or fix broken things with no direct financial benefit. The strategy is not complex. The thinking is that if they can make FB easier and more fun to use, then more people will use it for more time each day (which will also have a network effect of attracting even more people to use it), then the advertising dollars will follow. Of course, it is true that FB wants to make the audience more accessible to advertisers as well, but there are a lot of people at FB who care about privacy and security.

They have really good infrastructure and really great ways to share the infrastructure and code. They have a lot of cool internal tools, and what they've built is really impressive, and more importantly, it helps your team build products faster without having to solve problems that someone else already solved. Every software company tries to do this, but FB seems to have been more successful with it. Perhaps it's because they're still relatively small, but if anything, I can at least say it is very cool while it lasts.

The perks and work environment are great, unless you're one of those types that can't stand open office spaces. I've worked in both a private office and open offices in multiple companies. While I do think a private office has some benefits, I mostly think it's a personal luxury for the employee and a huge waste of money for the company. I'd much rather have the money go into other areas like salary, benefits, and other workplace improvements rather than the added real estate necessary to have offices.

Of course, you've heard about the food and snacks. They have an amazing selection of great stuff, and what I like about it is that it sort of goes above and beyond expectations. Sure, some days, lunch is better than others, but I really can't complain, and the selection of drinks and snacks is amazing. It's not like you should work at FB just because of that, but it demonstrates FB's desire to make work as fun and convenient as possible.

You'll be surrounded by people who like being there. I can't think of a better environment to work in. If you have a giant ego, you may not like it as much. Respect is definitely given to those that have deep experience in the industry, and they are expected to lead others and mentor more junior employees. However, if for whatever reason, you can't perform at the level expected, no one is going to care if you did this and that at Google or shipped ten things at MS, etc.

FB also has a lot of fun events, and I made a lot of friends working there, so going to the events was fun. Also, if you're older and worried that FB is just a bunch of 22-year-olds, and that you won't fit in, I wouldn't worry about that. FB does have a lot of young employees (who are really smart btw), and it does hire a lot of people straight out of college, but it also attracts a lot of experienced engineers from other top companies like Google, MS, Amazon, etc.

Work-life-balance seemed totally normal to me. It may be different depending on your team, but I felt you could do 40-50 hours of work a week for the most part and you would be totally fine. It's about what you produce, not how hard you're working. Other team members who had children would work normal hours and go home at normal times. I didn't see any of these folks have a problem when they left early to take care of their child or things like that. Of course, there could be times that people are expected to work extra if something critical happens, but for the most part everyone wants to avoid this and this happens sparingly, from what I observed. Now, there were many times where I chose to work late myself, but I never felt any pressure to do so. The caveat is that there are on-call rotations, and in addition, even if you are not on-call, you are expected to be reasonably available if the on-call person needs your help. However, again, no one wants this, and your team will work on ways to avoid these situations.

The best thing I can say is that working at FB is about productivity. I didn't experience and political bs and it was a pleasure working with a group of people who were all concerned with producing a good product and making the best of the time spent while doing it.","FB expects a lot out of engineers, and you can't slack off. Of course, you shouldn't slack off at any job, but since FB is pretty fast-paced, there is a risk that you'll have trouble adjusting at first.

FB has a lot of custom infrastructure and tools, and prehaps more impressively, it works great. It makes doing your job really great, but on the other hand, you'll end up learning a lot of stuff that won't be applicable elsewhere.

FB's code-base is very good in some ways, but in other ways, it's not as great as some of the existing engineers think it is. I don't think this is that big of a deal, but the important part is that as an engineer, you need to quickly learn FB's values and practices and ""get with the program"" so to speak. If you don't like some things, then you just have to deal with it, as it's not likely you're going to change people's minds at this point. The nice thing is that things are at least very consistent.",nil
2,"- Incredible benefits 
- Excellent compensation that rewards strong performance 
- Lots of autonomy 
- Tons of room for growth
- Very transparent from the top down
- Strong leadership
- Intelligent and caring colleagues
- The most fair and well thought out review process you will find everywhere 
- Exciting work","- If you don't learn to make the work life balance work for you, it can be exhausting. But you'll also be given lots of support with this if you ask for it. 
- It doesn't matter how good you are at your job, chances are you're going to be surrounded by a ton of other people who are just as good if not better. Imposter syndrome is real, but if you got an offer, you probably belong here too.",nil
3,"I'm a 55 year old working in a company where the average age is 28, and I've never been happier. I have always wanted to work in a company where I wasn't the proverbial square peg, and after nearly 30 years in the work force, I believe that I have found the company that complements my ideology for how a company should operate. Here are the ""Pros"" as I see them...

- Leadership:  Mark Zuckerberg, Sheryl Sandberg, Chris Cox and the rest of the leadership team. Inspiring, smart and totally real.
- The Culture:  The openness is a real thing, we're trusted to do the right thing, mistakes are expected, being yourself is important and encouraged, humility is encouraged and expected, building trust is paramount, the mission of making the world a more open and connected place isn't just a cool phrase because it guides everything. It's not about us, it's about everyone else.
- The People:  Smart and nice is what I find. The diversity is better than any other company I've worked at and it's getting better. Those that are figuring out how to make what we do better for everyone are really good at implementing their ideas. Two years ago I didn't know what this company really was or if it had a secure future. I can clearly see now that they have what it takes to last, and it's sincere.
- Management:  Managers are hired because they're good managers and not because they're good at something else. The management track is different than the contributor track and they're equal in importance.
- Benefits:  Working in the Valley it's hard to differentiate all the benefits employees receive and Facebook is at least equal to all the major tech companies, but coming from Seattle the benefits are nothing short of incredible.

Granted, I haven't been with the company for very long and I'm still in the honeymoon period, but I can tell what's real and what's not; this place is for real.","Like any tech company, the work is big and complicated so work/life balance can suffer from time to time. The difference is that it's the passion within the individuals that drives them to work long hours and forego time off. Of course there can be times when schedule demands force the imbalance, but it's not such that 10-12 hours days become commonplace and expected regardless. We do what we do to get the job done; no one is killing themselves because there's an order to do so.

Being able to eat to your hearts/stomachs content can be dangerous to the waistline, but that's a self-control thing and not the company's issue.",nil
4,"Facebook deeply cares about its employees and has built a compelling culture around support and growth. Career growth opportunities are plentiful. If you don't like the team you're on or don't get the support you want from your manger, Facebook empowers you to find new teams or projects. Facebook wants its employees to be invested in their work and to feel connected to its larger mission. If large scale opportunities and growth are important to you, Facebook is a fantastic place to work.",Facebook's culture is demanding and fast paced. The greatest aspect of working at Facebook is that everyone is very motivated and very smart. The problem with this is that they all expect the very same of you. Holding a very high bar for excellence can certainly be demanding so it's important to make sure you're always carefully paying attention to your own personal work/life balance.,nil
5,"Overall, love the people I work with, love Meta's dedication to DEI in all we do, and we have an interesting value proposition for the future.","Huge lack of planning org-wide. This leads to continous layoffs/uncertainty and lots of duplication of work/inefficient processes. Also still fighting a culture that has been bottom up for so long, which in terms of being impactful and getting things done that benefit the business, not just individuals, makes things difficult as a manager.",nil
6,Overall great place to work. They truly invest in their people. Had some of my best managers here. A lot of room to be an entrepreneur and feel a sense of ownership over your career.,"Before their layoffs, the company was also too fragmented in terms of roles and responsibilities. It made it difficult to find your place and feel like you offer value. Company also changed priorities a lot which became discouraging after awhile because it was difficult to feel like you could accomplish anything.",nil
7,"You get what you expect - Really great benefits like one of the best healthcare I've seen in the US corporate world, stipends, great 401k match, great in office amenities, supportive ERGs, pretty good work-life balance, the brand name on resume (that may no longer be so relevant in 2023). All the people you work with are incredibly talented and smart. Super inclusive and diversity minded - everyone is open minded and respectful. Career opportunities are abound (lateral transfers and team changes) but you will have to be very sharp, politically savvy, and patient for a promotion. 3+ years wait for a promotion is not uncommon. If you came from start up environment this would be very difficult. Most of very smart ICs with leadership aspiration leave because they don't see themselves climbing or losing their life to compete in the pool. Good thing is I've seen everyone move on to higher paying jobs at arguably more fun companies after 2 years or so if you are fine with job hopping then this should be good!","Same.. You get what you expect from a huge company with lots of 'scandals' ; always being in news for negative headlines and layoffs impact employee morale. Constant org changes and bureaucratic processes impact how fast you can get work done even though you are constantly told to move fast. Getting a tiny change out takes weeks, and because it's tiny even though it can lead to great improvement long-term, it gets deprioritized and every resource gets put in bigger, higher impact projects. So you are building sophisticated castle on shaky sandy foundation, until things break!",nil
8,Benefits are great although they may go down now that they are tightening their belt. Great comp although with stock price decline may not be any more. Opportunity to work on large scale products.,"For senior folks it's hard to find projects with good scope. The company had layoffs, even for people left behind the morale is down and indications are more people will either be managed out or leave on their down. Meta is not growing but is shrinking. They still suffer significantly from being short term impact driven in PSC process, they've been trying to change this for years, even removed the Move Fast / Break Things and replaced with Long term. Problem is most of the folks in calibration and running the show still have short term impact in their DNA as they way they measure everything. Mark is very fixated on the meta-verse as a bet the company initiative. Problem is that he is spending soo much on it and the likely timeframe when it goes mainstream is still years out. Also the ads business is in trouble with the economy in decline and head winds from apples privacy changes, they basically need to rewrite the ads stack which will take a long time and revenue will suffer in the mean time.",nil

49,"I just left Google and joined Facebook, and felt so much happier. The reasons are:

1. The real impact
At Google I joined a team whose product is only used by less than 1000 people, and even for that product I was assigned to do a peripheral part, whose functionality actually doesn't matter at all. Just for that module, I had to write unit test for every silly part of the code, and took long iteration cycles. I admit those are good engineering coding trainings, however taking precious time in my life to work on something that doesn't matter is just a waste of my life.

In Facebook things just move so much faster. There are standard software engineering review process but not as rigid. Just during training (boot camp) weeks, I had tasks to change very important part of Facebook's core code, and the second day after I check-in my code, it got shipped to almost 1 billion people. As a software engineer I cannot recall a moment I felt better for my job.

Then I joined a team that's extremely important to Facebook's revenue. A mistake in the code I changed could cause Facebook million dollar a day. However Facebook just trusted us, allowed us making mistake and having quick iteration cycles to test ideas fast. If I make a coding mistake in my team in Google it might cost Google nothing in terms of revenue as my product was small, however the development process was so strict I could not have chance to try my innovations or test my ideas. But in Facebook that's all possible.

2. The organizational structure
Google's organization is now very structured and hierarchical. Facebook is having more layers, but the working style is still flat, and social-network style. Speaking to people in different teams, form an idea, lead a virtual team and complete it, this style is still valued. My boss is more like a mentor helping me navigating through the ideas, rather than an authority telling me what to do.","1. I don't quite like the office decoration style.

 - Amazon is built, quite deliberately, to be Darwinian.  You can generally expect that anyone who's been here for more than 2 years is competent and motivated or they wouldn't have survived.  You can count on them as long as your priorities are aligned.  There aren't many slackers here, and they don't survive long.
  - We work on so much stuff that there's always an opportunity to find amazing cool stuff to work on (note that it's an 'opportunity', one that you have to pursue)
  - A chance to make a huge difference
  - A place where you can learn a lot about all kinds of things, both technical and about yourself
  - Amazon encourages high mobility - even your manager can't prevent you from moving to another team within 6 weeks (normally, more than a few months under unusual conditions).
  - Your friends and family have actually heard of the place you work and have at least a vague notion of what Amazon does without you having to explain","- You're responsible for your own career progression and finding the places and teams that are doing the stuff you want to do. No one is going to take you by the hand and help you with that.
- Amazon is built, quite deliberately, to be Darwinian. The strong survive and the weak perish (metaphorically speaking) and the 'bar' is constantly increasing. The level of performance that would have been acceptable five years ago will get you canned today.  It's a kind of crucible that'll help you develop a harder edge, if you can survive, that can serve you well in your career and in life, but it's often not a pleasant experience.

I wouldn't recommend it as a place to work for just anyone.",nil
494,"I've been at Amazon for a month now, and I've seen none of the horror stories being communicated to the public, although Amazon is a large enough company that I'm sure there are good pockets and bad pockets. Everyone here is really smart, and wants to succeed both personally, and as a company. People collaborate and help each other, focus on data, and truly focus on the customer. Every company I've ever worked for talks about how important the customer is, but on day 2, they're forgotten. Amazon seems to genuinely focus on what's best for the customer, and it's awesome to be in meetings where people actually bring that up, and make decisions focused on long-term customer satisfaction.

The opportunities to learn here are literally unlimited, and the opportunity to take on new responsibility is as well. I honestly believe you can be as awesome as you want here.","No cons, so far - seriously. Like I said, I'm sure Amazon has some bad pockets in it here and there, but this is an amazing job, an amazing opportunity, and the biggest thing I have to complain about is that it's a little chilly in our building. I can live with that.

Does Amazon demand high quality, measurable results? Yes! Is it hard work? Yes! Is it rewarding? Yes! So I'm not calling that a 'con'. Work/life balance seems comparable to other places I've worked - not worse.",nil

496,This company gets A list performance from C list employees.  The culture is quick and hard charging.  You are always working in relevant and meaningful projects.,"Maybe because the company recruits C listers who have neither merit (intelligence, strategic vision) nor pedigree (academic or professional accomplishments), most of those who become successful do so in treacherous, low cunning ways.

Imagine the Lannisters in Game of Thrones attacking the Starks in Game of Thrones; or Rawls and Burrell attacking McNulty and Daniels in The Wire; or Barrow and O'Brien attacking Mr Bates in Downton Abbey.  This is every day leadership behavior at Amazon.  The culture at Amazon is so infested with these middling talent weasels who have juked the stats and schemed their way to positions of power that new employees coming in actually start thinking that this behavior is normal and expected if you want to ""manage people.""

The work itself was stimulating and fulfilling, but the sneering condescension of the d bags that cheated and skated their way through high school and party colleges, then just converted their winky nod nod good 'ol boy shenanigans into a ""ask no questions, have no introspection"" company culture have made manifest some of the worst criticisms of capitalism.  Any left leaning political aspirant would look at this business organism and immediately have content to lash out against the corruption that can come in free enterprise where hard work is not rewarded, and the connected, incestuous, privileged class lounge their way to wealth while treating their employees and customers like some kind of filth their shoe picked up on the street.",nil

498,"Disclaimer: My opinions reflect that of an SDE in Amazon. Seems like some operational job functions are very tough.

I have read through some of the other Amazon reviews and it seems to me that everyone has a very different experience! This is so true. Within the same team, you can have both workaholics and slackers coexisting and coworking together. I think I am more of the balanced type as I try to stay sane. The Amazon experience is basically the entire spectrum and it is what you make it out to be.

Pros in Amazon certainly excludes great benefits, but compensation is competitive. Free food means average quality free coffee, once in a while free pizza for lunch where it is a working lunch, and free beer and finger food in special events. We get a free Orca card to take any bus in the Seattle area for free. $160 per month subsidy for office parking, which is better than nothing. Downtown monthly parking goes for about $200 per month. 401K contribution is 50% of what you put in, where you can put in max 4% of your salary. Not so great. Staff cafeteria food is average and not at all cheaper than outside food, or could be even more expensive. It is hard not to complain about the cafeteria. Vacation days are ok but note that there are no sick leaves. They count as part of your 5 personal days per year. Listing the benefits of Amazon is like listing the cons and not the pros.

Work life balance seems to be ok for the most part, and seems to be individually-driven. No one will tell you that you have to come in at what time and stay till what time. I have team mates working every night and weekend, and others getting in at 10am and leaving at 5pm, all in the same team. Managers will focus on your project deliveries instead of how much time you spend working. If you work 40-hour weeks productively, you can definitely outperform someone who works 60-hour weeks but don't deliver stuff. Working less than 40 hours per week is somewhat common, but I can't say how many people are working how long. The view on work life balance is a bit skewed. All it comes down to are the managers and what they think. Projects are always never-ending but I have found that deadlines are very realistic and reasonable, without counting your nights and weekends. Getting some slack time once in a while is probably a sign of a healthy work environment. Everyone needs a break.

On-call really really sucks. Basically all it comes down to is having SDEs double-duty as support operations engineers. Note that on-call does not improve the code quality of any team in any way. The on-call experience is particularly bad because you are using services from some other team, and their code is of low quality and fails for the wrong reasons. If the managers had given more time to up the quality, there would not be so many problems. Software is usually delivered with a tough deadline with code that meets the minimum quality bar and never gets improved for the next few years. The code review process does not seem to help improve the code but it really obstructs developers from making great changes as unconventional things will not pass code review in clumsy minds. Innovation and excellence are not the name of the game in Amazon. Searching through the Amazon code base is usually not going to turn up quality code that you can actually reuse.

Integration is the name of the game in Amazon. You will need to spend a lot of time to figure out how to integrate your code with another team's services. Whether these other people are cooperative is a hit-or-miss. I have found that most people are responsive and helpful, but there are also quite a number of jerks who are out to make trouble for everybody. It is not easy to work across teams but the experience is mostly positive.

Amazon is a huge behemoth and is hiring people like there is no tomorrow. This reflects well on a good growth momentum but also is worrying that the company is not turning much profit. If the company does not make money, where is our bonus going to come from? You can see new faces around the Amazon building almost everyday! Downside is that we are taking in a lot of average to above-average engineers and being an Amazonian SDE certainly does not share the same reputation as the top names. Amazon is a huge mixed bag of some very talented people and some very dumb people. I think the world is not turning up enough SDEs and the only way is for quality to go downhill.

As an SDE, expect to spend most of your time talking, writing emails and documents, and maybe around 20-30% of your time coding. In most of the teams, you can work on interesting projects, but probably not revolutionary ones. Note that Amazon is a very down-to-earth company and the work is very down-to-earth as well. You will work on real things that people have actually requested for, and that people will start using as soon as you are done. Work is challenging but not to expect highly technically complex stuff. Most of the work has to do with solving everyday problems. To me, this seems to make sense because I have ever tried working on experimental projects before elsewhere and I did not feel it was a good use of my time.

Internal mobility is a key strength of Amazon, and I am not sure which company has done better than Amazon in this aspect. Internal moves are easy. You only need to stay in your team for a year before moving to a different team. There is no easy way to tell which team is a good team to move to because they all have their different pros and cons and people and coming and leaving all the time!

Seattle is by much rumour an easier place to live than the Bay area.

Overall Amazon is a tough but yet sane place to work. The flexibility of this company is really its core strength. You have the freedom to excel as much as you want and also to slack as much as you want. Bummer. You shouldn't be slacking!","Beware of bad managers and horrible team mates. They are not specific to Amazon but they do exist in Amazon.

I have to admit that Monday is usually a blue day at Amazon and it is very tough to look forward to getting into office. I don't know anyone in Amazon who looks forward to getting in on Mondays.

Be realistic about SDE requirements. Coding skills are good to have but they are not the most important part of your job. I think we are hearing the same thing from every company.

Medical coverage is average or below average. Expect to pay about $60 per month for singles and about $240 per month for families. $240 per month for families gives you $3000 in medical fees before you have to pay (more) anything out-of-pocket.

SDE advancement is unreal difficult. They have about 6 levels total, SDE 1-4, then Senior Principal Engineer, and finally Distinguished Engineer. The number of SDE 1s and 2s are huge. Trying to get to SDE 3 seems to be all-of-a-sudden extremely difficult, but not impossible. So this essentially means that if you come to Amazon as a fresh grad SDE, expect to get about only one or two promotions in your entire career, which obviously is quite a lame expectation and reality. You will probably do much better in your career advancement anywhere else.

Employee retention is horrible. I am not sure why the philosophy seems to be trying to undercut existing employees and then hire from external sources. Management all say that they are trying to retain people, but actions don't seem to suggest anything better. Rumour has it that annual pay raises are horrible. This basically mean that either you are a superstar in the company before they will try to retain you, or if you are smart you should not stay in Amazon for too long.",nil
499,"Great starting pay and the ability to get raises very quickly. Full training in all areas are offered and if your willing to work hard and sweat everyday for 10 hours a day, 4 days a week, then this is the job for you.

Beat benefits as well once you are a hired on as a full time employee.","After 3 years of working with the company you ""cap out"" at $15.75, meaning you can no longer make any more money than that as a tier 1 associate.

Best way to maintain your production and achieve the fastest time is by waiting till break and never stop stowing The biggest Con for me was during my time of employment I was dealing with depression and mental health problems due to losing one of the greatest friends/mentor, my sister who left behind a beautiful daughter. Sense this was the most traumatic thing that's could possibly happen I took a medical leave for a mental health program at Bradford. Well after completing the course I uploaded my documents to return to work. And the ERC Kept requesting more info and my doctor wouldn't allow it says that's all the information they need so after 4 months of being off the schedule I finally got erc to accept it but then my a to z app never put me back on the schedule. Which obviously has nothing to do with me but they insisted that I missed over 30 days of work and said I must either resign or get fired",nil
502,"The pay is great, and every six months you get a raise. Even if they are small, it still is better than no raise at all. You can access benefits from day one, and they are VERY good benefits.

They also offer the Career Choice program for associates to upskill and pursue other worthwhile opportunities.",The company indoctrinates you at every opportunity with their core values and then hides behind them without ever actually displaying any of them. There is zero real empathy for associates and nothing but constant placation. They tell they general public they favor Veterans and promote from within but the truth is the majority of all leadership are external hires with shiny new degrees and virtually little to no actual real-world or life experience. Insult to injury; YOU will be the ones responsible for training your leaders in their new roles while THEY reap a pay structure and compensation you'll never collect on. Even if you grow organically from within and are promoted to their rank you will NEVER bring home what they do with their overly generous compensation packages. If you display any modicum of competence they will trap you in your role and constantly over-leverage you knowing they can delegate everything they are either too lazy or inexperienced to complete themselves. The majority of them lack any time management or accountability whatsoever and promotions are largely based on politics and favoritism NOT your work-ethic and accolades. Any attempt to disagree and commit (a company leadership principle) will be met with hostility and their every effort to supplant you ensuring you never prosper within their organization. Be wary of all the empty promises they shower upon you as more often than not it is a ploy that will never see fruition despite your myriad efforts to go above and beyond their unrealistic expectations.,nil

You could be done in 5 or you are working 10-12 hours.

Peers I have met bring different experiences to the table.

This can be unfortunate and challenging if you are use to getting promoted based on time. This isn't true for AWS. To be honest, it isn't that way at any startup or software company. The other con is that the onboarding is geared for the lowest level, so if you come with deep experience in cloud and tech, it can be a chore as it feels like review addition and subtraction.

I wanted to quit after my 2nd month there. No one cares about you, from the day 1 it's sink or swim, no one will train you, you have to figure things out on your own, and if you make a mistake, it's all over for you. Super high turnover, in 6months I was on my 2nd manager, 3rd director, most of my teammates are new, less than a year, and already miserable. All of the rumors you read/hear are true in my experience. Maybe I just had bad luck and landed on the wrong team, but I doubt it. Amazon pays you a sign on bonus in a lump sum in year 1 as an incentive not to quit within your first 12 months as an attempt to lower turnover rate If you resign you'll have to pay it back prorated, so if you join, demand that your sign on bonus is paid monthly.

A lot of complaining about the work load mostly from the younger generation. "" F this place N word"" was their mantra, heard it every morning. I would tell them ""just think of it as you are getting paid to workout!"" Because they have a vending machine with gear in case you lose yours, people tend to abuse this and not keep tracked of their equipment. Parking lot would get littered with gloves and vests. If you were a fast and efficient worker they would move you around to pick up the slack of the slower employees. Some of these people were barely working making it frustrating for the people like myself who were scanning 3x the packages they were for the same pay. Management or the leaders they had on the floor were mostly young and were not trained to be leaders or have a proper work etiquette. We all have name tags and one of these young punks kept saying ""hey you, yeah you"" to me on several occasions when I advised him my name is on the tag and to address me properly and respectfully or don't address me at all. He no longer called on me from that time on, nor did he apologies. I was a warehouse manager for 8 years before working in IT and never treated my workers like they were cattle. Another big problem is some of these people were not even competent enough to scan the freight onto the pallet. Normally first box gets scanned to the pallet it goes to and after that you can scan freight to the box already on the pallet. This process was challenging for some and if you are working with this person then you usually get pulled aside with them even though you weren't at fault. I would now have not only scan my freight but rescan their freight in. I tried to explain this to leadership and advise who was the problem but, they rather pull a whole group aside instead of the the individual making the mistake. Bottom line when you scan something in right, it has a different tone beep and goes green showing it was scanned successfully and it does the opposite if you don't scan it in properly.

At times Amazon can feel like a huge Adult Highschool. We have high standards on hiring external talents, but will promote anyone internally to the same position (AMs) with no experience. Too many internal politics inside the FC. Lack of diversity in high roles this includes women and POC. At times it’s like real talent is not valued. Amazon will promote anyone in any role just based off seniority and not talent. You really don’t need a degree to do this job. All you need is really good people skills.

I can tell you that if you are hired as an L4 Manager an make it 1 year promotion L5 role is a given performance really don’t matter. Most managers are L5 and everybody want’s to be an L6 yet lack experience to do the role.

Base salary accounts for less than half of “target” compensation.
RSU grants don’t start to vest for 2 years. If you leave the company before then, for any reason whether voluntary or involuntary, they’re gone and go back into the company’s pocket.
Company assumes that RSUs will appreciate by 15% annually, and this assumption is used to justify granting fewer shares during compensation planning. When the stock fails to grow by 15% annually (including when it actually drops by 50%) the company will do absolutely nothing to even acknowledge the financial pain, let alone attempt to make you whole.
When stock is growing more than 15% annually, Amazon will deduct the excess growth from future RSU grants to ensure you don’t get paid “too much”. So much for rewarding high performance!

Add to that the opaque performance management process, the stack ranking (which they deny by hiding behind target percentages for various performance ratings) and the cut throat culture.

Very fast paced and you are always working (even on vacation you have to be available).,nil
613,"Career opportunities are amazing. This a fast paced business, you are NOT going to be looking at your watch all day. There is a diverse workforce in all aspects. You will mostly do work with challenge. World class benefits.","Work life balance can be an issue. Hasn't been yet for me, but can be. Training up front (online courses) are too heavy in the culture and not your actual job role. Must be a fast learner- most of my job primary job functions I've learned because someone told me; there were no guides or notes. They used to exist, but seems they are all two years or more old. Job is not as physically demanding as I thought, but I have gone 10-11 hours without sitting down. As other reviews have stated- this is not a job where someone is likely to come to you and tell you what a great job you are doing. If you are self motivated, you can not only do well at your site, but you likely are going to start networking to move onward in a career path that you can excel in. That job will be all on YOU.",nil

Promotions seem to come slower than promised. You get threatened with being fired if you don't address your Ops managers fast enough. And the open door policies that Amazon claims to uphold get swept under the rug because the Ops managers and HR have some type of hierarchy over everyone else. And if you aren't in the group then you are looked down upon and treated as a lower class citizen to Amazon.",nil

Great job for gaining experience that looks attractive on applications.",Sometimes your metrics may be negatively affected by factors outside of your control (such as your customers not liking a policy change that was made at a corporate level.) and this will reflect poorly on you.

624,"Love the team I work with! Everyone is super nice and very available to help with any questions I might have. They really make sure to set you up for success by giving you several weeks to work your way through the training materials, and start you off slowly with positions. One of the reasons I left my previous employer was there were zero growth opportunities. At Amazon, it feels limitless. There are so many teams and chances to grow that it is really exciting to think about where your career can go. I don't feel pigeon holed, and I'm really excited to see where I can go here.","Although I wrote about the training materials in the Pros section, it can also be seen as a Con just by the sheer amount of information there is. There is so much that it becomes a project all by itself to make sure you are staying organized and can find the information later (I wish I would have started a digital notebook earlier on to help organize everything). There has also been so much change that it has been a little difficult to really get into a rhythm. My manager left to another team two weeks in, we merged with another organization 1 month in, and I switched the tech teams I was supporting twice.

A typical night is 12+ hours because of all the meetings and activities they have managers participate in both before and after the associates' shift ends. If you plan on joining Amazon and moving around frequently; don't do it. I had hopes of that, and was even told by several people in the recruiting process that it was pretty much the norm. Shortly after I came on-board, they released a policy that restricts managers from moving until they have been in the same role and at the same site for a year. I never would have accepted the offer if I knew that was coming. They refused to grandfather managers who were already hired before the policy came out.",nil
627,"- If you have a good manager, Amazon can be a great experience. The times I had good managers, I was able to do great work and get the resources I needed. - Lots of resources for training, skill improvement, etc. - A very robust remote work system - obviously of only limited usefulness because they want people in the office three days a week, but on days when you do work outside your office, the system works incredibly well. It's even good enough that you can register your own laptop as an Amazon laptop and get it wiped when you're done. - The on-call process is surprisingly pleasant. Each team member takes a 1-week turn with on-call, and if your code is built so that breaking changes are difficult to get into prod (which most of them are), you will very rarely be paged after hours, if at all.","- If you _don't_ have a good manager (perhaps because they don't get you, don't respect your time, can't stand up to demanding PMs) then you will have an awful experience. And unfortunately, Amazon has enough internal reorgs that you really don't have control of who your manager is. - I couldn't help but feel like I was in a cult the whole time. The ""leadership principles"" feel like dogmatic recitations, they always insisted that you were the best due to their rigorous interview process (which honestly didn't feel nearly rigorous enough after seeing it from the inside), and it was nearly impossible to have any insight into what upper management thought, especially when it came to salary and performance reviews. - Lots of theater for code changes, especially new deployments. Deploying a new microservice is very involved (as it should be), but Amazon likes to use microservices for everything. Amazon also uses a bloated OOP model for most services.",nil

Hasn't bothered me so far but if that's not your thing then it's not for you. Pro's stated, that only applies to Amazon Air, NOT AMAZON. The thing about Amazon Air is that there are generally excess staff to what is actually required on the Ramp(where planes are serviced), this goes doubly for peak seasons, so everyday a certain number of people are sent to the Amazon warehouse where the containers Amazon Air employees load onto planes are packed and unpacked. The environment here is not great to be honest, from what I've heard it's much better than standard Amazon facilities, but still not great. There are next to no windows, the majority of people don't talk to each other, and the pace of work is consistently inconsistent. Basically a lot of standing around occasionally grabbing boxes off a belt, sometimes it's faster paced, sometimes slower. I find this kind of work tedious and mind numbing, maybe you won't. But if you're someone who likes to keep busy, or someone who likes to just relax, I doubt doubt warehouse work will appeal to either. Management is ok to poor here, you are treated as a drone by most managers, but some are cool.

I developed carpal tunnel syndrome working for Amazon which made it painful to work. They denied accommodations and required me to write down (re writing the same answer 3 different ways) until it sounded like I had injured myself elsewhere “in my own words.” They changed the time-off policies with no notice which caused and unprecedented drop in hours for me and then would not approve my medical leave for seeing a doctor trying to get accommodations. This caused me to go negative in hours and I received emails saying they would fire me soon. I pleaded with HR, who are two uneducated women who do not care about the employees and will make no attempt to help. All of my superiors knew it caused me pain to work and I was told “No” personally when asking for them to please help me by every level of superior I was able to talk to. I can’t use my right arm hardly at all now and I still can’t get a job. They made sure I swore it wasn’t them after I told them it was and then said they’d fire me and would not offer accommodations. ON TOP OF THIS, my login was immediately invalidated when I resigned, so I don’t have access to my W2. That’s right, they won’t even send me a physically copy and are denying access to the digital one because guess what? It’s not their problem. I’ve already contacted the same HR team I was looking forward to never having to talk to again and do no expect to hear back. This was my third Amazon location and they just keep getting worse.

AWS really gives you the time you need to learn about the company and how to be successful at your job. There are a lot of valuable skills you can develop due to the wide array of services AWS offers. The promotional track is also among the best I've seen. Promotions are objective and based almost solely on your work performance. You can grow within AWS or you market the skills in the open market.,"AWS is its own universe of services and technologies apart from any other organization you may have experience with in the past. Upon hire you may not be placed where your skills and experience align best. You are placed where there is company need.

There is no room for complacency and the rate of growth is astonishing. The leadership principles are not just a corporate statement, they really are the norm here. And they make you feel very empowered once you internalize them. If you are looking for professional growth and endless opportunities, this company is miles ahead than others I've known. Most importantly, you are compensated for what you do in a very data-driven way, there is no convoluted paths for promotion and the culture is almost of an almost utopian meritocracy.","Not a con per se, but I have known many people who are just looking for a 9-17 job, same same every day, a comfortable safe position in a giant company. This is not what Amazon is about. We want you to grow from day one. The company has a place for people of all walks of life, but you have to be ambitious, driven and willing to put the effort. Sometimes it is hard to be motivated by a greater purpose of the company. I would say that the best outcomes of Amazon to the world are by-products of its core services (setting a legitimate customer-oriented standard for corporations, promoting an engaging and inclusive work environment, enabling people to do more dignified jobs by automating trivial work, optimizing logistics and distribution of goods with technology, etc...). In my position there is a lot of business travels, so make sure to align the expectations with your family and yourself.",nil

But it was nice to be acknowledged since there were so many people working there. if you are a good worker you can pretty much work where you want or were you are most efficient but also be prepare to be pulled away if they need you somewhere else. especially if you are considered one of the more efficient workers.","It can be a toxic environment. A lot of complaining about the work load mostly from the younger generation. "" F this place N word"" was their mantra, heard it every morning. I would tell them ""just think of it as you are getting paid to workout!"" Because they have a vending machine with gear in case you lose yours, people tend to abuse this and not keep tracked of their equipment. Parking lot would get littered with gloves and vests. If you were a fast and efficient worker they would move you around to pick up the slack of the slower employees. Some of these people were barely working making it frustrating for the people like myself who were scanning 3x the packages they were for the same pay. Management or the leaders they had on the floor were mostly young and were not trained to be leaders or have a proper work etiquette. We all have name tags and one of these young punks kept saying ""hey you, yeah you"" to me on several occasions when I advised him my name is on the tag and to address me properly and respectfully or don't address me at all. He no longer called on me from that time on, nor did he apologies. I was a warehouse manager for 8 years before working in IT and never treated my workers like they were cattle. Another big problem is some of these people were not even competent enough to scan the freight onto the pallet. Normally first box gets scanned to the pallet it goes to and after that you can scan freight to the box already on the pallet. This process was challenging for some and if you are working with this person then you usually get pulled aside with them even though you weren't at fault. I would now have not only scan my freight but rescan their freight in. I tried to explain this to leadership and advise who was the problem but, they rather pull a whole group aside instead of the the individual making the mistake. Bottom line when you scan something in right, it has a different tone beep and goes green showing it was scanned successfully and it does the opposite if you don't scan it in properly.

This year, there was no peak pay offered for the drastically increased workload. According to long-term employees, last year they made $1K a week with the incentivized pay. Instead, managers walk around giving jolly ranchers and rubber ducks.

934,"Amazon has the absolute best Leadership Principles I have ever experienced. When they are followed, they produce the greatest results, and that is what makes Amazon so great. Amazon also has some of the most committed leaders I've ever had the pleasure of working with. There is a significant and noticeable difference between those that always do what's right, and those that just tell you what you want to hear. Most of the time, Ops will come around and make the necessary changes without putting up a fight. Know when to move on by transferring to another site. This is very site and Business Unit specific. The grass truly is greener at other sites.","When I started with Amazon, the principle ""You own your career"" was encouraging and motivating. Career opportunities are stunted by lack of shift rotation for proper exposure to the site leaders, and lack of experience level by managers that don't know how to recognize talent and Develop the Best. Req's are often filled before they are opened, and it has become about ""Who you know"" instead of what you have accomplished and what you have to contribute. This creates barriers for those that are ready to be promoted, relocating, looking to transfer, etc. Amazon needs to get back to the pre-Covid standards across the board. It's time for us to ""Return to Normal"" starting with the associate cell phones not being allowed on the FC floor. The increased number of rest periods is having an adverse effect and increasing rate of injury. Amazon has 20 years of operation prior to Covid and we need to use that data to drive the Safety Culture.",nil

952,"I found the interview process to be incredibly informative and equitable. Interviewing at Amazon is rigorous but I felt like I had all the information I needed to prepare, and then I liked that it was up to me to put my all into that preparation. It felt great to have that culminate in an offer. Every interviewer I met was totally engaged, not distracted even though the chats were remote, and I felt like I was meeting people I could learn from and collaborate with. Now that I'm on the team, that feeling has been validated. Everyone I encounter goes the extra mile and is passionate about the shared Amazon culture and purpose.","I think Amazon onboarding at Amazon requires a real self-starter approach, that may not be what everyone is looking for as they jump into a new role. The self-serve culture requires tenacity and curiosity. For people looking for more guidance and context in a new role, Amazon may not be a fit. The sheer size and scale of the businesses are definitely an adjustment (even coming from other big tech players), and that too is a big adjustment.",nil

955,#NAME?,"- Productivity expectations were unsustainable. All tasks were timed. 1-2 minute breaks in-between tasks (bathroom, getting water) were not actually able to be taken if daily goal was to be reached (you could physically take the break but the task clock would be running). Several teammates worked off the clock on the down-low to actually meet their goals to avoid being penalized, further inaccurately supporting managements productivity expectations. Goals for productivity and sales would change with little notice. Many members of the team were put on coaching plans to improve how fast they could work, or fired for not being fast enough. The more like a computer you were, the better. - Went from flexible hourly schedule to schedule-bidding based on stack-ranking. Teammates who were needing supplementary income (due to our low pay) had to leave part-time evening jobs and work odd shift times, or quit. - No internal growth opportunities after 3+ years on the team. Limited growth opportunities to move to other teams in different job functions (team was ranked as L3 but considered corporate). - Limited yearly raise for top performers, no raise for cost of living adjustment. Essentially, a pay-cut in the final years due to rising inflation and cost of living in one of the nation's most expensive cities. No severance packages (these specific attributes apply to THIS team, not Amazon teams as a whole). - Lack of communication from upper management on program direction or changes. There were quarterly All-Hands meetings and then silence in-between. Towards the end, team-wide meetings were postponed, a sure sign of something being wrong pre-layoffs.",nil
