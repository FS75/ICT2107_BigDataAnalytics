What I am mentioning below is not just a personal experience. I was the last person to exit from my team who had all faced similar situatons.

CoVid: To start off, these guys were the last to shut down offices when covid started! Despite the complaints and agitations. As a result, a heavy percentage of young workforce got trapped in PGs for a really long time. Their infrastructure was not prepared for WFH and productivity took a hit. And instead of relaxing the timelines, they made it worse! 9 hr. day turned to 15 hr. soon and then the immediate managers started showing their colors. I was literally asked to have paracetamol and work when I had covid.

Usual scene: There is insane amount of favourism and mafia type situation, starting from junior management itself. Talent is worshiped here too! But don't expect accelerated growth just because of that. You will just be a very talented mule. Don't expect good ratings and increments just because you did good job. One of my colleagues got bad rating just because she complaint about here manager. He was rude because she could not deliver as she was stuck in a PG without proper internet, food and water!!!
