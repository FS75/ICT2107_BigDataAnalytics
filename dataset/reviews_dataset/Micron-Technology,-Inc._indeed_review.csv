What is a typical day like for you at the company?
Work was good, cutting edge, exciting. Co-workers are excellent - but diminishing as they are tired of being forced to embrace morals and political stances that differ from their own.

4.0,"Great Culture, Great People, but Poor Job Security","I was hired by Micron about 8 months ago. I loved my job and considered it my dream job. The opportunities for learning are limitless, and I always felt productive and valued. The people are great - I loved my manager and everyone I worked with. The culture is fantastic - the systems in place to protect the wafer and the worker are very superior to anywhere I have ever worked. Management frequently emphasizes safety, quality, and workplace performance excellence. Everyone is on the same team, and the office politics and/or backstabbing is negligible compared to everywhere I've ever been. I went on maternity leave shortly after being hired, and never felt like it might inhibit my chances of making management one day. Women are frequently promoted to management, so I was hopeful and very motivated. One negative of working there was that I frequently felt stressed by the sheer scale of the workload, so much so that I frequently skipped lunch, stayed late, and came in early. But I worked through it hoping that it would get better once the hiring freeze was lifted. In the two months before my position was eliminated, I had spent many late nights and weekends finishing up a project of fab-wide importance. The project was finally winding down, and we were ahead of schedule. I had also just won an award for quality excellence regarding my work for the automotive audit. I finally felt like I was learning the ropes of the new job and on track for promotion. Then I got called into an unexpected meeting with my manager. My position was eliminated due to random head count",,,CVD Process Engineer,Former Employee,"Manassas, VA","March 4, 2023"
5.0,Productive and fun workplace,"Have peers close to my age to connect with, makes work life better and easier going. Usually on a time crunch with lots of inline issues to solve to drive product yield up. Extremely good benefits and casual work environment with little to no politics. Managers are down to earth and on your level in terms of friendliness.",,,Process Engineer,Former Employee,Woodlands,"March 3, 2023"

2.0,Bad Internships,"Worked there initially as a floor technician intern. Most of my ""internship"" was spent filling a hole for missing team members. Not more than 4 months later, another team member left.
My second year I was told I would be doing more engineering work - This was not the case, and I continued acting as a floor technician until 6 months before I left.
All in all, not a good experience. They let me go due to COVID19 limiting how many new interns they could hire, but there were new ones walking in the door weekly.",,,Process Engineer Intern,Former Employee,"Manassas, VA","March 1, 2023"
3.0,So-so working environment,"Among all the workplaces that I've worked for, here provides the best facility for workers. But, work environment are all just the same. Some colleagues are good and some colleagues are bad. Bad in my languange can be refers to taking advantage of other coleagues, taking credits for other colleagues works and other things that I don't need to explain more. We just need to be more adaptable and become flexible to suit ourself well in this type of working environment.",,,Admin Support,Current Employee,Muar,"March 1, 2023"
1.0,Toxic Management,Overall this place thrives on workplace politics rather than meaningfully making contributions. Some teams get good managers I was lucky there . But overall not a great place to grow but a great place settle without doing anything and just indulging in the politics and meaningless responsibilities.,,,Process Control Systems Engineer,Former Employee,"Manassas, VA","February 24, 2023"
2.0,Management lacks at all levels,"I have never seen a more insecure executive suite. Having been at Micron since the Steve Appleton days, the current c-suite doesn’t compare. They lack coherent vision, have decimated the culture and only provide lip service to employee concerns. This isn’t the company I started working for, and it only continues to reward people that are toxic to the culture. The executive team needs to take a critical look at themselves and exit. The values are performative, and aren’t applied in practice.",,,Communications Specialist,Current Employee,"San Jose, CA","February 22, 2023"
2.0,Highly Competitive Environment,"Training was inconsistent and too often incomplete. This was extremely difficult to overcome in such a competitive environment.

Management did not have a good grasp of the day to day dynamics. Due to the increasingly competitive nature selfishness was rewarded. Equipment access was not equal among team members. Some team members were allowed to actively hoard and dominate shared equipment forcing others to use outdated and inadequate equipment. This made hitting weekly goals difficult. Which was used to against you in performance ratings.

Executive Management often talked about the importance of work life balance. That was not the reality. Being out on FLMA was held against your performance averages and reviews. Scheduled time off was also held against weekly performance averages. Job security is non existent.",,,Process Engineer,Former Employee,"Boise, ID","February 15, 2023"
4.0,"Stressful, Monetary Rewarding, Challenging","Micron is a great place to work if you are money motivated, enjoy a fast pace, and competitive environment. The work is rewarding, most of the people are good to work with collaboratively and work under, and the salary and benefits are some of the best. They have a very limited tolerance for mistakes, no respect for work/life balance, and expect to be working at least 50-60hours a week if you plan to advance. I’d caution those applying that this is a live fast, die young environment and it’s constant state of change. If you manage to survive one of the many downturn layoffs and/or not get fired on a moving performance scale, don’t expect to have a long career. You will give 110%+ per day for years, and they will still expect more; nothing you do will ever be enough. Most of the equipment is top notch, but management refuses to hire enough people to stop burnout of the existing employees. The combination of overwork, stress, perfectionism, lack of work/life balance vs the benefits, salary, and brief moments of success will not always balance each other.",,,Employee,Current Employee,USA,"February 13, 2023"

3.0,Hourly employee,"Micron has great programs to help with a wide range of issues, unfortunately they only seem to apply to salaried employees. 12 hr shifts, 365/yr. Job responsibilities constantly change and more keeps getting added to meet expectations. Rating system is setup that someone has to get a low rating, despite no deserving it.

Good working culture with supportive team",Good benefits. Good pay and bonuses,None,Technologist,Former Employee,Woodlands,"February 9, 2023"
2.0,"Great coworkers, poor management","Honestly, the company would be great if upper management spent some more time on the floor understanding issues. One of the fab disciplines is go to the point of work (the floor) and I almost never saw upper management in a cleanroom gown.
The initial manager would come up every now and then to get a firsthand account of the floor and would occasionally supervise cleans and participate in the troubleshooting with the engineers at the tool, as well as watching fixes performed by the vendors. Perfectly fine and completely respect that. The manager above him only really seemed to come up when there was a lot of down tools in a given time or a tool was down a long time and only stuck around long enough for a quick explanation of what was wrong and the initial steps towards fixing it. I don't think I've ever seen a manager higher than that go to the floor, either for emergencies or to get a pulse on the work situation from technicians. Pretty sure they keep their ears closed, too. Number one complaint from the department was lack of personnel, as there is a pretty high tool per capita in the department. So the higher-ups response was to freeze hiring and then layoff people. This was in the middle of fab expansion. But they had to save costs while also having a company build a brand-new cafeteria with all sorts of fancy stuff that they already signed the contract for during covid. Like a mini dot-com bubble.
A different, more universal, complaint was meetings. They want people to pay attention during meetings so multi-tasking during them is discouraged, but this led to less time",,,Equipment Engineer,Former Employee,"Manassas, VA","February 8, 2023"
4.0,Easy/Fun learning environment,"Overall it’s a great company. some days are harder than others and higher ups are demanding more. Short staffed on occasions

5.0,"Great Internship, Bummed About Hiring Freeze","I had a great experience at my summer internship at Micron. I was a marketing intern in San Jose. Micron was fabulous- they paid my relocation expenses, offset apartment costs, and even provided travel stipend. The only sad part was I didn't get a follow-up offer simply because of their hiring freeze. Otherwise, I would work for Micron again in a heartbeat.",,,Comms and Marketing Operations Intern,Former Employee,"San Jose, CA","January 17, 2023"
2.0,Good if you’re willing to bleed micron at all times.,"If you’re looking for a job where you are expected to live for the company then this is the place. Pay is low even for the boise idaho area, claiming no funds but construction never stops and money is wasted at an extreme rate.
In short I witnessed many many people destroyed by this company and it’s horrible management.

3.0,Management not systematic,Worked more than a year. had faith on this company that i can have my career growth but now all the benefits freeze and especially no increment ..going to be like 2 years no increment.

4.0,Supportive team members and healthy work/life balance,"Lots of opportunities to learn new skills and topics since Micron has so many various teams. Career advancement is just okay, they sometimes struggle to retain young talent due to this. Work/life balance is generally very good, other than their confusing refusal to enable fully remote workers. Honestly hard to get fired here other than general layoffs, so safe job security. The people are nice and most that I have worked with have been supportive and seem to genuinely care for each other's health, safety, and happiness. Food is subsidized so it's cheap ($1-2 for lunch most days). The pay is often lagging behind other similar roles at other companies, depending on the location, but the benefits are very good. Micron uses a performance grading system that doesn't always feel like it rewards a year's worth of effort and contributions.",,,Engineer 2,Current Employee,"Boise, ID","December 2, 2022"

Minimal Work life balance.

Combined with those who left due to vaccination mandate, many departments/shifts severely understaffed. Many people work maximum OT just so to keep some shifts afloat.

The Bad: Unrealistic expectations and poor work life balance","Micron management will encourage you to take your career where you want to go. But they will setup roadblocks in the form of unrealistic expectations, low headcount/poor support, pay raises that do not keep up with cost of living. At Micron, People is a core value, but management's lack of support for the teams shows that to be a poor lie. Work Life balance is quite poor. There is an unspoken expectation that an engineer needs to be on call and available to support project work at all hours. This leads to burnout and the current exodus from the company. In short, Micron is a good place to start your career, but don't put down roots. Plan to take your career to another company.",,,Engineer,Current Employee,"Boise, ID","January 26, 2022"

Do you want to work where any means necessary is how you get things done? If so this is your place. Micron is currently experiencing a mass exodus due to how upper management is driving the company culture. While on print ""People"" is one of Micron's core values, it isn't how things actually work inside of the company. Massive head count restrictions mean that there is rarely the resources to meet deadlines, but you'll still held accountable to deadlines that were established outside of the laws of reality. The silos that exists between groups means that the right hand doesn't care what the left hand is doing let alone want to know about it.

5.0,Fast-paced work place,"People culture in the company makes it a pleasant place to work in, engagement & feedback surveys are taken seriously and required to be acted upon by supervisors by the company system. For young employees/engineers, claimable overtime pay makes the high intensity & heavy workload bearable, but monthly salary (base + overtime) will be capped at 6.2k, good for fresh graduates as a stepping stone in their career. Opportunities for internal job switching are available for new experiences.

Cons

In the manufacturing field, knowledge & experience gained is very specialized for the manufacturing field and for very specialized technology. Nature of manufacturing requires 24h attention that will mean frequent losing out on rest time outside office hours as there will always be problems arising. Limited positions to climb up especially for managerial roles and above as more engineers & technicians are required due to the manufacturing nature of the company.",,,Intern,Former Employee,Woodlands,"December 20, 2021"

3.0,Stressful work environment from management who leads by fear.,The rating system causes people to not share information. Useless projects are mandatory to get a better than average rating. You can not be just good at your role to get an above average rating. Management style is different from one department to another. CVD department makes technicians scared to make a mistake which leads to ownership issues. Management needs to recognize individual talents. Not every technician is the same. Some are good at doing projects and some are excellent troubleshooters. To get a better than average rating you have to be good in all areas. The culture has gone down hill in the last several years.

4.0,Nice work environment,I enjoyed my time at Micron. My only concern was my commute and the long hrs. I don’t feel this company is for someone who has a family. If you’re single then this would be a great job. Working here I missed out on a lot of my kids lives including school functions which resulted in angry children.

3.0,"Awesome pay, good company, I'm only ok with my job.","Overall, Micron is a good company. They compensate well and have great benefits. US manufacturing operations continue to transfer overseas, which isn't great. If you are in a manufacturing supporting role, you can expect a lot of evening meetings and late nights. (This is also true for any role that needs to collaborate globally).
HR is pushing for a better work life balance, which many can work out. There often is flexibility in your schedule if you do have to work late. But to really advance in the company you can expect to work 50-60 hours regularly. So I don't think the culture really supports a healthy work life balance, especially if you have a family.
My direct management is pretty good. Coworkers are awesome! The company sometimes makes decisions that negativity impact employees, including occasional layoffs. I work often believing my department could be next, which is unsettling.
Work here is demanding and stressful with high expectations. But you learn a lot and gain a lot of experience if you work hard. Burn out can happen if you aren't careful. Benefits and retention bonuses are awesome, but make it difficult to consider leaving for other opportunities. My friend calls that the ""Golden Handcuffs"".
My job is OK. My role has changed over the past few years, and isn't as much of what it was when I applied for it. This is due to shifts in business needs, organization changes, and management changes.

2.0,worked 4 days on and 3 days off.,Micron was a decent company to work for but you had to work the entire shift unless you became terribly ill.

4.0,Communication is the key,"Micron was a position that I had sought for some time. an international company headquartered near my home, that was willing to let me use the skills I have, and learn the ones that I don't. Overall the experience was one of the best that I've ever had, and would take it again if given the chance.

BUT, you do have to talk to people, and ensure that they understand what you are saying, and the same for you. Communication is a two-way street, and there has to be a ""meeting of the minds"" at some point. And know that if you go too far ahead of the curve, you're on your own.

Expectations are high, and the culture of the business is deeply entrenched. Change is tolerated, as long as it works out of the box, with few errors, and NONE that bring the system down as a whole. Communicating with your supervisor is always a god thing, but it can also become a double-edged sword if not done properly. Assumptions need to be left at home, far from the workplace, because anything can change on a moment's notice.","Strong, cohesive teams with common goals, and often common skillsets.

4.0,"Great benefits, structural problems","Micron is a fast paced semiconductor manufacturer. they'll train you on your toolset, they'll give you great benefits, but they've got one major flaw.

They cant trust, or keep, good technicians.

Micron has fantastic work/life balance- we work 12s, but we get 4 days off one weekend, and 3 the next. most of us prefer this schedule to a regular 9-5. they have lots of great benefits like employee stock programs, great healthcare, and they offer 12 weeks of parental leave for both women AND men, so if you're thinking of having a kid in the next few years, you'll be hard pressed to match that. You get a crazy amount of paid time off on top of that- so much that people often have a hard time taking it all. You also get 100 minutes of break every day (only 30 minutes unpaid for lunch) The pay is less than other comparable semiconductor manufacturers, like intel, but that isn't their problem. Their problem is inherent with the organization and how upper-middle management works

you can be a fantastic employee, and you can suggest lots of solutions to large problems, but if its not something you can fix yourself, it won't get fixed anytime soon. They constantly ignore the existence of massive, department and fab-wide problems, and if you bring them up, you're suddenly the bad guy, and it doesn't matter because they don't want to address them. They want to put on a nice act for their bosses, and their customers. Further than that, you'll find that getting much needed help on tool problems is problematic at best, because the engineers are much too pre-occupied with attending meetings -

4.0,"Interesting work, continuous development required","A typical day at work will include several repetitive tasks, such as changing tool consumables. In addition, you will likely always be required to do something that you don't know how to, whether it is administrative (generating parts reports), or troubleshooting something faulting.

You learn/adapt fast, or perish here. If that's for you, then you'll do very well.

Culture is VERY mixed from top down, which is to say, the top doesn't care about anything the bottom does. Your immediate boss, and the person above them will care that you're well-off at your job, anything above that will view you as a number, and will make your life a nightmare just to fit the bell curve.

Hardest part is also the best part... which is schedule. it's 12 hour shifts, but compressed work weeks.

The company gets grandoise ideas on taking the company in new directions, focuses on it for a year or two and then releases all the new hires they brought on for the project so they can focus on something new and save more money. The real thing that bothers me about this practice is that it doesn't even count against their bottom line when they let go so many workers because they hired them through independent hiring agencies are paid by separate companies (such as Kelly Services).

Good mentorship for new hires. Culture of sharing knowledge allows one to quickly assimilate into a new role.

Company makes it a point to celebrate important milestones and are willing to spend money (such as booking the whole Universal Studios for a day) to do so.

Minus points:
Except for a select few teams, generally very stingy about providing training opportunities. Middle management has the mindset that all skills (including AI and Deep Learning) can be mastered through one week of googling or a few high-level internal sharing sessions, and naively expects to see such mastery quickly. This frustrates employees who feel that they cannot grow in their roles.
The campaign for work-life balance is just paying lip service. Poor work-life balance for any role that supports production line. And middle management makes no attempt to improve the situation.

3.0,Bad experience due to 1 particular manager,"Super stressful and biased. But this is due to 1 particular manager who picked on me and is obvious to the team as well.

In my scope, I have had the opportunity to work with many managers and directors. As much as they are demanding, they are fair and reasonable, nothing personal, just work to be done. These managers and directors would be present for meetings and protect their team when grilled. The particular manager, my direct superior, is nothing like them. He missed meetings, never prepare his own materials during presentations, picked on me like nobody business like shouting during morning meeting, arrange for late meeting for more bantering session for an hour. Even my team ever approached me to ask if i have crossed him in anyway or perhaps had dated his daughter before. In a year there, i lost hours of sleep and was diagnosed with hypertension.

3.0,No training,Micron is unorganized in so many ways. Training is the worst for a place that has been doing manufacturing for 30+ years you would think they would have a structured training program. And management from 2 tier has no idea what happens on production floor and are constantly making it harder for production workers to do there job.

As a salaried worker it was expected to put in 13 to 14 hours or more a day, and every weekend there were meetings that you were expected to attend. When I first started I quickly realized I was only one bad manager away from hitting the road. When Micron brought in a couple of headhunters from Lehi I knew my days were numbered. I had always been rated in the 4 range in their 1 to 5 ratings, 5 being the highest, suddenly I'm a 2. Thank God they offered a severance, I have never regretted leaving and just wished I would have done so sooner.

4.0,"Decent workplace/compensation, company is working to modernize","The worst part about Micron is the culture. There is an overwhelming atmosphere in many departments that solutions need to be as complex as possible - for job security, and information needs to kept internal as much as possible - to claim credit for accomplishments. There are various reasons for this, and some are valid and appropriate (such as limiting data access for security reasons), but many boil down to petty office politics and international culture clashes. In general, the company culture issues are between teams and larger organizations, not individuals.
Otherwise, compensation seems pretty fair, and you get the feeling that upper management is legitimately working to modernize and scale the company, as Micron's historical business strategies (buying up all the competition) don't really apply anymore, and many of the original/older employees are retiring or being retired.",,,Process Control Engineer,Current Employee,"Boise, ID","February 12, 2020"

1.0,Bell curve rating system that cuts employees every year,"Micron bases their yearly reviews off a bell curve system that promotes silos and destroys collaboration. No one is helpful because if you succeed they can get a lower rating so everyone is against everyone. Ratings are based off the bell curve so it doesnt matter how you do all year round it's based off how you compare to your coworkers. Also, the yearly reviews are based off the bell curve and every year right before Thanksgiving they fire the low performers to prevent paying bonuses.",,,Product Manager,Former Employee,"Boise, ID","February 8, 2020"

It seemed that working a compressed work week would be fantastic but in the end I spent my entire ""weekend"" catching up from things that couldn't be done after work on a typical workday. With a family it was tough, I'd leave before my daughter wakes up and come home and she would be in bed.

Working there was a fantastic learning experience, its just too bad that the micro management was not worth my sanity. I worked for the department of Photolithography and while it was great while it lasted you truly feel as though you are being criticized behind your back way too much.

2.0,Enjoyable work. Poor management.,"The day to day work is enjoyable.
Annual employee reviews are not a review of your work, but a review of how popular you are and if you had any mistakes over the year.
Frequent layoffs, or layoffs disguised as ""early retirement"" or ""poor performance review""
Pay is sub-par for the area. Pay increases of only 1-2% are considered large, even though they don't cover cost of living increases.
Interactions with immediate co-workers are great. Lower management is good. Upper management considers everyone to be just a number not a person. The only time they seem to care is when its the annual internal review of their performance.
Real solutions to problems are not wanted by management, only solutions that look good on paper, because the solutions aren't implemented.",,,Electronics Technician,Current Employee,"Boise, ID","October 25, 2019"

3.0,Not Great for Creative/Innovative People,"Micron in general is a great place to work. They try to hire the best technical people and are at the top of the game in the semiconductor business. My particular experience is probably outside of the norm, since I was hired to work on essentially a skunkworks project, but I found that the management is too much ""by the book"" and does not foster an environment of creativity and innovative. Instead, they have resorted to a ""management by spreadsheet"" mentality, which works for a manufacturing-oriented organization, but not a world-class engineering organization. All of that said, I would likely give Micron another shot if the right opportunity came along.",,,Senior Technical Marketing Manager,Former Employee,"Boise, ID","October 19, 2019"

Experience might vary from one engineer to another. Some engineers requires to work in line,while others need to concentrate in data mining and data optimization.

There are several meetings through out the day. Some of the meeting are important and informative,while some are redundant.

Managers are prompt in addressing an issue and acting on it immediately.Top management puts a lot of pressure on the directors/managers and engineers to fulfill the target by/before the target date.

Most managers and directors do not believe in the term 'work-life balance'. Engineers are expected to bring back their laptops home and work from home on weekends .

Micron provides many on job training,but the quality of the training completely depends on the trainer.

Since there is a lot of pressure from day to day,the learning curve is extremely steep. The job requires an engineer to align with cross functional team, to analyze data, to collaboration with team mates , technicians and operators, to understand minute details about processes and tools etc. So however the pressure is, at the end of the day the pay is very good and there are many opportunities to learn and rise up the ladder.",,,Process Engineer - Operation Excellence,Former Employee,Singapore,"September 19, 2019"

There are two cafeterias with dining outside available.
There is a recreational area, and weight room, and medical facilities on site.
There is free fruit on Fridays.
Working remotely is allowed.
Work is 24x7, most support is over seas so it will eat heavily into evenings. Paging at night is constant and required to be answered in 20 minutes.
Meetings are often and support tickets flow in continuously but are not expected to be used as excuses for missing deadlines on projects. You will be rated against your peers so no matter how well you are doing the actual job, if your peers are doing it better you'll be let go. Annual reviews are done on a bell curve.

4.0,Changes and Lack of Direction,"Constant organizational changes, no clear and concise method on being super successful day-to-day. Focusing too much on money instead of quality will unfortunately be the ultimate downfall. Great experiences with the people but the management has been very tough to stomach sometimes. Thankful my supervisor was great but the other departments have caused many issues because of personal outside issues.

1.0,Overall it was a bad experience,"From the first day I knew something was up. I was so excited to start this contract, but from the first day there was this sense that I wasn't needed. There was poor communication between my direct manager and myself. My emails would go unanswered and his interactions with me were very brief and terse. This caused me great anxiety from the start, because I had just come from a large successful project where I was the lead and knew the entire system inside and out. So I went from being in charge of a large important project to feeling like I was silo-ed and shut out. My manager couldn't careless. He was either too busy or just didn't care.

The team of developers I worked with were good smart and talented... but the projects and work were inconsistent and at times aimless with vague requirements and no demos to show off progress... it all just felt like a waste of time.

This was a short term contract so I can't complain too much... but a week before they let me go, they told me that they had extended my contract for another year. So it was a big shock when the next week they turned around and let me go. Evidently it was due to budget cuts and even my direct manager wasn't aware. At least that's what I was told.",,,Engineering Architect,Former Employee,Work from Home,"September 3, 2019"

2.0,No work-life balance or career path,"I've heard there are groups that are good to work in... I didn't see it.
The hardest part of the job is putting in the effort for people who respond with hints of moving your position overseas.
The most enjoyable part is seeing your product in the store.
After a few years, despite all the motivational talk, I realized the silo mentality is killing the company. The silo leads to managers more concerned with validating their existence than understanding what their employees do and how to make improvements. We routinely worked with other groups who had no clue we existed or why we were necessary to the process. Towards the end, I realized our own manager didn't understand our primary process or even the meaning of the acronym. (It's a bit like discovering your football coach doesn't know what a touchdown is.)
The old guard tells stories of working their way up from operator, bonuses, and employee patents, but that was before operations started moving overseas. They are too busy ""cutting costs"" to see it is bleeding the company.
It seems that the managers ignore the human factor of their employees. I.e. balancing authority with responsibility, maintaining employee morale, fatigue, work-life balance, career interests.
My group experienced 4 or 5 reorgs in 3 years. After 3 reorgs, we were back where they started. Each time, we were told our jobs wouldn't change. Mostly, the reorgs created chaos and allowed the transient managers to add to their resume.
Our boss in Asia hired new teammates over there, gave them clear assignments and promotions, then let us languished.",,,Engineer,Former Employee,"Boise, ID","May 30, 2019"

Advancement is near impossible, because they cut costs by hiring interns right out of college instead of promoting the educated and experienced that have already been working there and have proven themselves.

Management: Good nature on the bottom, irregular on the top, and stake holders are held dear on the top. Don't expect favors or emphasis on employees. They are tightening the reins on the community which is shifting how the people react. A lot of reactionary changes happen and seem loosely thought out.

Culture: Techs are close knit community and will help each other out. Laziness gets rooted out pretty quickly as each person is needed.
Expect it too be almost solely OJT with another person.

Hardest part of the job: No tech manuals or schematics. A lot of tribal knowledge happens.

2.0,You will become a zombe over time!,"Nothing has been the same since Steve has been gone and the management is now horrible with the attitude that you are lucky to have a job and they have no clue about what is going on in the manufacturing areas.

96% of the production occurs in Asia, overseas training occurs during the night so you are expected to work your normal day hours and then be on call all night long. My typical work day is 6:00am till 6:00pm and then once you are home remote logging in until midnight or later at locations all over the world. Scheduled vacation time is not really vacation at all as you are asked to still login from wherever you are and keep machines running.

Expect long nights, no life, unrealistic deadlines, and all the managers taking credit for your hard work and long hours.

If you do something good then management is always there to take the credit for it. Be prepared for them to ask you to do things unethical and if something negative comes out of it they will play as they know nothing about it.

Micron used to be the best place in the world to work. Now it has gotten so big that you are now a number. Stock options are gone, bonuses are very small, and everyone has a very negative outlook about everything now days.

There are some good departments at Micron to work for, so if you are going to apply for a job at this company do your homework and find the good departments or else do not waste your time here.

Micron has grown to the point they no longer know what they do best, much like many of the large tech companies, HP to wit. They are languishing and perpetually lagging their foreign competition.

5.0,"A fantastic working environment, so much to learn, and so many ways to grow","The shift always starts with a ""passdown"" from the previous shift of issues, upcoming problems and efforts needed by the oncoming workers. Then there is emails and machine running statistics that need checked for trending problems. Pages notify of problems needing repaired as they occur, lists of machines that need preventative maintenance that week. Possible engineering experiments that need monitored. The 12 hour shifts actually stay busy most of the shift.

There were classes for further learning on site. Training on new machines from SME (Subject Matter Experts) and new repair procedures that need reviewed and checked for accuracy.

Management is involved and on task. Typically they are approachable and willing to be friendly with employees.

Co-Workers are capable, and from various backgrounds making them interesting to work with over the course of long shifts for half a week. Training is ongoing and constant so there is rarely issues with incapable workers.

Getting used to the shifts are difficult, but once used to no different than other work days, and the benefit becomes long weekends and longer vacation weeks for minimum time off. But the shifts are hard as they cause schedule shifts at home for the employee.

My co-workers and managers are very encouraging and accepting personal thoughts in each project. We all have one goal, which is to provide value-added recommendations for the company's benefit.

Learned different types of equipment and had to learn different types of manufacturing processes to keep up with the effects on the equipment. This was an R&D fab and was very interesting and fun. Co-workers were fun to work with and engineering was very accommodating with cause and effect troubleshooting. This was the most enjoyable part of the job.
The hardest part of the job was attending all the meetings. I know they are necessary to report and give your own reports to the team members, but there were so many that some seemed redundant. The second rough part was a few management types seemed to forget this was an R&D fab, and were running in manufacturing mode, so when we were trying to figure out why equipment or processes were not working, they wanted the equipment cleaned and running. We needed the equipment and the processes running right, seeking quality not quantity. While limiting down time to make the part was important, knowing the reason for failures is more important. The trick was to figure out the correct balance to satisfy both goals....",,,Equipment Maintenance Technician,Former Employee,"Boise, ID","March 19, 2014"
4.0,Work hard and play hard.,"Micron was a growing company with many challenges and opportunities for advancement. As technicians there we were forced to think outside of the box and constantly pushing the envelope to develop or modify equipment to do things they weren't originally designed to do. The shift was 12 hours long with a 30 minute lunch break and the day started with a pass down from the outgoing shift to bring up to speed with what was going on. The supervisor then discussed the priorities and every one started working. When a piece of equipment was repaired it was put through a series of quality tests and the results were reviewed by a second technician. It it passed all of the test the part was bagged, tagged and placed in inventory. If it failed it was torn down to discover the reason it failed and reworked. For me the toughest part of the job was getting adjusted to night shift because we rotated shifts every four months. The first week of shift change was particularly challenging because of the change in sleep habits.The best part of the job was the feeling of satisfaction you got when you repaired a subassembly and it went into the production area and did not come out until it was pulled because of regularly scheduled maintenance.",,,Principal Equipment Technician,Former Employee,"Boise, Idaho","March 19, 2014"

4.0,Good place to work and build your skills,"Worked at Micron as an equipment technician. If you like to tinker with and fix things, it is an enjoyable job. Because it is a high volume fab, sometimes the pressure you are under can suck the fun out of a successful repair. I was fortunate enough that most of my peers were folks with good character and a generally good work ethic. I was also able to learn from seasoned technicians who were eager to pass along their knowledge. There is a bit of micro-management going on, but because of the nature of a high volume factory, it goes with the territory. The only real beef with the place I personally have is that promotion can be tough and sometimes you can get stuck where you are at for long time. The 12 hour shifts can be rough and you can lose time with family and friends, but if you're used to it, you almost don't notice it.","decent pay, good benefits, time off earned quickly","shift work rotating days/nights, micro management, company losses",Equipment Technician,Former Employee,"Manassas, VA","February 12, 2013"

4.0,Ambiente lavorativo stimolante,"La giornata lavorativa in Micron , non si puo' certo definire tipica, in quanto non è una catena di montaggio, si lavora in ambiente sterile e i turni, diurni e notturni, durano dodici ore. Si arriva sul posto di lavoro e si indossano indumenti protettivi atti a non contaminare il materiale in lavorazione (semiconduttori); successivamente si prendono le consegne dal turno precedente, quindi si procede allo svolgimento del lavoro.

Ho imparato la meticolosità nel rispetto delle procedure e grazie a ciò, ho riscontrato che il lavoro prodotto può raggiungere risultati eccellenti.

Non ho mai avvertito l'esigenza di giudicare il management in maniera negativa, consapevole che a volte decisioni prese impopolari erano dovute a politiche aziendali rivolte a più ampi orizzonti.

Il personale dipendente, essendo molto numeroso, non poteva che abbracciare tipologie variegate, personalmente non ho mai avuto problemi con nessuno.

I turni notturni irrimediabilmente alterano l'orologio biologico essendo di dodici ore.

Ho lavorato in un'ambiente dove si utilizzavano soprattutto terminologie e software in lingua inglese, di conseguenza ero proiettata in contesti internazionali e questo mi ha arricchito professionalmente.",,,operatoratrice specializzata,Former Employee,Avezzano (AQ),"September 29, 2012"
