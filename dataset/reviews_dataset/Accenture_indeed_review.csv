Then they throw you on the floor expecting you to have a 95% overall rating on all of the calls or you don’t get a bonus for three months. The job is absolutely complicated and the management treats you like you are stupid if you ask questions. HORRIBLE HORRIBLE job. They don’t care if you know what you’re doing.

After very little marketing training they expect you to be an expert and just ""wing it"" for months in a field that you know nothing about. Some of the trainers were very warm and knowledgeable and some were chaotic and others were lazy and useless lol.

Their metrics and leaders are not there for guidance but for compliance.

The training provided by Accenture was insufficient and poorly structured, which made it difficult for me to learn the necessary skills to excel in my role.

3.0,management style varies depending on region and project,"Pros
- Paid on time
- Compensation is ok
- Enforced culture from very top (C-suite level) discourages most managers from openly displaying toxicity (if they are prone to it)
- Minority of colleagues are nice and competent

Cons
- There are lots of ways to be misbehave sneakily (for example, ignoring unusual issues that do not fall under any particular function's domain as it's 'not my responsibility.')
- 'me first' mentality propagated from top-down resulted in a selfish work culture, where everything can be justified by 'as long as I am not the one affected'
- incompetent colleagues will choose to chase KPIs rather than actual results (burden shifted onto those who produce real work, with no recognition)
- lack of drive in the organisation to do better, even though company tagline for customers is providing '360° value'
- lack of transparency results in all blame being sneakily shifted onto scapegoats (easy targets)
- foundational issues are left to rot until unsavoury incidents happen
- management can u-turn on decisions very quickly with catastrophic results, without sound reasoning or taking any accountability
- management had bad practices in overbilling clients to boost their performance, shifting blame on grassroots staff when they get caught",,,Operations Associate,Former Employee,Kuala Lumpur,"January 20, 2023"

Our leaders really listen to people, and help along the way, they remove bad leaders who cause toxic or who is ""doing nothing"".
However, not all project have good leaders and management. Some projects may not consider the employee's well-being due to tight deadlines and bad commitments/management, at the end of the day it depends on which project you're deployed into and if the managers are really listening to their employees' feedback. Most of these bad comments I am sharing are from people I know, outside my project, who are client facing.
Either way, it is still a great company for me because they have best employee benefits.

I was sad to be redeployed, and it can happen to anyone. My team was only given a weeks notice of the project ending, and it was over the holidays. I still have not received anything from HR about what to do next.",,,Content Reviewer,Current Employee,"Austin, TX","November 30, 2022"
4.0,Looking for balance of the good stuff? Here's an employment worth investing for retirement,"Been with Accenture for 12yrs and quite honestly, It's been an up-and-down journey. There are times I'd feel so disengaged and resentful of the company. Which I believe, can happen to anyone especially to those who stays at least long enough. In fact, there were points when I didn't deserve to be kept anymore, but I'm still here despite some bad bosses trying to manage me out. Goes to show that even if there are isolated cases of bad people, they can't just easily get their ways. ACN won't allow that and just let you go. There's always fair and due process where you're always heard even if the case is so obvious. Even if you're let go, you're let go gracefully in a way they care to make sure you'd still find another job. We all know nothing is perfect. We're not too good to be true, neither are we bad. Not even close. There's nothing bad in Accenture that you won't otherwise find in other companies like politics, bad bosses/leaders, toxic colleagues, workload, or team/project/department, etc. Sometimes, it's just a matter of luck and/or perspective. When someone is in a bad situation, tendency is to think the company is bad which may not necessarily be true. Just as much as another employee may be very happy with the situation but may not necessarily mean the company is good. A place is only as good as the people in it. And I can say that in general, most people are good people in here. I've most especially realized I was wrong to resent the company as a whole and appreciate them for their great integrity. Just imagine they first projected to decline due to pandemic. Despite",,,Software Quality Engineering Specialist/Team Lead,Current Employee,Mandaluyong City,"November 30, 2022"

2.0,Great Benefits/Managers are horrible leaders,Loved the pay and The benefits and mentorship on the company is not good. Managers say they do not have time for you but mainly sit on their time. Their expectations are high but they do absolutely nothing to help .,,,Management Consultant,Current Employee,"Los Angeles, CA","November 29, 2022"
4.0,Good Benefits & Professional environment,"Benefits are good, salary is competitive for fresh grads, other extra rewards depends on the client you're in. There are lots of trainings available.
Some teams can be toxic. You are required to work for 9hrs a day but it's common to see people working overtime. Some tasks can be repetitive and might hinder career growth. You unfortunately can't choose what client you'll land on and the technologies you'll need to learn while working there.

Overall: Some experiences might be good, some might be bad. I could say that it all depends on the client/project you're in as each project have their own way of managing teams. Accenture as a whole is a good place to work. The benefits are very very appealing. There's also the opportunity to work in other countries.

2.0,"Toxic Work Environment, Zero Diversity and Work-Life Balance & Mediocre Management","Avoid Accenture if you want work-life balance, a healthy work environment, career progression based on your experience, skillset, dedication and loyalty. I have been here seven years and worked across various teams. I have never worked for a more disorganized and schizophrenic organization that overlooks and overworks top tier talent while promoting mediocrity.

Not sure how Accenture gets so many awards for Top Workplace or Diversity because it certainly does not live up to these values or aspirations once inside the company.

The “truly human” HR slogan is a farce. People who have dedicated their entire career and sacrificed their personal lives for this company are overworked and depleted and then treated like a pariah when they burn out or ask for help.

True leadership is aging out or leaving for better opportunities, pay and appreciation. Steer clear unless your goal is to be mediocre.",,,Marketing Manager,Former Employee,"Chicago, IL","November 20, 2022"

You can be work-oriented and focused on your role, or be casual and enjoy your work environment as you fulfill your tasks. Either way, you grow professionally and engage in any activities inside work that you can also do outside. In short, there is nothing ridiculous as long as it fosters growth and welfare of the employee. The only downside that you can think of is hopefully you could get assigned in a role that is related to your specialization even if you are a career shifter (e.g. medical background assigned in life science industry, engineering and manufacturing background assigned in utilities industry).",,,Associate Software Engineer,Current Employee,Mandaluyong,"October 21, 2022"

I was hired through accenture. Accenture is a great company but working with NM human services sucks. Never in my years of working have I ever seen a extreme level of micro management done. So much that it's sickening. They nit pick about everything and want you to fall in line like a robot. You get 30 minutes for lunch and 2 , 15 minute breaks out of a 8 hour shift . When you take 2 to 3 minutes in between to run to the bathroom they complain. They monitor your calls and time you and if your a minute over a 2 minute hold time They give you a bad score.

3.0,Team Dependent,"Ok to start your career if you’re coming from a coding bootcamp, college grads apply elsewhere. Low pay and compensation in the software engineering field. Accenture is a huge company with MANY different sectors so it really depends which sector/team you’re on. You may get a decent team with work life balance or a heavily micro managed team with a horrible one. As you get on the bench and get interviewed by other teams there you can’t really say no to whichever teams decides to pick you up despite what you may know about their reputation. Takes about a year before you can request to switch teams as well.

4.0,Good place to start,"Accenture is one of the best companies here in PH. Good benefits and trainings that will help you kickstart your career. Although, your mileage may vary depending on the project that you'll get assigned to.

Personally, I love the team but not the project. In my project, I feel like offshore employees are treated as 'disposables' which will be the first casualties when there are budget cuts (which happened multiple times in my stay). So even if you perform well, you'll still be in danger of being transferred to another scrum team or worse, rolled-off from the project if you didn't make that much of an impact. You also need to be braggy in order for you to become visible and get recognized. If you are the silent type then you are at a disadvantage here.

On the up side, Accenture has one of the best perks from what I hear. They also provide a lot of trainings but is subject to your supervisor's approval (which is affected by the project's budget and must not affect your deliverables). They also have free certifications that I suggest you take advantage of. And most of all - good people. I love my workmates here.",,,Software Engineer,Current Employee,Manila,"October 8, 2022"
1.0,Poor management and lack of growth opportunities,"I was at Accenture for a year and in that time I saw team leads with no experience or skill spend all their time trying to progress with their own career to the detriment of the teams they were leading. I saw good agents being overlooked for promotion in favour of less talented and less qualified individuals that spent their time brown nosing their bosses. I saw reports being fraudulently submitted to the clients stating results that were only achieved through the circumvention of quality processes. I saw favouritism for people who spoke portuguese and people who spoke English were alienated and dismissed. Overall the project I was a part of is merely using people until they are mentally worn out by the content they moderate and decide to leave, there is no room to grow and no mentors to help you with your career or goals and mental health issues are stigmatised.",,,Trust and Safety Analyst - Content Moderator,Former Employee,Lisboa,"October 8, 2022"

Apart from government-mandated benefits like SSS Calamity assistance,m/fire.flood and etc., benefits like these are also provided by the company. My colleagues are fun to be with. Ive considered them as my friends outside work and we hang out almost 5x a month. Work-life balance are highly encouraged in the team. We go diving with our Managers (CL7s), go camping, and eat out and etc. in terms of finances, Accenture offers different ways of saving money. We have ESPP which you can buy Accenture stocks with 15% discount per share. We also have SPF where you can save upto 25% of your base monthly pay. Next, ASLA. This is financial institution which Accenture has tapped the benefit of this is that you can save money how much you want and at the same time lend money with minimuummmm interest (legit).

And so many perks to enjoy too such as tie up with Abenson, Globe, Smart, Gym Clubs and etc.

- The project sometimes go astray by the programming language you wish to pursue, it's like constantly going at square one again.

- At some projects, Overtime was not paid but you have no choice to work since you must comply to the deadline of tasks. Although I think this not for the company to blame.

A day at office and culture.

Their managements lead by example. From the top manager 'P' to OM and TL, they show genuine care for their people. Very approachable and humble. I am touched, inspired, and humbled by them.

Of course, there is no perfect company...Their documents requirement and background check are excessively demanding and prying, they lack lockers for our bags, the need to carry our laptop with us daily, and their software tools have more than a few glitches with slow, cutting in-and-out internet connection. But their management is actively solving them. Making sure to fix them as soon as possible, and compensate in other areas like providing new monitors and lockers. Their tech support agents are quick to help too. So almost all issues are being solved fast.

I am thankful that it's God's will for me to be a part of this dream company even just for a seasonal, project-based account, which happens to be a toxic-free, interesting account, and with supportive trainers and quality auditors.

They don't let you take more than two weeks of vacation.
If you work overtime and stay awake to be paid double, forget it because they won't pay you.

Check your payments because they often paid you wrongly.

5.0,A company that you can truly move up in the hierarchy.,"I was extremely satisfied and honored to be a part of such an amazing enterprise. When needing to take Personal Leave of Absence due to circumstances preventing me the ability to get to work (atx) from SA. When putting yourself on personal leave you are well aware that your job is not secure but considering the amount of time I was moved from Team to team, not to mention the onboarding process took over 2-3 months, I was relieved of my role on day two of my personal leave. If I was given the chance to take care of my vehicle situation, I would have been right back to work and an asset to the company. I find it a bit unusual that I was contacted by my team lead about my role being replaced in such a short period of time, especially when I know they have been hiring and have needed people to fill these positions. I know the inner workings, and I'm more than capable of excelling at any position given to me if the opportunity were to present itself.

Management:
They will encourage growth in the role and will give you more tasks which can both be good and/or bad

Hardest part of the job:
- Usually they give people a lot of tasks more than one can handle(this one depends on the project/management), declining to take a task is frowned upon so expect a lot of judgement especially from colleagues

Most enjoyable part of the job:
- Working from home, my productivity and focus improved a lot

The system is horrific so everyone calling in has waited on hold listening to prompts for literally 20 minutes minimum, so no matter if they called in happy when they get to talk to you they are very mad. Management is horrible , the company feels like it's working against you at every turn. The hours are horrible and you will have no life outside answering angry calls.

2.0,"Decent wage, nice colleagues, work from home and flexible , bad communication , avoidable stress not being avoided lol","Nice people I work with, the work from home setup is handy and the wage is adequate for the work I am doing, the task at hand would be so easy if there was a dedicated POC for queries, the contract I am on should be so easy, no communication or clear instruction whenever you are stuck, left to rely on colleagues who are in the same boat.

Manager just pushes it off onto teammates, wouldn't mind, but the job would be so easy, takes 5 seconds to answer a question that would save hours of time and ambiguity on certain things, the workload piles on, then your asked why you haven't finished, and the stress throws me off focus. not happy here. and sent from pillar to post when you want someone to advise on a process.

Thus could be a me problem, well I know I am not the only one, high stress for something that seems so straightforward, limited instruction. but that's my experience, I don't want to leave, I feel this could be fixed so easily or once you know certain things you're golden, but stress outways all ATM",,,Financial Services Advisor,Current Employee,Dublin,"June 29, 2022"

4.0,decent company,"Accenture is an amazing company to work with.
1) Work-life balance - Now, it depends on what you look at when I say Work-life Balance. Are you looking for 9-6 job? Or you want to just work for 9 hours, or you have constraints due to other activities you do at home, like take care of new and old, have pets, you are the superwoman or superman of the house. Well, Accenture give you opportunity for all of the above. But, then you should be okay to see someone else going ahead or getting other opportunities, as they show more flexibility (Don't get me wrong here). What I mean to say is, Accenture supports all the above, but you need to discuss with your manager and see what works for you.
2) Stock option - Anyone can invest (even junior level). You get stocks purchased for a discounted price.
3) Diversity - Company respects diversity. I have seen this being both, a positive move and a negative move. Diversity brings in really good flavour to the team, and on contrary, it can be a reason for some resources to leave the organisation, as they missed opportunity to diversity.
(When Diversity is associated with numbers, it becomes reservation - My personal view)
4) Hike - I have seen many complain that hikes are not good. But I believe it depends on whether you are in the right skillset or not. At least, I have seen this company giving some hike compared to other company.
5) Variable payout frequency (Depending on your band) - Bonus is paid bi-annually. I would really consider any company to be awesome if they pay quarterly. But, this is also fine.
6) GYM and Medical facility - Each office",,,Frontend Development Associate,Current Employee,"Bengaluru, Karnataka","June 20, 2022"

5.0,Accenture best place to work,One can start career in this company. Apart from work one should know how to manage people. Management will listen to them who do bucketing to TL.

1.0,Lack of staff protections,"Accenture is a consulting company, which means they have big contracts and have quotas to fill. It's like an army. You will be put where you are needed.

Realigning your career is basically impossible at Accenture. At all levels of management, the incentive is to block good employees under them from moving. The loophole is to be useless, but not too useless that they fire you. The general feeling among all levels of staff therefore is one of being trapped. Now that bonuses have been removed, there is little incentive to perform. Salaries rise slower than industry standards, and don't if you do not excel.
The employee attrition rate is extreme. Within a year, most of your colleagues will have left. There remains only managers and grads. Those who stay for too long find it extremely difficult to find new work. Hence, the title of this review.

At the end of the day, the main reason people join a consulting company, is to be able to move around and experience different projects and roles. Accenture doesn’t offer this, pays worse, usually has worse roles, and expects you to do Accenture work on top of your client work. Join the client directly instead.

1.0,Regret not leaving sooner,"Accenture is a consulting company, which means they have big contracts and have quotas to fill. It's like an army. You will be put where you are needed.

Realigning your career is basically impossible at Accenture. At all levels of management, the incentive is to block good employees under them from moving.

Now that bonuses have been removed, there is little incentive to perform. Salaries rise slower than industry standards, and don't if you do not excel.

Equal pay for equal work is not a principal Accenture upholds.
You are aligned to a program when you join, and some are arbitrarily paid more than others. For example, it is common for two people to be in the same role doing the same work, but for one to be paid 8% more due to having a luckier alignment. Shifting alignment wipes your career progression since you are deemed to not have contributed to your new area.
The gender quotas are set extremely high, and other forms of virtue signalling are marketed hard. Compulsory voluntary service is also an Accenture staple.

Training is on the job and is sink or swim.

3.0,Great learning opportunities/poor career paths for experienced hires,"Accenture has much to offer in breadth - so much to learn especially new tech /digital, new innovative acquisitions. Leader selection has improved with stronger focus on people leadership. Biggest concern is leveling and career paths for experienced hires. Experienced hires with 15-20+ Vp/C-Level prior roles leveled with 6/7 yrs Accenture only experience is nonsensical. Should be a specific exp hire Role- L5 - with short path to MD or stay L5 as expert/TL, with a peer group cohort program focused to ramp gap skills quickly (with coaches) and intentionally so we gain the powerful value of real experience and credibility with Accenture skills quickly. 90% of tte leaders in my current leadership program are not happy and ready to leave. Secondly - our bonus plan is the worst I’ve seen anywhere - even banking. I was used to a minimum $50k bonus often close to $100k - here a $10-20 bonus is hard to come by for SMs. And deceptive info about the bonus in hiring. My new hire RSUs expire after this year and it doesn’t appear they extend them - my comp will take a big hit - of course I’ll leave. Tech replaces your RSUs as long as you perform and they let you know so you don’t leave. Lastly the health benefits /out of pocket cost is excessive - very expensive compared to tech and smaller consulting. We get away with this bc most talent doesn’t know any better - homegrown. I have met some great people here and learned a lot - but investment in IP is limited /we can’t compete on our methodologies/tools - it’s all ad hoc /offering development barely exists which makes delivering quality",,,"Senior Manager, T&O",Current Employee,"North East, PA","April 23, 2022"

2.0,Promises Made yet Undelivered,"Throughout my time at Accenture (just under a year) I was constantly and proactively told I would earn more, become full-time, have access to benefits, work within a business hours timeframe/schedule, etc.

I shifted to a new client/line or work internally as this was suggested to accelerate the above promises. I signed a new contract which at the time was presented as a full-time offer which was to become active in 6 months. This entailed benefits, a salary, PTO, the whole nine yards. This happened in September 2021.

Let’s fast forward to March 2022.

I’m told I am not to receive benefits as I’m an “on-call” employee, the full-time offer was really a contract extension that was misconstrued intentionally by management, the raise directly promised to me by a senior manager was no longer possible, my schedule had became even farther outside the bounds of standard business hours, etc.

I am not exaggerating when I say that 100% of promises made to myself went unfulfilled.

On top of this, middle management is disconnected and routinely sets bizarre goals (e.g. we were expected to handle 5 cases per hour, however, our inflow of work had slowed down due to over-hiring and general improvements in efficiency. This led to less than 5 cases being handled per hour. Management’s solution to this was increase our expected cases per hour to 7 despite or workload being the same as when 5 was too high of a target).

3.0,For a company that claims to be about the people they really don't follow that up in the role itself.,"I can't really recommend this. The systems never worked and they are very KPI driven.

After a devastating family incident occurred i was offered 2 days off and then was expected to return to the role and keep up with the ridiculous amount of KPIs. The campaign, ""Virgin media"" is run mostly from the Philippines and India but recently began a Newcastle office i'm assuming to support the March price rise that they are recently implementing.

The role was okay, in fairness despite the systems failing on a bi-hourly basis you could manage with it and most of the calls weren't terrible.

The main system they use however was kept out of the training (For whatever reason, it's literally one of their most important KPIs.) so you had to learn how to use this on the fly without any knowledge of how to use it.

They also use a DOS system that is clearly well over 20 years old which I think personally is unacceptable in 2022.

All in all i would not recommend this role to a friend, or in fact the company as a whole at this point due to the lack of empathy and overall disorganised nature of management. I realise this is something you see a lot on reviews but it is very apparent here that stats are way more important than your knowledge or ability as an agent.",,,Broadband Technical Support,Former Employee,Newcastle upon Tyne,"February 10, 2022"

4.0,Excellent place to start your career (especially out of college),"To keep it brief*, this is an excellent place to start your career out of college. Your first week in, you'll start with Agile training, learn the ropes, get basics on your role, and then be available to staff to a project. Depending on the length of the project, how long its been running, and the opportunities available, you'll be able to really succeed long-term in the company (+3 years).

In terms of how your career looks after 2-3 years, you'll need to make decisions, train for certifications, participate in volunteer extracurriculars and really grind to really make it worth something. I'm talking an extra 5-15 hours a week depending on how many people you'll want invested in your success. Also a great time to expand your network (starting at year 1, but really opening your contact list in year 2-3).

After about year 5, you'll need to reflect if you're interested in leadership or a high-demand technical role to acquire a competitve salary. If anything, at least your profile will be marketable to others outside of the company, especially with any security clearances, certifications, technical experience and any awards gathered along the way. If you decide to stay but aren't loving what you do daily, the grind can be intense and the demand can wear on your outlook. Otherwise, if you like working and/or a work-a-holic, you'll feel right at home.
