Chances are that you'll be reporting to someone in Buffalo, NY, Mettawa, IL, or Vancouver Canada.  Your team will probably be spread through these locations as well.  Therefore, your relationship with your manager(s) and colleagues can suffer.

Pay is OK.  It's not competitive but it's not the worst
Great colleagues
I can't think of anything else.","Hours and responsibilities have increased greatly for retail banking and wealth management division without any increase in pay or even a thank you.

The core problem with the bank is that they are behind in times in terms of technology and strategy.
Another problem is that the firm is extremely top heavy.  We have so many managers on top of managers that layers are 10 fold than what it used to be.

We were in a meeting and our head was saying our revenue is pale in comparison to our spending.  So what do they do? Cut tellers who are making 14-15 dollars/hour.  All I've thought about was why not trim the fat up top and create more transparency and save 100s of thousands of dollars? That's because layers are safer for the guys on top to protect their position.

From my understanding the heads run the bank by a spreadsheet.  It's similar to Marxist theory.  Works on paper but doesn't work in real life.

HSBC India - 
1. Working Culture - too good 
2. Work Life Balance - Awesome
3. COmpensation and Benefits - Always generous in benefits. But people with less salary always falls behind the curve.

932,3.0,This place is alright..a good place to start your career,"The number one reason for me is the opportunity to work with a diverse group of people. As you work with your colleague you'll get to know more about them and in turns get to embrace their backgroup. Also, depends on the job role you might get the opporutunity to work in many cross-functional projects, which allows you learn about what others are doing and it might even give you an opportunity to trasfer down the road and learn new skills set. The company is also big on gender inequality and they have a pretty good (3 months) maternity leave policy.","While HSBC is a strong international bank, its reputation in North America is pretty weak, especially on the West Coast . A lot of people still remember that HSBC was once the troubled Household bank and they want no part of it. Career advancement is pretty standard but it probably will help if you know your senior management pretty well. Once you become a manager though it's pretty hard to move up unless you are willing to pull extra 15-20 hours a week.

The office is especially nice with a great gym and break room equipped with pool, ping-pong, foosball and Direct TV satelitte on a 50 inch flat screen TV. I can't think of a better place to start your professional career. For a year I learned more than during four years in college.",The company as a whole is too big and cumbersome.

When things turned south the job became very unsatisfying.,There is a lot of talk as to how the loan options being offerred were benefitting the customers.  As interest rates in the sub prime market increased our ability to offer potential customers a reasonable loan option became very rare.  We ended up doing risky high interest rate loans to customers that would have a difficult time paying them back.  It became difficult to feel good about the job knowing that you were really not helping customers anymore.

Fellow employees are pretty friendly and easy to get along with.  There is not much cut throat competition.
HSBC offers special banking benefits to employees.","Promotions is biased. It is based on who brown noses the best and favoritism rather than on merit.  
A lot of the managers do not know anything about what they are managing thus making a big joke of everything and leaving everything for the analysts to figure out.
Some managers are strict about taking day offs.  Thus negating the purpose of having a lot of day offs.  It is stupid.. giving people a lot of day offs but not letting them take it when they want to or need it.

Systems do not sync with each other, and will waste a lot of your time copying and pasting information between different systems. Tech support is outsourced to India. And they generally give you a bad attitude when you call or for anything out of the ordinary. The systems will give you issues randomly, resulting in a call to tech support. This will take you about 1hr to 2 days to resolve. 
Management - VERY VERY micromanaged. Managers 2 levels above you will give you pressure. Everyday is a numbers game. My manager would throw numbers at you in the morning, ask how far along you are before you leave for lunch, then again before you leave. a Huge waste of time, and makes all employees miserable. Managers will blatantly tell you to disregard policy and procedure. The employee is then left in a tough situation. I once called banker support to see what they had to say about breaking this policy due to manager/branch discretion.

Those departments are far and few between these days, despite multiple rounds of culture training.",Consistent harassment and bullying are rampant.  For some reason those individuals continue to rise within departments and continues to foster a clique of favorites and create hostile work environments for those on the outside of their inner circle.  Continued harassment when brought up to superiors only results in the need for the victim to do more work to cover themselves and prevent any possibility for the harasser to complain.  This eventually leads to poor performance due to stress and work is delayed due to the additional levels of work to cover themselves and ability to obtain a collaborative work atmosphere.,Anonymous Employee,Current Employee,,"Mar 13, 2015"

Relatively aggressive about keeping up with modern technologies, providing opportunities to learn and do new things. As a Financial Services organization, there is lots of focus on controls, which has its benefits.

The culture is quite excellent in many ways, with pervasive messages about collaboration, inclusiveness, safety, and sustainability. There is a lot of focus on ""doing the right thing"", and it's such a broad and consistent message, with lots of support for things like whistleblowers, I do believe the messages are sincere. To be sure. HSBC has made headlines because of some very illegal things done by some of its employees. The company rightly is held responsible for this, but those actions don't seem to represent the company culture at large.","Because it's a Financial Services company, the focus on controls can mean the ship is large and slow to move, meaning a lot of the organization does focus on older, more staid processes and technology. For a number of years (5+) there has been significant organizational change as the bank tries to become more streamlined.

However, if you are working in the U.S., you are now an ""ugly step-child"" that headquarters is looking to save costs.  The former CEO was fired and a new CEO was sent from the U.K. to make cuts.

Here are some quick hits: 
• ""Tone at the top"" is lacking coherent strategy, planning and execution. This causes (1) management to run from one fire to the next; and (2) everyone to confuse activity for achievement
• Compliance is fundamentally unaware or out of touch with the line of businesses they support.  
• Technology/Data Integrity is poor. There is no attention to detail, no questioning of data integrity, causing people to accept what is put in front of them. 
 
As a result, work product is relatively poor and key deadlines are missed. In order to fix it, management hires more people to do the same tasks (thus no real value is being added) - much like govt agencies often do.

Yes, these are the pros compared to the cons.","Let me just state that the DPA of 2012 wasn't surprising given the far flung, year after year shenanigans at the bank; the feds velvet hammer triggered an internal shotgun response where a scalpel was/is needed.  In the past my response to 'where do you work?' was met with 'what's that?' Later some would say 'oh I had my mortgage with HSBC' (not happily I should add)....now, I respond by just saying 'computers' and leave it at that. I can not hear the word 'mistake' again without screaming. Oh the shame.

1341,2.0,Worst Customer Service Possible Internal and External,"HSBC is a great place to work if you are in a back office in Buffalo.  Your life is good, the cost of living is low, and saying you work at HSBC turns heads.  Your peers aren't high flyers, the unemployment rate in Western New York is sky high, but hey, you have a secure job...Chances are you are a legacy employee from one of the local regional banks HSBC bought to expand.
For everyone else, at least there is name recognition and HSBC's international reach does mean you can offer a suite of products other banks can only dream of offering.","If you work at HSBC in New York or DC its a pressure cooker.  People actually expect things out of a major International Bank, and they are in shock when they hit all the limitations HSBC has in the USA.  The systems are archaic, and many of your international customers will come with stories about how wonderful HSBC was in Hong Kong/Saudi Arabia/pick an emerging market HSBC actually cares about.  You are bound to disappoint them with HSBC USA.  
The terrible customer service isn't really the employee's fault.  The systems are primitive and middle management seem to think the way to fix it is adding additional layers of primitive manual systems.  (I suspect senior management has no idea this is the case)  This means doing things takes twice as long as at other banks, so folks are always overworked and pissy.  Add to that the lackadaisical attitude and terrible internal customer service and internal support you get from back offices in Buffalo and it makes for very unhappy Branch Personnel.  If you are lucky enough NOT to work at a branch, you are still stuck dealing with your clients' shock at how poorly they were treated at the branch.  Additionally, the Online Banking is awful as are Credit Cards and Mortgages.  Suffice to say I stopped using my HSBC Credit Card soon after arriving at the bank.",Assistant Vice President,Former Employe,"Washington, DC","Jan 22, 2011"
1342,2.0,"They're Laying Off Like Crazy in Buffalo, NY Right Now","When I worked hard and made extra efforts I was compensated for it (bonuses, raises)...but never promoted.  It's the luck of the draw though - depending on who your direct managers & supervisors are (see Cons below).","Well the main con is that they're laying off like crazy right now and probably won't be in Buffalo past 2013.  They got rid of 1500-2000 with the Capital One sale (this includes other sites around the country). And in the past two weeks about 200-500 more HSBC Buffalo employees have been laid off.  I  wouldn't be surprised if hundreds if not thousands more will be laid off by the end of this year due to the sale of the branches to First Niagara last weekend.  On to other cons...HSBC likes to move uneducated management around within the company - managers from one dept to another who have no clue about their new dept. and also promote people who have no college and/or don't have enough experience of the job.  Why do they do this?  Because then they don't have to pay what the job is worth, because that would require hiring someone with a degree and/or previous management experience in that field who would require a lot more money.  When management doesn't have a clue about the job, it trickles down and makes everyone's lives miserable.  (see 'Advice to Management' for a continuation of this).

There is a generous bonus, when we are in a recession.
Salaried people just don't get fired.
You have the freedom to make what you want out of your position.","Promoting from within based on relationships has put unqualitied people at the helm of many groups. This leads to slow, inefficient pockets of non-professionals. The resulting chaos and flailing about towards goals is inevitable. 
There is a cover-your-vulnerability culture, where the biggest concern is to avoid blame. This mind-set is so entrenched that managers are reluctant to hold other groups accountable when their processes or products are faulty.
When you combine everyone's desire to avoid being blamed and their consequential aversion to blaming anyone, you end up with no accountability. Systems crash, processes fail and pesonnel exhibit incompatence without resulting in any communication, awareness of the event or change.
Both System deficiencies and network issues that cause burdens to end users are simply endured. It seems like any improvements or added functionality is at the whim of the departent supporting it.

There is another cultural anomaly that was particulrly difficult to becoem accustomed to, and which is more difficult to accept. You will hear the words, ""I'm sorry, I was multitasking. What did you need?"", at least once in every conference call. It is culturally acceptible to just listen for your name and tune out the rest. There is a deplorable lack of interest in efficient and effective communicaion.

Senior managers have good intentions and an earnest desire to meet their goals and objectives, but without a framework for cross-departmental accountability, without the leadership of policy makers, with a tendency to call for consensus rather than lead a group, they are left flailing toward their objectives, waiting for someone on the team to step up and make it happen, practically on their own.

It seems like there are key individuals at al levels within the organization who have a reputation for dependability and professionaism, and these people are called upon in every project because they are responsive and dependable and competent. But there is burn out, and their personalities show it.

Over-all, this is a good place for someone who just wants to get along, unnoticed by most, and collect a pensionfrom a reliable banking business. This is also a god place for the politically minded, who enjoy developing relationships within management without producint anything or being productive within the business itself. However, if you are motivated, if you pursue excellence, if you value professionalism and have high expectations from yourself as well as others, this place will drive you crazy and turn your demeanor into a pessemistic, grumpy critic of all those around you and the company itself. After one to two years, you will be looking for a way out.",,Current Employe,"Tigard, OR","Jun 29, 2010"

1405,1.0,The ship is sinking...,"Relaxed atmosphere, good bonuses, lots of overtime available, not open 24/7, cafeteria, clean, ample parking, good location, nice lobby, security.","I was hired as a collections rep II.  From what was blatantly said by senior management HSBC is liquidating their mortgage portfolios and there are no plans to generate new ones.  They have been fined for regulation violations (predatory lending) and are looking to sell the portfolio altogether.  This has already been done w/ their credit card portfolio.  The time frame given 'long term' was three years, so don't plan on being there long.  I believe HSBC is a wonderful company to be employed with, if you are in a higher up position.  For  collections and customer service they're simply hiring bodies at this point to help liquidate the portfolio before it is sold.  This has led to very lax employment requirements, in my training class I witnessed racial slurs ""that's just one more white person I can check off my list, I don't like them anyway"", obscenities, markers and such being thrown, passing gas loudly and purposely in the elevator, and sexual comments as well.  I believe there would be less disorder in a prison yard.  The employees who have been there for a while seem to be equally disgusted in the new-hire classes.  One last thing, the dress code is neither interpreted or enforced, much of the time I felt as if I was in a club; abundances of cleavage, spandex, six inch platform heels, bamboo earrings, bright orange hair, tattoos,etc. (see posted pic).  If you are at all looking for a job that utilizes skills or education go elsewhere.  If you're looking to get in and out and make some fast money in the next couple years then this would be a good place for you (the job itself isn't that bad if you can make it through the god-awful subjugation of the training class).",Collections Representative II,Current Employee,"Brandon, FL","Sep 24, 2012"

This is a big organization and that comes with it's own issues, but I have worked at a number of big banks that did not have these problems and to the degree HSBC Compliance (in the US) does. 

Here are some quick hits: 
• ""Tone at the top"" is lacking coherent strategy, planning and execution. This causes (1) management to run from one fire to the next; and (2) everyone to confuse activity for achievement
• Compliance is fundamentally unaware or out of touch with the line of businesses they support.  
• Technology/Data Integrity is poor. There is no attention to detail, no questioning of data integrity, causing people to accept what is put in front of them. 
 
As a result, work product is relatively poor and key deadlines are missed. In order to fix it, management hires more people to do the same tasks (thus no real value is being added) - much like govt agencies often do. Consequently, they rely HEAVILY on contractors and junior level personnel to complete all tasks. As you can imagine, this causes contractors and jr. level people to quit more often.",Compliance,Former Employee,"New York, NY","Dec 17, 2017"
