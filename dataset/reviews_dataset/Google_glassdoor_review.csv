0,5.0,Great place to work,It was really great to work for a place that actually cared about its employees. I would have stayed but I had some personal issues that prevented me from working. I really liked that I could work from home.,No downsides to working there.,Customer Engineer,Former Employee,"Los Angeles, CA","Mar 25, 2023"
1,4.0,"Moving at the speed of light, burn out is inevitable","1) Food, food, food.  15+ cafes on main campus (MTV) alone.  Mini-kitchens, snacks, drinks, free breakfast/lunch/dinner, all day, errr'day.

2) Benefits/perks.  Free 24:7 gym access (on MTV campus).  Free (self service) laundry (washer/dryer) available.  Bowling alley.  Volley ball pit.  Custom-built and exclusive employee use only outdoor sport park (MTV).  Free health/fitness assessments.  Dog-friendly.  Etc. etc. etc.

3) Compensation.  In ~2010 or 2011, Google updated its compensation packages so that they were more competitive.  

4) For the size of the organization (30K+), it has remained relatively innovative, nimble, and fast-paced and open with communication but, that is definitely changing (for the worse).

5) With so many departments, focus areas, and products, *in theory*, you should have plenty of opportunity to grow your career (horizontally or vertically).  In practice, not true.  

6)  You get to work with some of the brightest, most innovative and hard-working/diligent minds in the industry.  There's a ""con"" to that, too (see below).","1) Work/life balance.  What balance?  All those perks and benefits are an illusion.  They keep you at work and they help you to be more productive.  I've never met anybody at Google who actually time off on weekends or on vacations.  You may not hear management say, ""You have to work on weekends/vacations"" but, they set the culture by doing so - and it inevitably trickles down.  I don't know if Google inadvertently hires the work-a-holics or if they create work-a-holics in us.  Regardless, I have seen way too many of the following: marriages fall apart, colleagues choosing work and projects over family, colleagues getting physically sick and ill because of stress, colleagues crying while at work because of the stress, colleagues shooting out emails at midnight, 1am, 2am, 3am.  It is absolutely ridiculous and something needs to change.

2) Poor management.  I think the issue is that, a majority of people love Google because they get to work on interesting technical problems - and these are the people that see little value in learning how to develop emotional intelligence.  Perhaps they enjoy technical problems because people are too ""difficult.""  People are promoted into management positions - not because they actually know how to lead/manage, but because they happen to be smart or because there is no other path to grow into.  So there is a layer of intelligent individuals who are horrible managers and leaders.  Yet, there is no value system to actually do anything about that because ""emotional intelligence"" or ""adaptive leadership"" are not taken seriously.

3) Jerks.  Sure, there are a lot of brilliant people - but, sadly, there are also a lot of jerks (and, many times, they are one and the same).  Years ago, that wasn't the case.  I don't know if the pool of candidates is getting smaller, or maybe all the folks with great personalities cashed out and left, or maybe people are getting burned out and it's wearing on their personality and patience.  I've heard stories of managers straight-up cussing out their employees and intimidating/scaring their employees into compliance.

4) It's a giant company now and, inevitably, it has become slower moving and is now layered with process and bureaucracy.  So many political battles, empire building, territory grabbing.  Google says, ""Don't be evil.""  But, that practice doesn't seem to be put into place when it comes to internal practices.  :(",Program Manager,Former Employee,"Mountain View, CA","Jun 21, 2013"
2,5.0,"Great balance between big-company security and fun, fast-moving projects","* If you're a software engineer, you're among the kings of the hill at Google. It's an engineer-driven company without a doubt (that *is* changing, but it's still very engineer-focused).
* The perks are amazing. Yes, free breakfast, lunch, an dinner every weekday. Aaaaaamazing holiday parties (at Waldorf Astoria, NY Public Library, MoMA, etc.); overnight ski trips to Vermont; overnight nature trips to the Poconos in the summer; summer picnics at Chelsea piers; and on and on and on. I don't see this going away unless the company starts hurting financially.
* Speaking of which, the company is doing quite well, which reflects in bonuses and equity grants.
* There a huge diversity of work ranging from defending independent journalism worldwide (Google Project Shield) to crisis response during disasters (see Maps during Hurricane Sandy or Tsunamis), to the best machine learning experts and projects in the world, to more mundane revenue-driving projects in advertising, there's really something for everybody.
* It's easy to move around within the company as long as you're in good standing (the vast majority of engineers are).
* The company is amazingly open: every week Larry Page and Sergey Brin host what's called TGIF where food, beer, wine, etc. is served, a new project is presented, and afterward there's an open forum to ask the executives anything you want. It's truly fair game to ask anything, no matter how controversial, and frequently the executives will be responsive.
* No, nobody cares if you use an iPhone, Facebook, shop with Amazon, stream using Spotify, or refuse to use Google+. The company is amazingly open and flexible.

Neither pro nor con, but general information on work-life balance, promotions, and advancement.
* Work life balance can be what you want it to be on most teams. (Some teams are in more competitive sectors and require more crazy hours all the time - but very few of them). If you do what's expected, you'll be fine at least for a handful of years. Working a roughly 40 hour work week is possible, and many people do it. There are also people who are hyper-motived and work like crazy just because they love it, or because they're competitive, or they want to get a promotion. If you work 40 hour weeks without putting in anything extra, you'll fall behind them as they advance and you stand still - and maybe that doesn't matter, so it works out for everybody. But at least know where you would realistically stand.
* If you excel and work your butt off, you'll be compensated and promoted. If you let yourself be a code monkey, and just sit coding with your head down all day, you'll be fine but won't advance. A big complaint from some Googlers is about not being able to advance ""even at Google"" with pure coding. Sure, if you're the uber genius who created MapReduce and Bigtable, you're going to advance like a rocket without having to do anything but coding; but if you're like most engineers at Google -- smarter than average, but just average compared to other Googlers -- you're just a good coder and not revolutionary. Code monkeys are important to actually get stuff done, and to be sure you absolutely need to be a good coder as a software engineer (it's the minimum requirement), but code monkeys won't advance because they're not leaders and they're easy to replace. To get promoted you need to lead and do more than just code. There are plenty of ways to lead other than being an official tech lead, so this isn't actually _that_ hard, so the real point is just that you can't just sit there coding what other people tell you to code all day and expect to advance.","* It *is* becoming larger, and with it comes growing pains: bureaucracy, slow to respond to market threats, bloated teams, cross-divisional tension (though nothing remotely approaching that of Microsoft's internal tension).
* The quality of the engineers is possibly dropping, but possibly not. It's hard to get real metrics, because as the absolute number of people grows, naturally the number of bad apples grows; as a percentage it's supposedly the same as it ever was, but with larger numbers of poorer quality engineers it just _feels_ like things might be changing for the worse.
* Also with growth means more internal-confidential data leaks (again, because of the raw numbers of people) -- product announcements being ruined, etc. That means the company has to be tighter-lipped internally to avoid leaks, which makes things less open. It's still an amazingly open place, but less so than it was even a couple years ago. The good thing is they recognize it and actively look to improve things because they know how important it is to keep the good culture.",Software Engineer III,Current Employee,"New York, NY","May 10, 2014"
3,5.0,The best place I've worked and also the most demanding.,"You can't find a more well-regarded company that actually deserves the hype it gets.

You'll work on cutting edge projects / solve important issues that impact your community and the world

You'll meet interesting people who are your colleagues, managers, and senior management.

You'll open the paper and see your company in the news almost every day, and read about projects you're working on, which is a cool thing

You'll see Larry and Sergey at TGIF and you'll admire how they lead the company. They are brilliant, goofy, low key but intense, and likeable. 

There are 22 cafes (more or less), the food is excellent, and it's free.

Your pay will typically be competitive, though it needs to be tweaked up a bit since the economy has improved.

Google cares about how it treats its employees.

The campus is like an academic campus in many ways.

There are tons of activities on campus, like authors speaking about their books, films after work, and gyms where you can work out - but you'll need to make sure to carve out time to do these things.

You'll get plenty of external validation from people who suddenly think you're smart and rich because you work there, even if you're not rich and you're as smart when you didn't work at Google.

If and when you leave, you'll never regret having that company on your resume. It opens doors. 

The company is flexible - if you're lucky, you won't have a micromanager boss and you can be somewhat flexible in how you work - but don't get me wrong - you'll work a LOT. But you don't have to do all of it chained to your desk.","I live in SF so the commute can take between 1.5 hours to 1.75 hours each way on the shuttle - sometimes 2 hours each way on a busy day or rainy day. That means being on the bus for 3-4 hours PER DAY. It's a wired bus though which means you can work on the way to Mountain View. But it can feel brutal.

Your first year or two are really important in terms of your career at Google and they affect how you're viewed, and your ability to be promoted. You should always ask to work on high profile projects. If you don't get them, don't expect to get high ratings or get promoted. Always volunteer for cross functional group work for maximum exposure, and then work hard at those things.

You'll likely work on something that no one will explain to you and it will take you at least a year to be comfortable doing what you're working on, even if you're super quick at learning.  No one has time to train you or teach you what you're doing - which is kind of hard.

After two or three years, people you started out with at Google start to get promoted. If you're not one of them, you'll wonder why and how it happened, and that process is somewhat political and not always clear. 

It's a big company now. And super political. So don't be naive. Expect some people to be catty, some people to be territorial, and be prepared to be mentally tough. Don't let people see your vulnerableness. It's a Darwinistic culture with a huge dose of 30-something idealism on top which can fool you into thinking that people are easygoing - they're not. They're driven. If you're not driven, you're not going to fit in.

When you start at Google, it seems like peer reviews are super important - they are, but they are the sprinkles on the fro yo. The important thing is that your direct manager knows your work, likes your work and likes you, and then you can get promoted. If your boss doesn't like you, all the positive peer reviews in the world won't help you.  Make sure you know what your boss wants, and give it to them. You will have weekly one on ones, and make sure you are addressing your performance at each one, asking if they have questions, how you can improve, can you work on cross functional projects, etc.

It's really hard to find work life balance at Google. The workload is huge.   I hardly have time to work out. The commute is brutal. My family sometimes needs more from me and I can't give it. I'm still trying to find the balance. I think I need more down time than most people so I have a hard time being structured every day to fit all the things I want into my day, so a lot of things slip, like working out.",,Current Employe,"Mountain View, CA","Feb 8, 2015"
4,3.0,WAS a great place to work...things have drastically changed,"Original pros: invested leadership, open transparent culture, amenities, energy and vibrancy, buzz in the office, great people in my org, top notch pay and benefits","Since about 2015...the above has steadily declined. Last year was terrible. What used to be a company of open culture & communication is no longer the case. The company operates full of bureaucracy & hidden agendas, there is no longer a true north star and Google no longer has the employee's best interest at heart. Because of this, the culture was damaged, when Google's culture is its most important resource.",Executive Business Partner,Former Employee,,"Mar 25, 2023"
5,3.0,Good,"Reputation: Google is known for being one of the most innovative and successful companies in the world. Working for such a well-regarded company can boost your professional reputation and provide valuable experience. Compensation: Google offers competitive salaries and benefits to its employees, including stock options, health insurance, and retirement plans. Perks: Google is famous for providing its employees with numerous perks, such as free meals, snacks, on-site gyms, and shuttle services. These perks can make the work environment more enjoyable and comfortable. Culture: Google is known for having a unique and progressive work culture that values innovation, collaboration, and diversity. Many employees appreciate this type of environment and find it motivating. Learning Opportunities: Google provides opportunities for employees to continue their education and professional development. This includes access to courses, conferences, and other resources.","High Expectations: Google is a highly competitive and demanding company, and employees are expected to perform at a high level. This can lead to stress and burnout for some workers. Work-Life Balance: The fast-paced and demanding work environment at Google can make it difficult to maintain a healthy work-life balance. Some employees report working long hours and having trouble disconnecting from work. Bureaucracy: As with any large company, Google has a certain level of bureaucracy and red tape that can slow down decision-making and make it difficult to get things done. Limited Autonomy: While Google encourages creativity and innovation, some employees may feel constrained by the company's rigid structures and protocols. Competitive Environment: The competitive nature of the company can sometimes create tension and competition among employees, which can lead to a negative work environment.",Product Manager,Current Employe,"Menlo, GA","Mar 17, 2023"
6,3.0,Fall of a great company culture,"I've been at Google a long time, so the financial benefits still outweigh any cons. The people I work with are still mostly great, especially most of my management chain (though one or two are no-ops).","The company was founded on psychological safety, don't be evil, hire smart creatives, etc.. Today, the company has grown so fast and so large that now the majority of people seem to be typical tech industry employees. That means most of the management has now come from outside the company, so that has killed the culture. Psychological safety is gone, especially after the way the layoffs were handled. I miss Laszlo Bock; he knew how to treat the workforce. I miss Larry, Sergey, and Eric. The general quality of my peers has gone down. Not as people, they're all lovely, but as practitioners. Most of them do what we'd have considered low-quality work 5 years ago. It's shockingly bad, really, by comparison. They've all been hired so fast and in such an environment where they weren't properly trained or didn't have the proper background to begin with or haven't been given the time and mentorship required to become great (investing in people).",Android Engineer,Current Employee,"Seattle, WA","Feb 25, 2023"
7,4.0,"Morale has taken a hit, but the work and people are still great","The best part of working at Google has always been the people and the culture. I get to work with very smart, hard-working, and dependable people. My teammates are great. The part of my management chain I know and talk to are good at setting technical direction and treat their people with kindness. I also am fortunate to work on fun technical challenges (this isn't the case in all of Google)","The recent layoffs were handled very poorly. Performance played almost no factor, meaning that we are left feeling like it doesn't matter how productive we are or how good we are at collaborating and helping others. The recent news that Cloud is doing hot-desking and desk sharing seems absurd for a company as wealthy as Google and which depends so heavily on its employees. The announcement presentation of Bard was a debacle; how do we not make sure we have a backup phone for a demo like that? It was disheartening to see from the level of employees ""on the ground"", where we work very hard to have redundancy for important things and do our jobs as well as we can.",Senior Software Engineer,Current Employee,"Boulder, CO","Feb 25, 2023"
8,4.0,Great company with some room for improvement,"I've been a data analyst at Google for a while, and I must say, I really like what I do. The working environment is cozy and welcoming on-site, to start with. With lots of natural light and pleasant working areas, the workplace is well-designed and cozy. In addition, cafeterias and micro kitchens serve delicious meals! It's wonderful to have access to wholesome and delectable meals all day long. The ability to work from home a couple of days a week is another major benefit. This is fantastic for days when I need to concentrate on specific tasks or simply want a change of environment. In terms of work-life balance, the employer is also generally supportive, which is a significant positive.","There are many meetings, which is one drawback of working here. I sometimes feel like I work on my tasks less and spend more time in meetings. There may also be a ton of work to complete, which can occasionally be overwhelming. Even with the support of the team, it may be difficult to maintain a healthy work-life balance as a result. In conclusion, I would suggest Google to anyone looking to work as a data analyst.

11,3.0,Pros and Cons as with anything,"- Having a good experience at Google depends largely on your team and I had a great team that I was sad to leave. - Good severance when laid off - Amazing benefits while employed, would have made it difficult to leave the company by choice despite being unhappy with a lot of aspects of the work","Role-specific: - Very bureaucratic + lots of red tape when it comes to hiring. As a result, hiring process takes minimum 3 months (usually closer to 4/5 months) for a req to close and the recruiter really can't control this timing much. This makes it hard to keep candidates happy and difficult to meet quarterly goals since making each hire often takes longer than a quarter. - Some hiring managers can be tough to work or exhibit an elitist attitude; hard to convince some to follow inclusive hiring steps since they will have such a clear idea of the ""type"" of candidate they want. In general: - You really are just a number while working at Google. It's possible to build strong relationships and not feel this during the day to day, but leadership makes it clear. Examples: Lay off method was cold and not based on employee impact or performance. Leadership will remove benefits without warning, such as being able to work remotely. - Upward and internal mobility is extremely difficult. Promos take years and applying for internal roles is very competitive, so make sure you're prepared to stay in the role you're hired into for 3-4 years before even being looked at for mobility.",Recruiter,Former Employee,,"Feb 3, 2023"

Leaders: we do not have real leaders, we have people who in the earliest and least experienced parts of their career were lucky enough to land at Google and never left. Our CEO is not a business leader by training. Our CMO has had her job for over 20 years (red flag). Our CPO is MIA because we operate in such silos. Career: Join Google if you want to be severely under-leveled, have your experience minimized, be patronizingly led by people less qualified and less experienced than you, and have near zero prospects for upward mobility. Future: This company has no strategy. All you have to do is follow the news to see Google as a company woefully out of touch with the rest of the world. We have no clue how to do marketing, which is obvious from Bard to the graveyard of things we've killed off.

In fact, I think Google finally made the right decision after it made a series of bad decisions. The bad decisions came from management who decided to expand the workforce vigorously during the COVID bubble and those who had an unclear vision of what products to build. Unfortunately, most people who paid the price for these bad decisions aren't the ones who made them. If you were like me who believed that Google is a great company that takes care of its employees, think again.

You have to do more work than is necessary to get people hired. There are about 10 steps it takes and around 2 - 3 months to get anyone hired.

85,4.0,Good Place to work - way behind AWS in market adoption,"People were impressed when I said I worked at Google - my mom told me she was proud me (LOL - I'm in my 50s). Office benefits were great at the time (before the 'rona) . Our office was a smaller office but breakfast and lunch were provided as were drinks and snacks. We also had 'mental health days' and some groups and 'no meeting weeks'. The no meeting weeks were stupid to be honest. Some office has a masseuse that you could schedule. Getting meetings with senior exec was easy, people are interested in what Google has to say or is doing. I never has such and easy time getting to senior staff. Google Cloud is impressive and is just a secure & robust (if not more so) as any other cloud. Google is also a cash printing machine so while I was there it there wasn't any cost cutting or anything like that. I really came to appreciate Google tools & productivity suite - they really work well. Salary & Benefits are very good, stock options were phenomenal.",The cons are a few but notable. First I would say that there was a big cultural transformation when I joined. Google was hiring a lot of enterprise sales & business leaders and many of the existing Googlers were vocally uncomfortable with it. Their bubble was being burst. Also Google had what I describe as a naive arrogance to itself. The attitude was 'our cloud is so good you'd be foolish not to use it and consume resources the way we think you should'. This lead to being several years behind AWS & Azure in the public sector market. I could go into great detail but suffice to say that Google is not the center of the cloud universe. This lead to being years behind AWS and sales were almost non-existant while I was there. Most of the people that joined when I did have moved on. At the time the comp plan only paid us on committed spend contracts which was an extra step in adoption and difficult to negotiate. Google tries to insert itself into national political discussion but comes off as hypocritical - probably best to avoid.,Sales Representative,Former Employee,"Washington, DC","Mar 1, 2023"

The company acted under the at-will law but the trade off of bumping up shareholder value at the expense of vulnerable people is something I now consider the purest corporate evil I’ve ever seen. Cutting off the corporate access in the middle of the night was demoralizing, degrading and demeaning like all 12K people were criminals.

All of the bizarre headlines published about Google to the outside world are just as baffling to the majority of employees inside the company.

Benefits and perks have been dramatically slashed, thousands of employees are fired without notice, culture-building events such as hackathons, knowledge-sharing social events, family events and holiday parties are all pretty much gone. Travel is mostly non-existent, except for executives and product VPs.

The company no longer appears to have any vision about being competitive in the future, and has gone all-in on a cost-cutting strategy to survive. C-level executives regularly respond in corporate double-speak about how they're ""taking responsibility"", while dodging questions that are critical of them or their decisions during TGIF (the company wide all-hands) and Town-Hall meetings. They continue to collect record-setting equity payouts, ignore critical feedback about company decisions and strategy, and have turned a blind eye to plummeting moral which is at an all-time 24yr low.

Some grass-roots efforts inside the company have even being to sprout in an effort to stop the bleeding and affect some sort of positive change, but these efforts are mostly hampered by the lack of transparency and the willingness of leadership to terminate employees without notice and for sketchy or ambiguous cause.

Confidence in leadership (all the way up to Sundar) is in an abysmal state, and there is no clear idea about how to make the company successful in the future. The luster of the roles it offers is quickly dissolving, and unless something incredibly dramatic happens at the leadership level, I wouldn't not expect Google to be an innovation leader in anything, within the next couple of years.",User Experience Engineer,Current Employee,"Boulder, CO","Mar 1, 2023"

In fact, I think Google finally made the right decision after it made a series of bad decisions. The bad decisions came from management who decided to expand the workforce vigorously during the COVID bubble and those who had an unclear vision of what products to build. Unfortunately, most people who paid the price for these bad decisions aren't the ones who made them.

178,4.0,Good Place to work - way behind AWS in market adoption,"People were impressed when I said I worked at Google - my mom told me she was proud me (LOL - I'm in my 50s). Office benefits were great at the time (before the 'rona) . Our office was a smaller office but breakfast and lunch were provided as were drinks and snacks. We also had 'mental health days' and some groups and 'no meeting weeks'. The no meeting weeks were stupid to be honest. Some office has a masseuse that you could schedule. Getting meetings with senior exec was easy, people are interested in what Google has to say or is doing. I never has such and easy time getting to senior staff. Google Cloud is impressive and is just a secure & robust (if not more so) as any other cloud. Google is also a cash printing machine so while I was there it there wasn't any cost cutting or anything like that. I really came to appreciate Google tools & productivity suite - they really work well. Salary & Benefits are very good, stock options were phenomenal.",The cons are a few but notable. First I would say that there was a big cultural transformation when I joined. Google was hiring a lot of enterprise sales & business leaders and many of the existing Googlers were vocally uncomfortable with it. Their bubble was being burst. Also Google had what I describe as a naive arrogance to itself. The attitude was 'our cloud is so good you'd be foolish not to use it and consume resources the way we think you should'. This lead to being several years behind AWS & Azure in the public sector market. I could go into great detail but suffice to say that Google is not the center of the cloud universe. This lead to being years behind AWS and sales were almost non-existant while I was there. Most of the people that joined when I did have moved on. At the time the comp plan only paid us on committed spend contracts which was an extra step in adoption and difficult to negotiate. Google tries to insert itself into national political discussion but comes off as hypocritical - probably best to avoid.,Sales Representative,Former Employee,"Washington, DC","Mar 1, 2023"

* The work is generally challenging - solving difficult problems at scale - but not super intense. Rarely have to work longer than 40 hours/week if you are good at setting your expectations. 

* Anyone who has been there since the mid 2010s or longer is likely to be a super smart, super kind person who is competent and a pleasure to work with.","* It increasingly feels like other big tech companies. The bottom-up, dev-focused mentality still exists to some extent, but bureaucracy, mandates, and managerial office politics are all getting more prevalent. Leadership decisions are increasingly opaque and crassly unconcerned with employee opinions. 

* Hiring standards have plummeted with the rapid expansion starting in the late 2010s. Combined with the widely available materials and coaching for passing Google interviews, this has led to a lot more incompetent people getting into the company at all levels. 

* The company is agonizingly slow to fire people for performance reasons. This means if you have teammates, reports, or (the worse) managers who are incompetent, they could linger in their positions for a year or years being minimally productive -  or even actively counterproductive - before they are let go. 

* You'd often think the company was struggling to make ends meet, rather than profiting tens of billions of dollars per year.

With the new GRAD ratings, it's effectively impossible to change teams, as you only get one rating for an entire year, based on which team you were on the longest.

Recent changes both internal and external have been disruptive and thrown this system out of equilibrium. This has impacted the psychological safety of its 180K employees. Team health issues are common and toxic situations can arise regularly. This arises from a combination of high expectations, intelligent people, and an aversion to risk/failure.

Google is now run by the CFO, essentially, and there are several dozen senior leaders at Google that all act and behave like a CEO, but don't coordinate with each other.

- Some projects can involve working on very cool technology (as long as there's a clear plan to generate revenue, otherwise it gets axed).","Leadership is short-sighted, tone-deaf, and useless. All of the bizarre headlines published about Google to the outside world are just as baffling to the majority of employees inside the company.

Benefits and perks have been dramatically slashed, thousands of employees are fired without notice, culture-building events such as hackathons, knowledge-sharing social events, family events and holiday parties are all pretty much gone. Travel is mostly non-existent, except for executives and product VPs.

The company no longer appears to have any vision about being competitive in the future, and has gone all-in on a cost-cutting strategy to survive. C-level executives regularly respond in corporate double-speak about how they're ""taking responsibility"", while dodging questions that are critical of them or their decisions during TGIF (the company wide all-hands) and Town-Hall meetings. They continue to collect record-setting equity payouts, ignore critical feedback about company decisions and strategy, and have turned a blind eye to plummeting moral which is at an all-time 24yr low.

Some grass-roots efforts inside the company have even being to sprout in an effort to stop the bleeding and affect some sort of positive change, but these efforts are mostly hampered by the lack of transparency and the willingness of leadership to terminate employees without notice and for sketchy or ambiguous cause.

Confidence in leadership (all the way up to Sundar) is in an abysmal state, and there is no clear idea about how to make the company successful in the future. The luster of the roles it offers is quickly dissolving, and unless something incredibly dramatic happens at the leadership level, I wouldn't not expect Google to be an innovation leader in anything, within the next couple of years.",User Experience Engineer,Current Employee,"Boulder, CO","Mar 1, 2023"

You can remove all the low-level managers, and nothing would change. - Sometimes, very toxic culture. I'm in the workforce for 20+ years.

I'm in an external, client-facing role yet spend more time managing internal expectations than external ones. Things like tracking meetings (we have a meeting quota), tracking pitches, attending internal meetings, working on the aforementioned perf process. - Hustle culture to the extreme.

* Google still has most of the perks it's famous for. Solid food, entertainment options, gyms, interesting shared spaces. 

* The work is generally challenging - solving difficult problems at scale - but not super intense. Rarely have to work longer than 40 hours/week if you are good at setting your expectations. 

* Anyone who has been there since the mid 2010s or longer is likely to be a super smart, super kind person who is competent and a pleasure to work with.","* It increasingly feels like other big tech companies. The bottom-up, dev-focused mentality still exists to some extent, but bureaucracy, mandates, and managerial office politics are all getting more prevalent. Leadership decisions are increasingly opaque and crassly unconcerned with employee opinions. 

* Hiring standards have plummeted with the rapid expansion starting in the late 2010s. Combined with the widely available materials and coaching for passing Google interviews, this has led to a lot more incompetent people getting into the company at all levels. 

* The company is agonizingly slow to fire people for performance reasons. This means if you have teammates, reports, or (the worse) managers who are incompetent, they could linger in their positions for a year or years being minimally productive -  or even actively counterproductive - before they are let go. 

* You'd often think the company was struggling to make ends meet, rather than profiting tens of billions of dollars per year. Perks are being suspended or cut, mass layoffs occurred without warning, and the already haphazard hiring pipeline has been frozen on and off.

One of the things that stood out to me during my time at Google was the level of expertise and knowledge of my colleagues. I had the opportunity to work with some of the brightest minds in the industry and it was truly inspiring. The mentorship and guidance provided by my team leaders helped me to grow both personally and professionally. The company is also very forward-thinking when it comes to technology and is always pushing the boundaries of what is possible. It was exciting to be a part of such a dynamic and innovative organization. In terms of work-life balance, Google does a great job of promoting a healthy balance. The company encourages employees to take the time they need to recharge and focus on their well-being. Overall, my experience at Google was extremely positive and I feel grateful for the opportunity to have been a part of such an incredible organization. I highly recommend the company to anyone looking for a challenging, rewarding, and innovative work experience.","It is worth noting that working at Google can also have its downsides. The company is known for its fast-paced and high-pressure environment, which can be stressful at times. Additionally, the company's size and bureaucracy can make it difficult to navigate and get things done. It may also be difficult to get noticed or promoted within the company due to the sheer number of employees and the high level of competition. Another con could be the cost of living in the area where the office is located, it could be very high, which can be a challenge for some employees. It is also worth noting that the company's policies and practices have come under scrutiny in recent years, particularly in regards to issues such as privacy and censorship. While Google is committed to making positive changes in these areas, it is important to be aware of these issues and how they may impact your experience at the company.",Sodftware Engineer,Current Employee,"Atlanta, GA","Jan 16, 2023"

Google is now run by the CFO, essentially, and there are several dozen senior leaders at Google that all act and behave like a CEO, but don't coordinate with each other.

The work environment is fast-paced and challenging, but also incredibly rewarding. One of the things that stood out to me during my time at Google was the level of expertise and knowledge of my colleagues. I had the opportunity to work with some of the brightest minds in the industry and it was truly inspiring. The mentorship and guidance provided by my team leaders helped me to grow both personally and professionally. The company is also very forward-thinking when it comes to technology and is always pushing the boundaries of what is possible. It was exciting to be a part of such a dynamic and innovative organization. In terms of work-life balance, Google does a great job of promoting a healthy balance. The company encourages employees to take the time they need to recharge and focus on their well-being. Overall, my experience at Google was extremely positive and I feel grateful for the opportunity to have been a part of such an incredible organization. I highly recommend the company to anyone looking for a challenging, rewarding, and innovative work experience.","It is worth noting that working at Google can also have its downsides. The company is known for its fast-paced and high-pressure environment, which can be stressful at times. Additionally, the company's size and bureaucracy can make it difficult to navigate and get things done. It may also be difficult to get noticed or promoted within the company due to the sheer number of employees and the high level of competition. Another con could be the cost of living in the area where the office is located, it could be very high, which can be a challenge for some employees. It is also worth noting that the company's policies and practices have come under scrutiny in recent years, particularly in regards to issues such as privacy and censorship.

Everyone at Google is intelligent, helpful, and friendly. The best part is diversity and inclusion. I've never felt safer being different, sharing unique ideas, and being myself at any other organization. 

The leaders and my peers constantly challenge me to grow in more ways than I can imagine. There are different programs for mentorship, which helped me discover my career path.

When major movements do happen, it's almost always with direct  SVP intervention. Everyone has a vote, and it's almost always ""no"", especially if you might get promoted ahead of them. (See point on promo culture below).
- Lots of jerks, especially in middle (Director/Senior Director and lower-rung VPs) management. 
- Poisonous promotion process.
- Increasingly back-stabby culture (I suppose that's what the influx of Tesla/Amazon people eventually brings)
- ""Followership"" and ""inclusiveness"" wielded as cudgels. No one is willing to disagree openly with anything (I'm referring to technical topics only) as a result, making the backstabbing and behind the scenes undermining really exhausting to deal with.

2. Cool projects to work on. Good balance between research & development. (See caveats below though.)
3. Supportive, healthy, psychologically safe work environment. Google cares a ton about how we work, and how we work together. The bottom-up culture also means that we have a lot of self-determination and don't feel like we're at the mercy of our management.
4. Super easy internal mobility. Lots of us change teams every couple of years. Google has so many different types of work that you won't feel you're ""stuck"" -- as long as you like working at Google overall, then you'll be able to find something interesting.
5. It's Google! Having Google on your resume opens doors to other opportunities, and it's great for networking too since generally your colleagues will be top of their field.","1. Entitlement. I make literally 5x as much as I ever dreamt. The comp is insane at FAANG companies like Google. But people here constantly complain about salary, the quality of the free food, why they have to work 5 days a week.... these are sometimes the same people who work 20 hrs a week. The amount of entitlement is insane here -- yes, we're the best of the best and we deserve a lot. But the culture and perks tend to pamper us.

2. Not all teams and projects have fulfilling work. There's lots of options, but choose carefully. Maybe you're happy getting paid to do nothing, on a team that has no visibility, so that you can ""rest and vest"" and coast. But, this will leave you woefully unprepared for your next job.... any company will hire you after Google, but that doesn't mean you'll do well at any company, particularly if you go to a more fast paced environment.",Software Engineer,Current Employee,,"May 5, 2022"

2. Cool projects to work on. Good balance between research & development. (See caveats below though.)
3. Supportive, healthy, psychologically safe work environment. Google cares a ton about how we work, and how we work together. The bottom-up culture also means that we have a lot of self-determination and don't feel like we're at the mercy of our management.
4. Super easy internal mobility. Lots of us change teams every couple of years. Google has so many different types of work that you won't feel you're ""stuck"" -- as long as you like working at Google overall, then you'll be able to find something interesting.
5. It's Google! Having Google on your resume opens doors to other opportunities, and it's great for networking too since generally your colleagues will be top of their field.","1. Entitlement. I make literally 5x as much as I ever dreamt. The comp is insane at FAANG companies like Google. But people here constantly complain about salary, the quality of the free food, why they have to work 5 days a week.... these are sometimes the same people who work 20 hrs a week. The amount of entitlement is insane here -- yes, we're the best of the best and we deserve a lot. But the culture and perks tend to pamper us.

2. Not all teams and projects have fulfilling work. There's lots of options, but choose carefully. Maybe you're happy getting paid to do nothing, on a team that has no visibility, so that you can ""rest and vest"" and coast. But, this will leave you woefully unprepared for your next job.... any company will hire you after Google, but that doesn't mean you'll do well at any company, particularly if you go to a more fast paced environment.",Software Engineer,Current Employee,,"May 5, 2022"

1746,4.0,"Not exactly a ""technical"" role","I was a TSE at GCP. I have listed the pros and cons of the role below. As you can see, the cons outweigh the pros, which is why I left for a different role within Google.

1. Great way to get your foot in the door in Google. The interview process is relatively easy (compared to SWE) and they are hiring at a fast pace. (UPDATE - Recently there has been news that they are limiting hiring in the USA and have even let go of some employees)

2. Great way to learn how a growing Cloud enterprise operates.

3. Get the Google brand on your work experience.","1. Not really a technical role. You basically resolve customer issues. There is almost no coding. This is great for people who are not technically inclined but still want to get paid well for support work. But it drained me as I did not feel challenged and had nothing to actually learn as I believe that the only way to learn is to implement things. I am surprised by how many of my fellow TSEs (with MS degrees) were OK with this sort of work.

2. No opportunities to learn and grow by building a project from scratch. This may seem like a copy of the first point but it's not. Before joining Google Cloud, I had 4 years of experience as a Software Engineer and a Data Engineer at multiple companies. In all of them, you either had a new or relatively-new project that you got assigned to and you contributed to its development. Watching your project grow and get to production is an important part of being an engineer and why I love my line of work. But this is not possible when you are flooded with cases that you need to resolve. Google does allow 20% of your time to work on projects outside of your work, but unless you come up with an idea to benefit your own sub-organization (i.e. Cloud Support), you cannot really include that work in your year-end performance review. I am observing a pattern where GCP is focussing more on hiring interns straight out of college. The good thing is that it prevents them from hiring experienced over-qualified engineers for support work. The bad thing is that many new engineering graduates will accept the fact that solving customer cases is true engineering work and will never venture outside of this proverbial well.

3. Lot of churn in employees. Based on the above 2 points, employees are dissatisfied. I have seen quite a few people either leave Google or move to a different role after less than 2 years. This reinforces my belief that I am not the only one who feels the same way about this role. This is even true even for senior leadership. During my time working there, I saw a lot of changes in the leadership structure. 

4. Customers are not the most patient people in the world. This is especially true when they are facing an issue and they have asked you to resolve it. I had a particularly bad experience when on a customer call, the customer talked to me like I was a waiter who had made a mistake with his order.
