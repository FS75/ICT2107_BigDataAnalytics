unottima azienda cui lavorare si ha lopportunit di acquisire molte competenze breve tempo uno dei principali valori aziendali la collaborazione infatti ho trovato grande disponibilit da parte dei miei superiori e dei miei colleghi pi esperti la consiglio tutti gli appassionati del mondo dei semiconduttori che pone nuove sfide un mondo sempre pi avanzato dal punto di vista tecnologico
ho lavorato per micron italia presso la sede di arzano per circa tre anni finch sono stato costretto ad andare via lavoro stressante ogni tre mesi almeno ore di banca ore regalate allazienda manager incompetenti che oggi addirittura sono diventati direttori che costringono dipendenti lavorare ore al giorno compreso fine settimana hr che nonostante conoscano perfettamente la situazione fanno finta di non sapere nulla crescita nulla eccetto per raccomandati controllo anche casa per non dire altro
nessuno tutti pessima esperienza sotto ogni aspetto ambiente molto competitivo con pochissime competenze tecniche sopratutto lato manageriale situazione conosciuta e alimentata dalle risorse umane pertanto la sconsiglio tutti e particolar modo un giovane laureato con lintenzione di crescere
pulizia poca collaborazione tt bene peccato che sia calato il lavoro e mi hanno lasciato casa bene azienda lavoro mensa colleghi superiori ottimo ambiente
ottima azienda ambiente di lavoro stimolante fatta eccezione dei turni di lavoro basati su ore
stimolante e unica luogo di crescita professionale
mi sono trovato subito molto beneanche sui ritmi di lavoroin quanto provenivo da una esperienza pluriennale azienda metalmeccanica dove ricoprivo il ruolo di supervisore
pessima esperienza sotto ogni punto di vista quanto non sono stata dipendente diretta dellazienda bens appaltata gigroup persone pessime sia nei rapporti umani e di gestione del personale disonesti mai collaborativi e pronti venire incontro alle esigenze del lavoratore non dovrebbero permettere che aziende come questa possano ancora manipolare e sfruttare le persone
difficile lavorarci per un prolungato lasso di tempo
ho avuto una buona esperianza durante questo lavoro ho imprato montaggiosmontaggio pezzi sui telai controllo qualita e altri strumenti per lavoro
ho effettuato lo stage per inserimento azienda lazienda non era disposta ad assumermi

la giornata di lavoro si svolgeva nellarea di cmp questarea caricavo lotti di wafer negli scrubber ed eseguivo qualifiche sui macchinari

la giornata lavorativa micron non si puo certo definire tipica quanto non una catena di montaggio si lavora ambiente sterile e turni diurni e notturni durano dodici ore si arriva sul posto di lavoro e si indossano indumenti protettivi atti non contaminare il materiale lavorazione semiconduttori successivamente si prendono le consegne dal turno precedente quindi si procede allo svolgimento del lavoro ho imparato la meticolosit nel rispetto delle procedure e grazie ci ho riscontrato che il lavoro prodotto pu raggiungere risultati eccellenti non ho mai avvertito lesigenza di giudicare il management maniera negativa consapevole che volte decisioni prese impopolari erano dovute politiche aziendali rivolte pi ampi orizzonti il personale dipendente essendo molto numeroso non poteva che abbracciare tipologie variegate personalmente non ho mai avuto problemi con nessuno turni notturni irrimediabilmente alterano lorologio biologico essendo di dodici ore ho lavorato unambiente dove si utilizzavano soprattutto terminologie e software lingua inglese di conseguenza ero proiettata contesti internazionali e questo mi ha arricchito professionalmente
