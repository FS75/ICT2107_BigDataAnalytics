acho que uma empesa como petrobras n tenha uma auditoria focada seu patrim nio que aprendi foi pouco em termos que eu sei hoje pois tive uma boa experi ncia ramo e acho que uma tive uma vis de fora por n ser um concursado e saber lidar com descaso patrimonial quanto aos meus colgas os que na quase maioria se encontravam na mesma situa de tempor rio como eu e isso fazia ver quanto pouco para eles era muito e por estar trabalhando em uma empresa como petrobras minha maior dificuldade foi de atingir os respons veis setor pois os indicava os erros e os mesmos n davam conta e isso momento podia ser banal mas que em um futuro pr ximo seria um fator culminante um preju zo para empresa que agradou poder ter possibilidade de mostrar que sabia em um local ao qual meu trabalho foi relevante n somente para mim mas para todos os que estavam minha volta
esta empresa mostrou ser capaz de efetuar supersaturamentos qual contra minha conduta sendo mesma com sua gerencia incapaz de serem atuantas perante aos funcion rios e n terem escr pulos com os mesmos
