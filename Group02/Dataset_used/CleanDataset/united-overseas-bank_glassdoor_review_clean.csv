1,People need to feel that their work matters by accurately evaluating their performance,nan,Being in a small branch means you can be part of a close knit community,1 Actual work does not roll up or reflect in KPIOKR In branch operations about 6070 of the time is devoted to handling day to day transactions and customer requests which means a lot of paperworkI will get to that later The scores that’s reviewed at the end of each monthquarteryear only covers 20 of the work that was done but has an overall weightage of 80 of the total performance of an employee That 20 is upsellingcrossselling of loanscardsand wait for it Personal Internet Banking 2 Company direction not aligned with overall company focus Overall UOB wants to be a tech savvy financial institution and in Group Channels it manifested mostly as “selling Personal Internet Banking” This placed most of the responsibility on the branch employees to find ways to up their numbers Some by resorting to cancel active account and sign these users up a second time A better option would be to look at the time consuming and paper dependent workflows that all customers are required whenever they step into a branch I presume things are much better now but back in 2015 everything had to be filled in pen and paper and one spelling mistake or bad handwriting would be your worst nightmare 3 People managers not equipped with the right skills This may not be applicable to all branches but in the particular branch I worked for the manager was promoted simply because she was superb at sales She failed miserably at people management and thus made everyday miserable for everyone and herself Looking back I wouldn’t say she was intentionally breathing down everyone’s neck or manipulating people to control them but I think these are the methods that she was aware ofexposed to Another reason could be that people’s welfare or overall satisfaction with their managers were not measured and thus does not contribute to her overall performance review Without this feedback channel in place managers are not getting the right help to help their employees 4 Too much importance placed on frivolous activities This is purely my personal opinion and may be very skewed given the environment I was in The channels group often had completions for cheerleading dancing and other performance which are affectionately named “CCAs” I understand the well meaning to build relationships between branches and to promote life outside work but it clearly has backfired when people started realising this is the only way to climb the ladder quickly and not by doing a good job at work Also it’s almost impossible to feel that you have a balanced grasp of your life and work when there is a ton of paperwork piling at the branch while your manager is calling you to go down for dancecheerleading practice Good intentions bad execution 5 Lastly I just HAVE to add the fake surveys How UOB measures customer satisfaction is pretty intriguing Every month employees will collect feedback forms from the walkin customers Given that this is a hard target and you have to have at least 2 per month or you will be deemed as incompetent and disqualified for the Quality Awards not all of the feedback forms were actually filled by actual customers Most were signed my gullible and unknowing customers and then later filled in by the employees themselves Some were written by actual customers of course maybe 10 of all submission Again another good intention scheme execution gone wrong,Service Manager,Former Employee,Singapore,26/04/2018
