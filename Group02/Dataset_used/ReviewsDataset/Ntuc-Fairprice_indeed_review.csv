3.0,My opinion and experiences.,"The work is straight forward and simple to handle.
However, the remuneration is very low, and the working hour is long.
We are required to work on most public holidays, without any double compensation.
Most of the staff are cooperative, except for a few.
Nothing is too difficult, except for some people who gets impatient, when there is a sudden influx of customers in the queue for delivery services.
Nothing is too difficult, except for some unreasonable or difficult customers' who loves to complaint; even for some minor issues, or when they could not get a replacement or refunds.
These customers' requires our tactfulness, and soft skill to handle.
At all times, do not offend them, even though, they may be nasty.
Just avoid any argument, and quickly get a fellow colleague to assist you in handling the customer, so as to appease him/her.

Learned a lot of stuff but mostly about retail
Stock ordering is the hardest sometime it sell fast because there is an offer sometime it just stuck in your backstore seeing those stock being sold i feel some sense of achievement

Co worker are friendly mostly older than me able to talk about stuff that i have no idea some in the past some in other industry and some slice of life

For hardest part of the work before i promoted to retail supervisor i thought that it was ordering but after i was promoted i found out that coordinating and arrange stock is the hardest such as every thursday advertise special and weekly fair/offer/mustbuy/purchase with purchase and sometime new stock that have been launched we have to arrange into normal shelf without breaking the previous arrangement grouping

The enjoyable part of the job would be seeing customer able to get what they want to buy and happily head off to the counter
for example few occasion when customer asked me location of the items they want and i was able to show it to them and they thanked me and head off to the counter some even came from faraway just to get the stuff of course nice versa if after i showed customer the product location and its out of stock i would feel a bit remorse especially if i was in charge of the lane that the product was.",,,Retail Supervisor,Current Employee,Punggol waterway point,"August 15, 2016"

4.0,Place where I learn a lot about working life.,"The typical day at work start with quality checking all the goods displayed in the store and remove any goods which has gone bad or look bad. Then replenish the goods if those displayed is depleting very quickly. Soon we will get ready for the arrival of the stocks. And this is where team work will happen, my co-workers and I will move the stocks together because they are really heavy and we will be assigned to replenish different goods to speed things up.

Basically, team work is key and also being able to attend to customers' queries. Some times, customers would not be able to find certain products and they will ask any staff they see. So even though the product is not under your section, you need to be able to know where exactly it is placed to help customer. Thus, I also learn that we should be fully aware of our working environment.

The hardest part of this job is definitely unloading the goods, because each box of apples are of multiple kgs and we do not have proper equipment which can help unload the goods easier. And hence, most of the time, we might end up hurting ourselves,
