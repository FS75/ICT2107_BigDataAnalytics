4.0,Good place to work,"As a contractor, you are not expected of much performance at the same time can't excel much for career advancement.

2.0,Equity grants are a scam.,"Corporate lifestyle has taken over. Layoffs as a tool for corporate profits. Equity is just a way for them to retroactively pay you less for your work. They have all of the things that you would expect from big tech, pool tables, games, etc. But will track you and it will be reflected in your pay/layoffs if you are caught using them. Absolutely 0 support for childcare including when they force overtime. They pay less than competitors relying on their culture to draw people in.

below ChatGPT generated CONTENT.

As an AI language model, I don't have personal experience working at Google, but I can provide you with information about what it's like to work at Google based on research and feedback from employees.

Google is one of the world's largest and most successful technology companies, and it is known for its innovative and fun work culture. Employees are offered a range of perks and benefits, such as free meals, onsite gym, and wellness programs. Google also emphasizes employee growth and development, offering opportunities for education and training, as well as the chance to work on exciting and impactful projects.

Google's work environment is collaborative and team-oriented, with a focus on open communication and sharing ideas. Employees are encouraged to be creative and think outside the box, and there are many opportunities for cross-functional collaboration and learning.

However, some employees have also reported challenges with the high workload and long hours required to keep up with the fast-paced and competitive environment. The work can also be demanding and high-pressure, with tight deadlines and high expectations.

Overall, working at Google is generally considered a great experience, with many opportunities for growth and development, exciting projects, and a fun and collaborative work culture.

3.0,Company benefit is great and all but...,"But the management isn't pro-employee enough to defend a hard working employee from getting laid off. They laid off a hardworking, productive and performing employee and kept those non productive and non performing (metrics and attendance wise). They cannot even give a solid answer and just respond in a robotic way of ""it was a business decision"". That's not true because at some point, there are people who made the decision and the decision should be made logically.",,,Senior Associate,Former Employee,Taguig City,"March 3, 2023"

3.0,Overall OK,"Work/life balance is great, (they encourage time off) Datacenter and office culture are very different. Very difficult to advance/transfer in a datacenter role vs a role that doesn't support a datacenter.

Noticed far more dudes & non-BIPOC where i worked. Diversity is said to be important but not really reflected.,,,Intern,Former Employee,Remote,"February 17, 2023"
3.0,good,"Coaching can require a delicate balance, as the second-ranked trait of good managers at Google is that they do not micromanage employees and, instead, empower their team to take control of their own work and projects. In other words, feedback and advice can be extremely helpful for employees, but they also need to be given enough reign to get their work done without constant interference that can cause delays and hurt performance.",,,Manager,Former Employee,"Las Vegas, NV","February 17, 2023"
1.0,Empire in decline,"Google has been the most dysfunctional place I've ever worked. The quality of leadership is poor, especially at the middle management level. Projects are often launched with the aim of someone getting a promotion, and then quickly axed.

3.0,Productive,"Pros

1) Food, food, food. 15+ cafes on main campus (MTV) alone. Mini-kitchens, snacks, drinks, free breakfast/lunch/dinner, all day, errr'day.

2) Benefits/perks. Free 24:7 gym access (on MTV campus). Free (self service) laundry (washer/dryer) available. Bowling alley. Volley ball pit. Custom-built and exclusive employee use only outdoor sport park (MTV). Free health/fitness assessments. Dog-friendly. Etc. etc. etc.

3) Compensation. In ~2010 or 2011, Google updated its compensation packages so that they were more competitive.

4) For the size of the organization (30K+), it has remained relatively innovative, nimble, and fast-paced and open with communication but, that is definitely changing (for the worse).

5) With so many departments, focus areas, and products, *in theory*, you should have plenty of opportunity to grow your career (horizontally or vertically). In practice, not true.

6) You get to work with some of the brightest, most innovative and hard-working/diligent minds in the industry. There's a ""con"" to that, too (see below).

Cons

1) Work/life balance. What balance? All those perks and benefits are an illusion. They keep you at work and they help you to be more productive. I've never met anybody at Google who actually time off on weekends or on vacations. You may not hear management say, ""You have to work on weekends/vacations"" but, they set the culture by doing so - and it inevitably trickles down. I don't know if Google inadvertently hires the work-a-holics or if they create work-a-holics in us. Regardless, I have seen way too many of the following: marriages -

2.0,They make it look good on the outside but that's a lie,It's a toxic place to be. Google puts a pretty bow on some pretty terrible things. You are expendable. The food may it may not be good. You get micromanaged. The culture had gone downhill.,,,Data Center Technician,Former Employee,"Pryor, OK","February 9, 2023"
5.0,Still the best place for a newbie,"Despite everything that's been happening, Google is still one of the best employers to get your software engineering career off the ground. It's the best ""school"" for software engineers one could ask for. You learn a lot, get paid well, and don't get stressed out. Work isn't always exciting, but once you stay on a team for a while and earn the trust of colleagues, the interesting work tends to come in.

Finally, Google is still a business, so please don't believe all the fairy tales on the Internet.",,,Senior Software Engineer,Former Employee,"New York, NY","February 9, 2023"

2.0,"Used to be great, now it's a ""conventional"" company","(Most) Sales managers are not leaders, but rule because of their rank. Managers are not inspirational and are simply looking for more power through land grabs, taking credit for employees great work, calling them out on the poor work and don't care about helping those that report to them.

Great work goes unappreciated as managers focus on what you're doing wrong.

Trust is lost, there is no psychological safety any longer. I feel for those remaining at the company. It's so much better being on the outside looking in.",,,Senior Account Executive,Former Employee,"Atlanta, GA","February 6, 2023"
4.0,Fun work place,"Working as a graphic designer at Google was a challenging but fun experience. The company demands the highest level of excellence from its employees, and this was reflected in the demanding and fast-paced work environment.

Only think I dislike is spineless leadership and a decaying sense of job security with the recent layoff of over 12k+ people, a good portion of which were well-respected people.

Leadership never gives clear answers and take definitive stands, especially in regards to Googlers.",,,Software Engineer,Current Employee,"Mountain View, CA","February 3, 2023"

General culture in the global business organization (not pure sales): hard-working, friendly people who care about doing their jobs well. Managers that care about work life balance.

3.0,Fun place to work but leaves you feeling paranoid.,"Google is one of those dreams everyone hopes to fulfill. It’s great the first year or two. But getting promoted is really a punishment. Yeah you get great benefits and decent pay. But management is hit or miss. You have a 50% chance of getting a toxic boss. And I mean bosses that make you feel like your life should revolve around them. It’s not micromanaged but more like a cult where you get sucked into the culture and feel guilty for ever looking for something better. They have kids and pets and family that you get emotionally invested and it’s hard to pull yourself out of a culture like that.

You never know if an award is really an award or a way to manipulate and control you. Like I did this for you and you owe me now. It’s an emotional debt you can never pay. When you have a great boss, you feel the same level of paranoia where you aren’t sure if it’s corporate gaslighting culture or you aren’t appreciative enough.

Not only are the staff very nice, but the job also pays well too. One thing that really helped me in this company was the food and snack program. When I graduated from college and just got into the company I was struggling with money. I was unable to afford a plate to eat but after getting into the company I was able to eat due to the free lunches and snacks provided, and keep myself energized which enhanced my working ability.

4.0,"In general, Google lives up to its billing as a great place to work, although there are differences between offices and teams.","Google certainly spoils its employees with all of the well known perks: free meals, funky offices, etc. And while many people will complain about pay, the truth is that Googlers are generally very well compensated.
But all of this comes with clear expectations to perform. Also, the large size of the company means that many senior managers are external hires and they bring with them the cultural baggage of their previous employers. The interview process is meant to ensure cultural fit, but no process is perfect. The result is that the culture can vary a lot from office to office or team to team within larger offices.",,,GLOBAL CLIENT EXECUTIVE,Former Employee,Paris,"February 6, 2022"
4.0,Pretty solid,"Once you get in the groove of things and if you're a good driver it is quite an easy job. Pretty nice to be able to listen to music/podcasts and visit new cities daily.
Biggest downside is the pay. Adecco does the recruiting, drivers are paid the same rate across the country. $15 an hour, which is the pay, is very different in Massachusetts is comparison to Alabama. There is absolutely no overtime either. So people that are capable of driving even longer per day, or want to work an extra day on the weekend, are unable to do that.

5.0,Productive and fun workplace,"Productive and fun workplace, Pros

1) Food, food, food. 15+ cafes on main campus (MTV) alone. Mini-kitchens, snacks, drinks, free breakfast/lunch/dinner, all day, errr'day.

2) Benefits/perks. Free 24:7 gym access (on MTV campus). Free (self service) laundry (washer/dryer) available. Bowling alley. Volley ball pit. Custom-built and exclusive employee use only outdoor sport park (MTV). Free health/fitness assessments. Dog-friendly. Etc. etc. etc.

3) Compensation. In ~2010 or 2011, Google updated its compensation packages so that they were more competitive.

4) For the size of the organization (30K+), it has remained relatively innovative, nimble, and fast-paced and open with communication but, that is definitely changing (for the worse).

5) With so many departments, focus areas, and products, *in theory*, you should have plenty of opportunity to grow your career (horizontally or vertically). In practice, not true.

6) You get to work with some of the brightest, most innovative and hard-working/diligent minds in the industry. There's a ""con"" to that, too (see below).

Cons

1) Work/life balance. What balance? All those perks and benefits are an illusion. They keep you at work and they help you to be more productive. I've never met anybody at Google who actually time off on weekends or on vacations. You may not hear management say, ""You have to work on weekends/vacations"" but, they set the culture by doing so - and it inevitably trickles down. I don't know if Google inadvertently hires the work-a-holics or if they create work-a-holics in us. Regardless, I have seen way too many",,,Software Engineer,Former Employee,"San Francisco, CA","November 8, 2021"

4.0,"Great for FTE, contractors beware!","First of all, amazing tech stack, great engineers, interesting projects, more knowledge and resources available than you can handle. You have to learn all the time and not stick to some specific stack as there's constant development and deprecation going on. Not the environment for everybody but if you have a boy-scout attitude you will be happy there. I am for this part.

For the organizational aspects it's not great though. A lot of chaotic changes happened just so that someone can have a great performance evaluation to jump to another team after which the project is forgotten (I've seen it happen many times). It's amazing how many resources are wasted for meaningless work. It's sad to see engineers taking over management tasks from incompetent managers just to get work done.

For the cultural part, don't be fooled - it's not the same open and inclusive company as it used to be. People get fired for saying the ugly truth. The hierarchy is much more enforced than it used to be (in my org tree). Make sure you work there as a full-time employee (FTE) and not let's say a contractor. If you're a contractor like me, doing the same full-time engineering work as my FTE peers and for many years just on different contract (but same NDAs), prepare for getting different treatment. This is sad especially that the majority of the workforce are contractors/vendors etc. Some examples:
- I need to pass some security trainings annually which say that contractors/temps/vendors are trouble and a security threat.
- I receive a lot of company-wide communication inviting me to events and trainings",,,Application Engineer,Current Employee,Poland,"November 5, 2021"

5.0,"Overall great company, smart people and great benefits","WFH at the moment with the option to go into the office. Good amount of time with clients but way too many internal meetings. Self promotion and side projects are keys to success, not necessarily your day to day tasks. Many opportunities to learn and network and you can fill that in with other trainings on diversity and personal growth. Culture varies by team, but for the most part everyone is friendly and willing to help. Total opposite of 'cut-throat.' However, that also breeds some complacency.

Hardest part of the job sometimes is staying motivated because there's little incentive to keep pushing at times. Loads of filler meetings where nothing gets accomplished.

Best part is work/life balance, benefits and team culture. Worst part is up-leveling your position in the company (management track is non-existent), the promotion process (only getting harder and longer for long time Googlers), and the inability to obtain more money (no room to ask for a 'raise' as it's all done algorithmically and even in sales it's fairly difficult to blow your quota out of the water, albeit you will usually hit your goals or come close).",,,Account Executive,Current Employee,"New York, NY","October 19, 2021"

In practice, not true. 6) You get to work with some of the brightest, most innovative and hard-working/diligent minds in the industry.

1.0,Extremely poor management and exclusion of contract workers,"Was working for Google on behalf of a recruitment agency (on a contract). It is the worst experience I have ever had in my career. I am a senior employee with lots of experience and have always enjoyed being a consultant. At Google, consultants are not treated like human beings. The management swore at me and the team constantly, gave timelines on projects that did not take any consideration of weekends, holidays, etc. We are not allowed to ‘speak to Googlers’ (these exact words are used) - we are only allowed to speak to our recruitment agency, but Googlers are allowed to speak to as in any way they want, when they so wish.

We cannot complain, we do not get any benefits. Since the pandemic we have worked from home and we got nothing to help us. No budget for desks, no budget for extra screens. No questions of how we were doing. I have never in my career experiences worse treatment of human beings in a workplace and I am very happy that I can find a job elsewhere.

Work hours are whatever I see fit and I have been provided with everything to equip my WFH environment. The offices are amazing and it's the first time I look forward to going there. The benefits and perks are great, you are actually encourage to take leaves, PTO and enjoy extra days off.
Once you have a certain tenure, be prepared to deliver or be left behind. This is a meritocracy and just sitting around doing nothing will get out of the door.

3.0,Google Cloud has a lot of challenges,"Working at Google cloud has many challenges, and it seems like leadership does not understand them well. Managers are not well trained, they have many people who they manage, and they do not provide proactive advice or support. It is difficult to speak with leadership, and when leadership finally has time to connect, in my experience, I feel like I am never heard, and my issues take multiple ""at-bats"" to be solved.

3.0,Contractor Engineer at Google,"Depends on your department, but from what I've seen is contractors are held very low at Google. There is little to no flexibility, especially when asking for time-off. There is basically no support from managers expect to meet job quotas and contractors are severely underpaid compared to their full-time employed co-workers who do literally the same job. And no matter what, don't trust recruiters when they say conversion is possible. Seriously, with the recent re-orgs and budget changes, head-count availability changes almost daily. I've seen contractors either laid off after their contract ends or pushed to become a vendor so there's less limitations on how long they can work at Google.

On the bright side, they are implementing a standard for contractors to get some more benefits from their hiring companies, can't say if this affects the hourly wage as I've left a while ago in search for better pay.",,,Contract Engineer,Former Employee,"Mountain View, CA","July 16, 2020"

Positive Outlook

No opinion of CEO

I worked at Google (Less than a year)

Pros

The people are very nice and smart. the dress is casual. the cubicles are quiet. The food is good. A fun place to work.
The security staff is nice, and some will become good friends.

Cons

The datacenter never has enough tools.
You feel completely alone and it seems that you shouldn't ask questions once you're let loose post-trainig.
I broke down crying a few times on the datacenter floor because I couldn't find any answers or documentation from their intranet or from other employees.
They want a phd level of intelligence to work for 20$/hr.
Atlanta is the neglected ""redheaded stepchild"" data center.
Can be somewhat political, but if you don't get involved with or discuss politics anywhere on memegen or on the internal mailing lists or if you're smart enough to be engage in a neutral manner or pretend to side with the ""correct"" politics rather than your own political beliefs, you'll be alright.
I sweat a lot, and no one told me that I could bring spill-proof tumblers or clear drink containers on the DC floor!

The training was excellent. But safety protocols conflict with the speed that repairs MUST be accomplished. Eg: you must take shortcuts, like not wear globes when doing battery swaps, even if it's not safe. I was probably fired for not wearing gloves during the week that safety inspectors were onsite, however I was never told that they even have gloves or where they were!

Senior management is very stable and seems to relish or tolerate this chaos as some sort of professional development or as a way to churn out the undesirables.

The truth is that Google is an empty shell, supported by massive revenue from AdSense, its only valuable and really first product. The rest seems to be a journey to somewhere, but without ""Rich Uncle AdSense"" nothing else would be possible.

If you are lucky enough to land a good paying job here (there are some), do your work, keep your opinions to yourself and nod you head when they all say they are liberals, woke, Marxist, etc. They claim to be free thinkers, as long as you agree with them 100%.

2.0,Toxic Culture and Incompetent Managers,"The marketing culture (not the engineering culture, mind you) is toxic and getting worse. New managers are brought in and pretend to be kind and genuinely care about your personal growth as long as their probation lasts. When their probation ends, you quickly realize that yelling and humiliating in public are the only management tools that they intend to keep. And they will keep yelling and humiliating until your projects hit a dead end and have to give up and leave your job so that there's more room left for new hires, also known as ""my people"" new hires.

3.0,Pampers employees too much to the point of distraction; frontend developer skills will languish,"* Perks are too much really, and I would feel guilty complaining about any of them. However, I'd much rather give up all my perks for the opportunity to work from home instead.
* Was very frustrating from the perspective of an employee of a startup that was acquired. After getting acquired, all the state-of-the-art competitive software had to be re-written to fit Google's standards: coding style, build tools, and software libraries and protocols. This felt the opposite of freedom. Also, it was super hard even getting our first code checked into the monolithic codebase, as no one in the company had ""readability"" in any programming languages. As such, we had to hire folks from other parts of Google, as well as get ""buddies"" within Google to help review our code. More handcuffs...
* Mostly young workforce, with many from privileged backgrounds, with highly materialistic wants. ""Smart"" gets thrown around a lot. There are many smart people, and also many weird characters. As someone who came in through an acquisition, I increasingly felt that I just didn't belong there, as I'd skipped the entire interview process.
* A very stable build system and well-written tech stack, at the cost of severe NIH, overall developmental slowness, and very outdated tech. No opportunity to code with React.js, a very dominant framework used outside of Google (competing with Angular 2)
* Frontend developers are not really taken seriously. JavaScript is barely tolerated as a ""real language"" and the tech stack and build tools were completely disparate from the real world.",,,Software Engineer,Former Employee,"Mountain View, CA","October 12, 2019"

However, the internship could have been more organized. I didn't work directly for the manger who appraised my performance. Therefore, there was a disconnect between the impression that my supervisor had and the one that my appraiser had. Also, the person who appraised my work was just a very critical person who always look to blame people that she over saw.

3.0,"Yes, Google has sushi and many perks, but there are big issues.","I worked as a contractor at Google X. Working there was great. I enjoyed working with the other engineers very much. Lunch was good. Everyone was accommodating. That said, two things stood out as a problem. Contractors are treated differently in terms of security and processing. It took weeks to get my credentials figured out so I could use email and to use the build system. Security is tight there, and slow. My access to the building took two or more weeks to clear. I was not able to access all of the code I needed to do my job.

The worst part is that contractors are treated as a security risk, so they get no heads up when there services are no longer needed. Just a simple ""this is your last day. Clean up your desk, leave your computer, and head out."" That's it.

2.0,Terrible departments make for terrible lives,"I almost never knew the ""greater picture"" of where my team was headed, because the entire department seemed to have no clue. I would be told something by someone on my team who heard it in passing from our manager, and then the exact opposite would happen in two weeks. Even when that manager quit, the same things kept happening, and even when I switched teams (within the same department), so I believe the entire department was rotting from the head.

I saw excessive amounts of waste at every turn. Corporate culture is one of laziness and complacency, to the point where trying to pick up extra work that is technically beyond the scope of your job title will actually penalize you. I had to argue for weeks to convince a senior engineer to make a one line, basic change to top of rack switch because he simply didn't want to do it, and there was literally no recourse for me (I quit before he did, if he ever did).

There are also some really sketchy activity going on inside, and attempts at bringing said activity to light will most likely only end poorly for you.

Overall, it started off great when I was still enamored by the name ""Google"" and was but a lowly peon. But as my team members quickly quit and my responsibilities expanded to encompass their old duties (because hiring for your team is also a nightmare), I saw more and more of the grit beneath the glamor. I have no intention of ever working for Google again.

I do feel I need to say that the Facilities team gets stuff done, though. Every interaction I had with them was pleasant, every ticket I submitted was resolved -

I also learned to manage my time during each section because of different priorities. Overall, I think the hardest part was to learn all the technologies that were used for the tasks.

+ At Google you're standing on the shoulders of giants. They've built the best developer tools and a wealth of great internal documentation for technologies and engineering practices. During my first few months at Google I learned a ton from internal resources and learning about their technical infrastructure.
+ Overall good culture of transparency, giving voice to employees, and trying to make sure employees are happy.
+ Good compensation.

Cons:
Google is huge, and this has a number of consequences. For one, many engineering teams move very slowly. Lots of red tape, and lots of huge systems to integrate with. Very deep management chains. For an individual contributor, decisions may be made many levels above you and you have very little input or context.

Depending on the team, it can be hard to have meaningful impact at Google. Some systems are so old they are already fully optimized, others are just so large that you're unlikely to touch more than a small piece or sub system. Most engineers at Google aren't solving the worlds hardest/funnest problems--their just manning the ship, making sure things don't break and adding small incremental improvements. Getting into ""sexy"" product areas is extremely competitive.",,,"Software Engineer III, Platforms Storage",Current Employee,"Sunnyvale, CA","June 11, 2019"

I am a vendor, and overall I will say have been treated well, and with kindness and respect. My only real issue is that despite many years working there, it's very hard to be made from a vendor to a permanent employee, and there is little room for advancement. If you are a TVC, you'll have to remember that overall, that is the case. Unless you are excellent at what you do and happen to be at the right place at the right time, you'll probably do best to work there, get a solid reputation and skillset, and then use the Google name to go somewhere else.

I was on the pre-sales team and so I was directly dependent upon my post-sales team to accomplish the remainder of the sale which they often failed which impacted my quota and left animosity amongst my manager and myself.

1.0,Mass Exodus,"Some nice people, some smart people, and you're part of something that is helping people. Unfortunately the company is poorly managed at most levels and faces strong competition at both the high and low end. Basic project management precepts like how to prioritize and manage scope, cost, and schedule seems beyond them. Managing feature creep at the product definition phase is one of their biggest weaknesses. These over featured products then go into development, the aspirational features that would have been market differentiators have development issues that then affect schedule and/or cost, people live in China for months, and eventually something less than desired reaches the market late with poor financials. However lately it isn't even aspirational features that are burdening product definitions. It's just trying to keep up with released features on competitors products. Meanwhile Xiaomi sells it cheaper, Garmin sells it better, and Apple sells it cooler. Fitbit is at most two bad product intros away from oblivion.

This has triggered a mass exodus of talent, which Fitbit has encouraged, augmented by several small, stealth layoffs. Its current financials are challenged enough that it can't afford to keep the people that it needs. The overall effect creates this kind of dark mood, intensified by the increasing number of empty desks, that pervades the organization. No one is surprised any more to hear that a colleague has left. There's more a feeling of being happy for them that they found a way out, maybe with some quiet envy.

4.0,Great experience even as a contractor..,"I love working at Google! If you get a chance to work here, definitely do it! Whether you come in as a contractor or a permanent employee, you definitely will get the experience of a lifetime.

With that being said.. I do feel like contractors (known as TVCs) are treated differently. I still think there is an overall great culture, but I wish they gave TVCs some of the resources they give permanent employees. Part of the reason I'm open to other opportunities is that there really isn't a clear path to conversion, the line is pretty blurred. Not to mention you have to re-interview for it.

Google loves people that ""thrive in ambiguity"" but as a TVC it's a little concerning when you don't have much guidance on how to push for conversion. You are essentially doing the exact same job as permanent employees, but apart from good numbers they want to see other intangibles to really have a strong case for conversion. Some of the top performers on my team were TVCs but unfortunately are not at Google anymore because they didn't make it through the conversion process.

Would I take this job as a TVC again? Probably. I admire this company and love how much you grow as a professional. I am definitely still gonna give the conversion process a shot, but I'm also realistic and know I need to be keeping my options open.",,,Sourcing Recruiter,Current Employee,"Austin, TX","February 11, 2019"

I would recommend this job to people who are just stepping their foot into the workforce or people who need extra cash. I enjoyed the bond I made with fellow coworkers, there were a great bunch of people on the team. One negative aspect is that the contract is only a year and after 3 months you are eligible to reapply. Another one is that you are not informed about exactly when your contract is close to being up so you can prepare yourself to look for another job.

1.0,Poor management style at Google,"Management at Google has very low regard for anyone who comes in as a contractor. Very low percentages of people will get converted into a direct position, regardless of the quality of your work.

In addition, if you work as a contractor, they will not allow you to have the information that you need to do your job. You will also not be allowed to attend meetings to discuss the information that you need.

The smartest thing that you can do is just avoid the company altogether, unless they offer you a direct position with good pay and benefits for the area where you are located.

She had chosen not to have children and regularly gave team members who did have kids a sour face when they needed to work from home to take care of sick children. She expected people to be on from morning until evening, and set goals that were impossible to reach without 80-hour workweeks.

4.0,Great Pay Horrible Management,In the beginning I loved working at Google Express but there are several layers of management you have to get thru in order for your problems to be solved.

You are paid almost nothing and expected to do the same, sometimes maybe even more work than full time Google employees are expected to do. You may be given a day off because Google is off, but some of us don't get paid for those days. When you are working on a budget that is really hard some days (especially near the holidays) Work is very stressful at times and instead of finding ways to improve our work environment, they take more things away.

1.0,"Fake Culture of ""Transparency""","Management preaches ""transparency"" but does not practice it. Managers exclude engineers from meetings in which their deliverables are discussed with stakeholders and then present the decisions as ""personal goals.""

Managers do not understand the technology they order engineers to use. They don't care. Their priorities are to tell management above them what it wants to hear.

Fitbit says that it wanted to convert contract employees to full-time after six months, but it often takes a year. Employees on work visas frequently have their conversions delayed even longer, which keeps them dependent on the company.

Management does a very poor job of managing itself. Oversized egos remain oversized. Fitbit is good at promoting Dr Jekyll and clueless when it comes to dealing with Mr Hyde.

3.0,"Must be highly self-actualized, to thrive in a sometimes chaotic culture","Google is great for Engineers. For managers of product, process, projects or of people you often have to ""create your job"", and maintain a high-performance image. You are told to do this by building your internal resume. And you should, always noting your ""impact"". You need to define your role and make sure your manager and your stakeholders understand it and agree. You may think hear you have the charter to blaze a new trail, but you need to be careful, there is a lot of coopetition, and some people would like to see you fail. Some people are guarding their territory and they don't think they need to align with your new process or whatever - and they don't . It's a tough place for a new ""expert"" type who's charter involves change. Do a lot of listening, and find ways to align with people and pick their brain. Ask questions. And travel to meet remote people you need to work with, in person, with an agenda. The Compensation/Benefits are good. Some positions and in some teams you need to be politically adept. The culture in many teams is not exactly friendly, especially if some external perceptions of the team are negative - it can feel a bit paranoid.

The job was great overall and each day was enjoyable working with the other people.
The culture left something to be desired as the information was kept amongst certain people.
Management was very intimidating as they only shared certain information with their favorites.

4.0,Contractor,"As a contractor I worked at Mountain View and also on the YouTube Ads project in San Bruno.

The former was excellent, with an excellent supervisor. The contract was supposed to last one year and went two. Very happy.
I learned much from the other programmers and engineers (both Google employees and fellow contractors). The ergonomics of my desk and chair were excellent. The lighting is a bit harsh and the air quality was terrible on the weekends. I am used to an office and it was really weird sitting across from someone and when you looked up they might be staring back. Just weird!

Now, that was the good one. Following that, I worked in San Bruno on the YouTube Red project. It was extremely annoying and we were treated poorly. At YouTube our supervisor was terrible. I can honestly say she was the worst manager I've ever worked for. Blamed us for her lack of procedure and disorganization. Instead of real coding (and Graphics as promised) we spent our days and sometimes nights trying to modify an often broken and bizarre script-based system. We couldn't even get access to fix the broken parts! Super annoying.

I would work in Mountain View in a heartbeat. San Bruno and YouTube - never again. Stay away if you cherish your mental health.

Finally, a bit of a warning, for older engineers and contractors: expect to be left out of the culture. If you have a thin skin this might bug you. I didn't bother me much though and now and again, at Mountain View, I was often invited to events by my supervisor that really weren't supposed to be for contractors.",,,Senior Software Developer,Former Employee,"Mountain View, CA","September 18, 2018"

Leadership team and management are well educated and grounded to have a proper understanding, maintain healthy relationship where workplace culture has motivated every individual for better productivity and positive attitude.

1.0,"Long working hours, on the upside, great on your resume","I had my first job out of college here, and even though the offices are amazing, with all the perks you could ever want or expect, you work so much that this is basically no need for it, as me and most people in my team were working closer to 50-60 hours a lot of weeks than the 45 originally suggested in the contract.

I feel that Google, at least in Dublin has a unhealthy culture. This is down to the expectation of working large amounts of unpaid overtime, very sharp elbows and strange management styles. I feel that the overarching sentiment from management at least in my team was leadership by fear. It always also seemed very political, in the way that who you knew and how well you know them was always more important than what you actually did.

3.0,Fun job but could've been better,"A day at google as a store operator was very consistent, not much changed, I learned to move at a very fast pace (timing was everything), how to work in the warehouse field, packaging and shipment. There wasn't much management due to the fact, we all pretty much did the same thing, there was no one higher up than you can go too besides a lead and they knew just as much as the store operators did, maybe a little more. The workplace varied depending on what store you were stationed at for the day or week, which could change at any given day/time. The hardest part of the job was trying to meet our delivery window when orders were flowing in, basically like a rush hour, and not being able to communicate with a boss or someone who should be over the whole store operators, not just leads. I enjoyed traveling to different places, different stores, meeting lots of new people, at Google you never really knew who you were going to be working with for the day or if things changed from the day before or not.",,,Store Operator,Former Employee,"San Bruno, CA","August 23, 2018"

During my time at Google, i managed to learn different ways of working. for example working the same tasks but in different ways due to the difference in employees working there and how they get things done.There was no correct way to do things but rather finding a way that suited you to do things.
The culture within the workplace was an amazing experience. The different types of food on offer for breakfast lunch and dinner. The level of pressure wasn't like other workplaces. Although many tasks were required to get done.

5.0,Awesome company,"I didn't mind staying late there as long as I could catch the train (commuter) and getting in early was normal. Plus you can catch a really healthy and delicious breakfast.

Other than a bit of posturing from teammates mostly from Ivy schools at the beginning, everyone is respectful and friendly.

Engineering is a clear favorite in the company though management receive high compensation as well.

Meetings are frequent but brief. People are expected to do more than the standard. That's what the perks are for I believe. The environment is comfortable so try to outperform and bring in more value for their cost (your compensation).

If I had to be picky, the only cons I experienced were (coming from smaller companies) that even if you were proficient in another area, you often couldn't apply it because roles are more strictly defined at a large company such as Google. There are security and policy procedures that limit access.

I read elsewhere that some people found some employees to be arrogant. I found that to be the rare minority. Even in those cases, if you prove yourself good at what you do, you win respect. When I started, I came from a state college and 80% of my team were Harvard grads. They did their clique-y thing on occasion. But they didn't realize I went to state university because my family wasn't well off, and I dropped my GPA at the end pursuing athletic and gaming competitions on a national level.

We were provided with free snacks and drinks, but as a contractor had to pay for food and gym membership while Google employees ate for free and got to use the gym for free. It is pretty fast paced and guidance changes frequently. Pay is terrible compared to what actual Google employees make, and there was not a lot of room for growth in my contract position. We basically got to wear what ever we wanted (within reason) and the atmosphere was super relaxed, not micromanaged.

Unfortunately, after I had been at Google about three months our VP decided that all of his team that worked in the United States outside of Mountain View had to move to Mountain View. I was one of seven people on the team outside of Mountain View and another of the seven was my manager.

The most enjoyable part of the job are definitely the amenities that come with the office. There is a gym on site along with a trainer who teaches classes at different times and provides excellent advice for your personal fitness goals.

Here is where things get a little complicated. As a contractor/vendor, you get office access just like the Google full time employees .

5.0,Fast paced entertaining but competitive workspace,I was a contractor at google so not an official googler and they make sure you remember that all the time.

3.0,It can be tough to be a temp staff,"While it's great to have access to a Google office and work alongside Googlers, it can be painful to be reminded that you're a 'lesser' employee when office announcements often contain 'for FTES* only'.

However, Google is a big company; each team can be very different with each other so one's experience can depend on one's team. After a restructuring, my team's new management is horrible to us, temps. Due to large volumes of turnover, our most senior manager finally met us personally with apologies and promises to fix things.

Lo and behold, we all were served with a layoff notice via email a few weeks ago because the management has turned the team's model into that of vendors so all the temps will be out by the end of the year. We weren't warned before this and when people voiced out their anxiety with the aforementioned manager, she was taken aback and surprised with our reaction as she thought the news wasn't a big deal and >6 months of notice is more than sufficient. Such is the lack of empathy and connection between temps and the highest management of my team. Fyi, all the improvement measures would be thrown out the window with this change as well.

4.0,Contract at Google,"I worked as a contractor for 2 years at Google, and overall it was a positive experience. The culture and benefits of being onsite were incredible, but being a contractor had a lot of downsides. I performed at a high level and they chose not to convert me (or many of my coworkers) to FT status because they preferred to hire people fresh out of Ivy League schools. With the culture of companies moving away from this model (and with how broken the university system is in general), I was surprised to see Google wasn't at the forefront of hiring people based on talent and not based on where they went to school.",,,Recruiting Coordinator (Contract),Former Employee,"Mountain View, CA","April 23, 2018"

I learned a lot on how Google executes business practices in fluid and collaborative ways without getting bogged down in paperwork. The Management Team is highly technical, they could provide feedback for challenging solutions and guidance on how to wrangle them. Google's workplace culture is collaborative but highly competitive, you always need to bring you ""A"" game on a daily basis. The hardest part of the job was trying to manage work life, as the demands for getting projects completed on time were paramount.

3.0,"Contracting sucks, but Google is good","My summary has been:
Working on contract is terrible,
Working for Google is awesome,
So working for Google on contract is a very interesting experience.

The in office perks are very nice, your co-workers and manager are great in that they are both nice people and very good at their jobs and you have very interesting things to work on on a challenging timeline. Its a very good place to be.
However, as a contractor, the company's actions make it clear they do not care about you at all. You don't have any job security, so you don't know if you'll be there in 6 months and you can only be there a maximum of 2 years regardless how much your team values you (unless there is budgetary miracle). There are regular meetings and off-site events for team building that you are not invited to, which has rather the opposite effect. It doesn't matter how inclusive or devoted to psychological security your culture is if half the employees don't have job security.

And the people on the ground know its is terrible but the practice persists for economic reasons (since contractors cost about half what full employees do). Like as a contractor I was not invited to the holiday party, but full time employees that couldn't go would give their invites to contractors; so the employees would work around company policies to mitigate that damage to morale and tea-mates. It was a weird disconnect.

But like I said, Google is a great place to work, you'll meet great people, work on very interesting things, and have opportunities you don't have anywhere else. If you're contractor just be prepared",,,User Experience Researcher,Former Employee,"Mountain View, CA","March 15, 2018"

4.0,Interesting experience,This was a new experience for me since it was my first exposure to a true sourcing role. This was great experience in sourcing but was limited to just that so was not the best long term fit for me.,,,Technical Recruiter/Sourcer,Former Employee,"Austin, TX","January 28, 2018"

5.0,"Great place to start as a TVC, not so good to stay","Google is a wonderful place to work, I wish I never left! As a TVC though, your experience is greatly dependent on what agency you are with. If your agency is timid about asking for more money so that in turn, YOU can continue to climb then you're out of luck. Everyone is pretty collaborative, easy going but hard working. My experience as a TVC was that they didn't care how or when you did something, as long as it was done and on time. You do have to get used to requests from FTE's that can seem frantic, I.E. ""I need this YESTERDAY HELP ME PLEASE!"" but if you can communicate and ease fears of trusting a TVC to complete a task, then you'll do well. Engineers there, both software and hardware, tend to lack communication skills or emotional intelligence so if you can bring that to the role then you'll be greatly appreciated. You get almost all of the same perks like free gym access and food however you do have to pay $1.50 each way on the G Bus shuttles whereas this is free to FTEs. All FTE shopping perks, concerts and happy hours are not extended to TVCs but its not that big of a deal. Overall, great place to be with the RIGHT agency.",,,LAB LOGISTICS COORDINATOR,Former Employee,"Sunnyvale, CA","January 26, 2018"
5.0,Amazing place but caste system,"Google is an amazing place to work. However, there is a distinct caste system among employees.

· Full-time employees are all treated great.
· Full-time contractors are treated very well, with most of the same benefits as FTEs, but on fixed-term contracts.
· Temp/Vendor/Contractors are treated well for non-monetary benefits - ie free shuttles, free food, free use of gym & laundry facilities; no insurance, stock options, bonuses, etc.

This is fairly common practice in Silicon Valley. However, it is the fact that the distinctions between these 3 categories are often blurred, but the TVCs are treated as disposable in a lot of ways.

There is the obvious incentive to work hard as a TVC to earn a promotion to FTC or FTE, but often that path is not transparent and in fact it may be used as an incentive or motivation, when, in actuality, there is no actual path to promotion.",,,Contract Discovery Attorney,Former Employee,"Mountain View, CA","January 26, 2018"
5.0,Fun and Awesome Staff,People are extremely friendly and outgoing. I would definitely improve on helping others stay close to home. Life gets harder when you have to travel far from home.,,,Adecco Temp Service,Former Employee,"Mount Vernon, OH","January 26, 2018"

5.0,it was good,"There is no officially declared fixed timing. Just have to make sure you are on time for meetings and are able to complete your work. Generally, most employees come around 9-10am, and leave at around 7-8pm. Apart from this, Google also lets you work from home in case a situation turns up. Google also refunds for your internet connection at home and provides a 19 inch monitor to work at home. What more could one ask for.",,,SQL Server Database Admin,Former Employee,india,"January 25, 2018"
5.0,Worst hiring process I have ever seen,"Google is not a bad place to work if you get in; however, google has the worst hiring process of any company I have ever seen. The absolute debilitating fear of accidentally hiring the wrong person creates an environment where there is a long winded hiring black box, with almost no feedback what so ever. You might be in communication with a hiring manager one week getting ready for interviews, and the next week, you are no longer being considered, with no explanation, and having not even interviewed. Once you have made it through the notoriously difficult 4 hour back to back interviews, there begins a long mysterious process of going through hiring committees and executive reviews, where there is no feedback. This process took at least a month or more for me, with a solid month between phone and in person interviews, There was also a delay of a couple months between resume submission and any contact from Google.

Once in to Google, being awesome at your job is not quite good enough to get you promoted. You need to demonstrate being awesome at the position two levels above you, to be considered for promo.",,,Information Technology Resident,Current Employee,"Mountain View, CA","January 25, 2018"

A typical day as an Eng. Mgr. is filled with meetings, most of which are actually productive and interesting. The balance is usually spent reading and responding to email or looking through artifacts created by the team you manage.

I've learned how to organize and empower people to be productive and happy engineers. Upper management can often be ignorant of how things are in the trenches but there are excellent tools for bubbling up widespread discontent so it does generally get addressed.

The hardest part of the job tends to be staying abreast of all the change happening across such a gigantic organization, since you never know when something will impact you.

4.0,"great brains, but lacking in expertise","As a consultant it is a very Strange culture. Often overwhelming feeling of being ""on the outside, looking in"" and treatment of contractors is very different than other companies. They try very hard to keep them separate from the employee culture (putting them in their own areas or not integrating them with employees etc) Google has a pool of great brains, graduated from best universities. However their lacking in expertise in the field they are employed leaves them miles behind other tech companies in finding a solution or curing the 'bleeding' - so back office operations are very primitive, and use of BPO's high. Still very manual considering they are a tech giant.
Company needs more diversity in seasoned and experienced employees. People are reclusive here, like there is no other world outside of the company, and entitlement is prevalent.

Benefits culture is good, with free food and activities, however teams still lack cohesion - the kind that other companies have mastered. It seems all the perks won't build a great team, unless you have a good manager that has people skills. Which is something that is lacking here.

Overall, they have good pay, and good work life balance, since no one really is burning the midnight oil here.",,,Consultant/Project Manager,Current Employee,"Google HQ, California","August 11, 2017"

4.0,"There lot's of nice perks, but not great if you're a contractor","Let me start by saying Google has been good to me, even though I am a contractor. I've met many wonderful people and you certainly can't argue with the perks. If I were a fullitme employee I'm almost certain I'd be writing a stellar review, but as a contractor espite all the wonderful benefits and exciting work environment it is simply hard to shake the feeling of being undervalued. It varries from team to team, but unless your team has a high budget and less need (which is never the case) your wage is going to be just enough to live off of. The freedom to stay late and work overtime is sometimes given, and ultimately that is what one must do to even have a shot at a full time role. I have seen several good friends simply leave however once they were able to get the Google name on their resume and it is hard not to notice that one's talents are in demand and more valued elsewhere. I hope that the internal machinery of the company will catch up to the problem of top talen leaving the company, but I recognize there are resource constraints.

2.0,"Passionate developers, blocked by poor management","Working at Fitbit for 3 years, I've seen some smart talented peers. The majority of non-managers were passionate about health, fitness and making customers happy.

Good:
1. Really passionate employees (below manager level)
2. Can wear workout clothes
3. Good location (Embarcadero)

Needs Improvement
The issue comes with very poor management, especially when it comes to making big decisions. Common things:

1. Shipping products that aren't done

2. Say you'll patch old issues in order to ship a product, and then never address it because the previous owner of the product/feature has already moved on to the next thing that needs to be rushed out the door

3. Compensation is well below average for the area, though benefits are pretty good

4. Overall, short-term gain is prioritized with managers and above, and this hurts products in the long term

5. Career advancement is non-existent. It is an afterthought to allow employees to grow into new or more advanced roles, rather it's all about shoving a new (poorly decided) product/feature

6. Employees opinions on the product aren't taken seriously, even though PLENTY of data from departments specifically made to gather that information (Customer Support for customers, Beta testing for internal employees).

7. Talented employees looking to go into different departments, but unable to due to culture of ""I only want to ship my product, I don't have time to help others."" Short-sighted because it helps those teams to have newcomers that already know the ecosystem.

8. HR is poorly structured and is consistently",,,Technical Specialist,Former Employee,"San Francisco, CA","July 9, 2017"

3.0,"Wonderful direct supervisor, terrible upper management","Typical day at work:
Come in, log into system, get right to work gathering products to fulfill customer orders. Help coworkers with hard-to-find items or missing/damaged items.

What I learned:
Work as hard as I can, always be ready to assist the team, keep open communication with management. Don't let any of them abuse their position to make your job harder than it should be.

Management:
The two direct supervisors I worked closest with during my time at Google Express were both very easy-going and hands-off. As long as I got my work done and kept an open line of communication to assist with any complications that might come up, they just left me to my work. Now the other managers and district managers were an entirely different story. They were entirely unwilling to help with anything--whether it be scheduling, points on our records, or just being generally civil, they consistently talked down to and looked down on us. They would ask for our input on streamlining parts of the work process, and proceed not to listen to any of our ideas, until parts of the work programs malfunctioned, or our order queue skyrocketed for weeks at a time.

Workplace culture:
Aside from the aforementioned management problems, coworkers were, for the most part, easy to get along with, and reliable to work with. However, as is the case in most work environments, there were a handful of extremely lazy people. This would not be a problem if it weren't for the fact that the team as a whole works towards fulfilling a total quota for the day.

Since I've worked at the Google Hyderabad office, I am specifically speaking about Google Hyderabad.

Work Timings: There is no officially declared fixed timing. Just have to make sure you are on time for meetings and are able to complete your work. Generally, most employees come around 9-10am, and leave at around 7-8pm. Apart from this, Google also lets you work from home in case a situation turns up. Google also refunds for your internet connection at home and provides a 19 inch monitor to work at home. What more could one ask for.

Work pressure: Google makes sure you don't feel any pressure while working. That's why, we have massage chairs, spa, gym, micro-kitchens (yes, free food), 4 meals a day (breakfast, lunch, snacks, dinner), music rooms, TT tables, cricket nets, and whatnot. Plus, teams are entitled one team outing per year, to get to know each other. They can visit practically any place in the world, and the expenses will be managed by Google.

3.0,The best....unless you're a fixed-term contractor,"First the obvious freebies for all employees and contractors: free breakfast, lunch, and snacks, access to Google gym and fitness classes, and a genuinely great office and facilities (most employees can chose a Macbook, Chromebook, or Windows laptop and many get supplied with the latest Google phones and tablets depending on the team). People are very friendly, motivated, and interesting and it is a genuinely fun workplace with lots of buzz and challenges.

Treatment of TVCs (temps, vendors, and contractors) varies by team and at times it feels like they are considered second-class citizens by management, or ignored altogether. TVCs in some teams can't work from home, use work equipment (laptops, mobile devices etc..) externally, aren't usually entitled to business travel, free Google swag, and most team/company meetings and social events.

As a result many are left feeling a bit ostracised as ""outsiders"". I've never been treated like this as a contractor in my professional career and it leaves a nasty taste in your mouth like you're not trusted or fresh out of college and incompetent.

Converting to a full-time employee is also very hard and being a TVC doesn't really give you a leg-up compared to external candidates. I found recruiters to be disinterested in helping me stay at Google.

Management should treat TVCs better, and less like second class citizens. If you go to the effort of hiring and training them, why not invest in their future and try to find them a permanent role when the contract is up? This occurred to most TVCs in our division so I'm not just referring",,,Merchandiser,Former Employee,"London, UK","January 25, 2017"

5.0,Productive and funny,"Because they work at a consistently fast pace, individuals with a good work ethic are often highly productive. They commonly get large amounts of work done more quickly than others who lack their work ethic, as they don't quit until they've completed the tasks with which they were presented. This high level of productivity is also due, at least in part, to the fact that these individuals want to appear to be strong workers.

There are certain perks and company functions you're not allowed to enjoy, but the biggest caution is that Google is only allowed to keep a temp on for two years. If your contract is renewed after the first year, great. But if they don't hire you on as permanent by the time the second year comes around, start looking for a new gig. In theory, you can be re-hired as a TVC if you are out of the company for a minimum of three months, but I've never seen that happen.

3.0,Don't be a Google Maps GIS Surveyor,"There is a strong divide between working as a contractor for Google vs being an employee. It was like being at the fence of the garden of Eden, looking in at happy Googlers, while sitting just out of reach. Being a Google employee, a ""white badger"", is great. Being a contractor (or TVC as Google calls us) can range from honestly very great, to terrible. If you're a developer who is a contractor, or a manager, life is pretty good. But if you're a worker bee, it's rough. The maps people possibly have the worst of it.

The Google divide is becomes quickly, starkly obvious just after starting. There is no health insurance, and no paid time off when working as a Google Maps surveyor (or any TVC). Traveling extensively, often no where interesting, and staying over the weekend with no option to return home for weeks at a time made this job very hard for me, especially because I have a family. Vacations, even short ones, where highly detrimental to putting food on the table and paying rent.

Google gave me a corporate credit card to pay for daily meals, which was good. BUT the card was heavily micromanaged with daily and weekly reports due for its use. Even though it had a daily expenditure cap. But I was never allowed to gain points for purchases, while my managers quickly become diamond Hilton members making reservations for me... A very clear double standard. You are also expected to enter business spaces and survey but without permission from business and business owners, which didn't sit well with me.

It was also falsely advertised as 50-75% travel, but was actually closer",,,"Adecco contractor, surveyor, Insight, PlaceSense",Former Employee,"Austin, TX","September 11, 2015"

I learned to work both autonomously and collaboratively with other functioning teams to launch projects. My peers are always willing to provide assistance. If my peers cannot help, the least they would do is point me in the right direction. The hardest part of the job is the amount of work everyday.

Drive to the stores and meet up with the store dispatcher to pick up packages then begin route to addresses whee customers lived or worked to deliver packages, after the route finished and we had no more packages left we would drive back to our designate location and either take lunch or if it was ht end of the shift clock out and go home.",,,Courier,Former Employee,"Brooklyn, NY","August 16, 2015"

Its all mentally exhausting, you're cold calling, talking to business owners who get this phone call literally 10 times a day, so by the time you reach them they're irritated an annoyed . You're lucky if they hang up on you mid pitch, otherwise they'll verbally abuse you over the phone. The management isn't the greatest here either, maybe because its a new-ish company . The guy who's supposed to oversea the entire sales floor is only concerned on your Talk Time and Call Numbers ; YES you have a minimum # of calls you have to make by the end of the day. 90 calls 2:30 hrs of talk time, Sounds easy right?

Job Description: Google Express is a same day delivery service that caters to stores such as Target, Walgreens, Costco, and other retailers. The area of Google Express that I work in is in the warehouse where drivers pick up customer orders (parcels) and brings them to the warehouse to be sorted, stowed, picked and given to courier drivers to be delivered.

Typical Day: I would help open the warehouse we work in and take attendance of operators within the shift. I would then obtain the assets needed for a successful work day i.e smartphones, barcode scanners and laptop computers. As soon as I complete that, I assign operators to each of the three work zones: Inbound, Outbound and Prep & Stow based on each individual's physical abilities as well computer knowledge and abilities to carry out tasks required. Throughout the day, I would monitor, as well as help any zone that need back up during our rushes. I mostly supervise the operators and solve any problems that arise as well as guide them in the right direction and train them along the way.

Management: I have had dealings with several managers throughout my time on the project and they all have one thing in common: micromanaging. In my opinion, a leader is one who joins their workers",,,Shift Lead - Warehouse Operations,Current Employee,"San Francisco, CA","April 8, 2015"

Open floor space, can be distracting. Very noisy. Lots of cross-conversations can happen while you're on the phone and people are willfully oblivious to that.
Management's philosophy is to continuously give you feedback, whether you need it or not. Feedback overload is inevitable.
Your co-workers are classified in two categories: The arrogant spoiled brat, and the naive just out of college techno guru who relies exclusively on data and technology and not much on common sense.
The most challenging part of the job is managing your 8-hour day with meetings, appointments, reschedulings and administrative tasks, which according to management should only take a few minutes of your day.
The most enjoyable part of the job,is talking to people over the phone and learning about their business.

When everything is complete I drive to the different addresses listed in my job orders and deliver the parcels that belongs to that customer making sure they have the right amount of parcel, no wrong deliveries and makes sure the parcels are not damaged.

I learned to be patient, courteous, respectful and to put the customers first before anybody else.

Although management is not that good, I respect the people above me and listen to what they have to say unless they instruct me to do something that is unreasonable.

I have no problems with my co-workers. We are all basically by ourselves most of the time anyway.

The hardest part of the job is just at night when the place of delivery is very dark and you are unable to see the house numbers. But to fight that, I bought a big flashlight so I could use it to my advantage when that situation is in front of me.

The most enjoyable part of the job is when I see the customers happy with the kind of service and politeness i give them each and every time.",,,Courier/Delivery Driver,Current Employee,"Sunnyvale, CA","January 20, 2015"

Managers set expectations and unrealistic goals that no one meets in the organization.

3.0,"Very fast-paced, friendly work environment","A typical work day consisted of first, logging into a given Android device, picking the orders shown, paying for them with a given Google credit card, and packing the purchased items securely for take off by the GSX Hub drivers. I learned how to think quickly on solutions to speed up our production, as we had to meet a set amount of pack cut off times for same-day deliveries. This was very challenging at least 80% of the time due to either poor connectivity with androids, packing printers, and low amounts of packing supplies at our workstations. I learned how to better have an adaptive working-style, whether I am placed alone at a vendor location or with a GSX team. We were to contact or ""reach out"" to management via email using our android phones if problems arose. Most of the time it would take a while to get a response, so problem-solving on your own or with your team was definitely a must. Mostly ALL of my co-workers were really great to work with. To be the most productive, it took great communication and jumping in where needed regardless of our set role that day, and we mastered that work flow. This to me, was the most enjoyable part of the job, an awesome crew. The hardest part of the job would have to be trying to make cut offs on time when the equipment given to us malfunctioned, and having to wait on email responses when reaching out about low packing supplies or other hiccups of the day.

2.0,Great place to work if all you need is free meals,"Google's management structure consists of a caste of managers whom freely rotate from project to project irrespective of their past performance or experience. One of the 6 managers I had while I worked there (a period of 5 months) told us that 5/6 of his previous projects had been failures. That's fine for him, but it's likely that all his employees in that department were laid off. It's also likely that they were low-paid contractors. I discovered that a large number of workers at Google were contractors being paid in the $10-14 per hour range. Many of these contractors were also denied the famous free meals, bus service, and facilities of Google. And they were reprimanded for riding the Google bikes, which are also famous for having a 50% theft rate, yet contractors couldn't use them...

The bottom line is, Google makes it's money off of marketing, and cares little for it's employees, contractors, or customers, beyond their ability to generate revenue.

Iv taught new hires and up coming technicians the proper procedures and technical skills needed to preform tech ll duties The great people I have met in my two years here have inspired me to better my education and follow what once was a dream. The reason I rated management low was due to their chain of command, there is none, employee hand book states all employees that have been promoted must wait a period of at least 6 to 8 mounts and management positions a degree / work experience is required before an employee can be eligible to apply for a change of position and/or promotion.
This rule and a bunch others don't apply to friends higher management.
For example there are a hand full of employees have been promoted with out any experience or degree's, actually moved up three to four positions in less then six mounts

Google was an amazing company to work for, and relied on the reps to design and implement our end of the campaign. We were given our goals and a deadline and told to get it done.

I learned the importance in the quality of your work and the effectiveness of listening attentively. Google was the best work experience because it taught me the importance of being on-time and how tardiness/absent affected the company as a whole.

Management at Google was always fair and understanding. I wouldn't have work under anyone else. My supervisors were very efficient in the work they had to do and in overseeing that we were up to par.

My co-workers at Google were always fun and easy to get along with. Some of which I can now say I have formed personal relationships with.

4.0,Still a great place to work with the smartest people you will find,"I have been working for Google 4,5 years at this stage and still love working there. What makes Google fantastic are the people, who are some of the smartest and most interesting you will encounter. However, job satisfaction depends largely on the team that you are in and the management that you are under. Some teams, such as Sales or Acquisitions, have a great deal of mindless administrative work which can be very frustrating. Also work-life balance in Sales is poor, and the wages are not high enough to compensate for this. There is a lot of top-down initiative pushing and revenue pressure, and morale can be quite low as a result. Engineering/Product Management on the other hand seems to be the ""sexiest jobs alive"" at Google. These jobs are very hard to get however, and it helps to have a contact within the firm to be referred.","exceptionally smart people, great culture, diversity, good benefits (free food, healthcare, stock options etc.), great office interior","top-down pressure, insufficient compensation, lack of worklife balance, growing red tape/admin",Media Specialist,Current Employee,Dublin,"March 2, 2012"

The caliber of the people there is super-high, the resources and data available are unmatched, and the problems are challenging and meaningful. While I was there, I felt like a valued employee by my team and the company as a whole. The culture of openness was impressive and changed my views on how a company should be run.

That said, it's not for everyone and the Google of today is not the same as the early 2000's. It has ""grown up"" and lost a lot of the playfulness and deliberate wanderlust that made the company and the brand so powerful and successful.

They have a ton of really smart people there and no matter your role, you will learn stuff from the people around you. For this reason alone, it is a great place to work. The down side is the work/life balance. Google pushes a ton of work onto your plate and they mange to complete it. Plan on eating at work at least 4 nights a week to finish your work.
