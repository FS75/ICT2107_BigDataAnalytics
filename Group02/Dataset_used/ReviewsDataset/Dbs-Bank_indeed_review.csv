1.0,poor management and limited growth,"it depends where we are posted. if you're posted to the branches, your opportunity to grow or earn a higher than the decent amount will be robbed almost instantly. they will randomly throw new roles and duties to staff such as insurance sale or loan officer at you and you're expected to learn and push for sales asap as it will be included in your KPI. you bonus is highly dependent on your sales of insurance, not your work ethics or performance as a service staff. you can give the best service to customers but your bonus will be zero if you don't force insurance sales on customers. branch management is usually extremely poor and the managers/leaders are horribly biased and unprofessional. some managers/seniors get very personal with staff and conveniently forget to behave in a professional manner. complaining to HR just worsen the treatment in the branch as the people in the branch will not treat you kindly after knowing you burst their bubble. The working hours are longer than expected and there is no compensation for the extra time you put in. once in a while you will receive items like nuts or muffins for your hard work, not extra pay or a justified bonus. the managers are not helpful and you live with stress every minute in the job as they are just out to expose your mistakes. one mistake made will be used as leverage for them to scare you throughout the year. you will be reminded of it during your appraisal when they reveal how little bonus you're getting. colleagues are average although most of them are backstabbers or rats. it is not an enjoyable workplace, neither does",,,Service Executive,Former Employee,Singapore,"May 30, 2020"
